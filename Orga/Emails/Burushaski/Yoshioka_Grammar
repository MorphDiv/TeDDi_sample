Dear Dr. Yoshioka,

my name is Chris Bentz, I’m a PostDoc at the University of Zurich involved in a project to build a text corpus for 100 typologically diverse languages in order to also give under-resourced languages a place in corpus linguistics (https://www.spur.uzh.ch/en/departments/research/textgroup/MorphDiv.html). Particularly for some of the smaller languages it is a difficult task to find text material. In our search we came across your publication of the “A refrence grammar of Eastern Burushaski”. I would like to inquire whether you would have objections if we extract the example sentences in this grammar in order to get machine readable texts of Burushaski, of course with reference to your original work. The aim is to eventually make the 100 language corpus available under a CC by 4.0 license to the public.

Also, if you have further texts on the language (e.g. in the form of hand-written field notes) that you are willing to share, we have some funds available and are currently developing some expertise at automatically transcribing hand-written manuscripts. So this could be mutually profitable.

Thanks for your time,
Chris Bentz
