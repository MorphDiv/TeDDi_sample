#ANNOTATION DECISIONS

Lines: Each line (often sentence) of a text is marked by <x>, where x is the line number (running number from 1)
Segmentation: If a segmentation (e.g. by morphemes) is given, this is marked with <segmentation>
Glosses: The line with glosses is marked with <gloss>
Translation: The line with translation is marked with <translation>

Line breaks: Put an empty line between the sentences but not between the sentence, segmentation, gloss, and translation.
White spaces: white spaces should be added around punctuation marks (on both sides).
Footnotes: remove footnotes from text and glosses
