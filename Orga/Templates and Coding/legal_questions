Legal questions and answers (meeting with Nadia Steiner on 24th January 2019)

General question: 
	- if we publish texts on a University of Zurich server, then Swiss law applies, correct?
	In principle yes. If the texts are uploaded to a server in Zurich then "Handlungsort" is Switzerland. However, if a text was originally published for example in the US, then it might be argued that US laws apply. Unclear situation. 


Online texts: 
	- is it possible to re-publish text (with slight modifications, e.g. adding white spaces) that are already openly available on the internet (e.g. wikipedia articles)?
	Slight modifications such as adding white spaces should be alright since they do not change the quality of the work per se. There is copyright also on openly available texts such as 		wikipedia articles.
	- how about texts from websites which require a password to access the texts?
	Openly available or password protected does not make a difference for copyright.

Books and articles published by publishers:
 	- is there a time period after which copyright expires, e.g. we can use texts published more than x years ago?
	Yes. 70 years after death of the author copyright expires also for the publisher (relatives theoretically still have copyright) and the text will be in the "public domain".
	- can we collect and publish example sentences in grammars with respective glosses and translation?
	Individual sentences do normally not count as "Gesamtwerk". If sentences are clearly identifiable with a particular author (as in the case of grammar examples) there is still copyright. Best to ask authors of grammars for permission if many examples are extracted.
	- can we "cite" a whole chunk of text (which size in number of words?) which has been published for example as an appendix to a grammar?
	The "Zitationsrecht" normally implies that the citing author puts the citation in the context of a wider discussion. The rule of fair use as known in the US (using chunks of text of a certain size should be ok) is not applicable in Switzerland.


Grammars that have not been published by publishers:
 	- there is a range of grammars of languages which have not been officially published by a publisher, but which are openly available as pdfs on the internet.
    	Is there still a "natural" copyright on these? What would this entail?
	Yes, there is still copyright and it is better to ask the respective authors for permission.

Contacting authors/publishers:
	- if we contact publishers/authors for permissions, can you help us with a template for what to ask them in terms of permissions?
	Yes, it is possible to use a "Einverstaendiserklaerung" though a safed e-mail exchange might be sufficient.

License:
	- when we eventually publish our corpus online what kind of license agreement should we choose for the website?
	Some form of CC, further clarify closer to the date of publication.
