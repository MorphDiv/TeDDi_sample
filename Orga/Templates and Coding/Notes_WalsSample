Notes on WALS language sample

31.10.2018
In WALS, the language "Asmat" is associated with ISO code tml. According to Glottolog 3.3, this ISO code is assigned to the language "Tamnim Citak" (variety of Asmat). There seems to be a misunderstanding by WALS, as it cites Voorhoeve (1965) "The Flamingo Bay Dialect of the Asmat Language" as a grammatical reference for "Asmat" and assigns this variety to the ISO code tml. However, Voorhoeve (1980) clearly assigns the Flamigo Bay variety to Central Asmat which takes ISO code cns also in Glottolog 3.3. So the ISO code of Asmat in WALS should probably be changed to cns instead of tml.

The language Wichi (WALS ISO code mzh) is further subdivided into varieties Wichí Lhamtés Nocten (mtp),  Wichí Lhamtés Vejoz (wlv),  Wichí Lhamtés Güisnay (mzh) by Glottolog. They carry unique ISO-codes and would hence be conceptualized as different languages according to ISO code criterion. However, the Grammar by Terraza (2009) states that these varieties are rather dialects than separate languages.
