# comments:	The example sentences are mainly taken from other grammars. The references to these are given in comments here. It should be noted that sentences attributed to "Anderson et al. 1998" are often repetitive in their lexical material (involving a boy, girl, woman and man), and are hence very likely sentences made up by the authors, rather than recorded. The full reference list can be found in Anderson & Eggert (2001). The original example sentences are morphologically segmented (given in <segmentation>. We here remove the hyphens to derive the orthography gine in <line_x>.
