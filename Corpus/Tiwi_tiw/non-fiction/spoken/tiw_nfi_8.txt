# special_characters:	Citing from Lee (1987), p. 21: "Primary stress (´), is predictable and therefore non-phonemic, occurring on the penultimate syllable of the word . In words of more than three syllables a secondary stress normally (`) occurs on the initial syllable. In these words the positions of other secondary stresses are more difficult to predict as the situation is different for nouns and verbs."
# short_description:	Citing from Lee (1987), p. 393: "A selection of texts is given showing the various styles along the continuum of the verbal repertoire of the Tiwi speech community. The texts chosen are basically narrative style, though some of the later ones have conversation in them (interpolations by other speakers). For this reason, the TT text and the ones which are slightly less traditional do not contain the verbal or syntactical complexity which occurs in other types of discourse, such as hortatory discourse." Lee, p. 393: "Text H is basically casual MT, i.e. normally with no auxiliaries given for the free verbs. It is given by a boy of ten. The texts A to H are, in general, monologues given in formal settings. So the eight year old girl and the twelve year old boy give a simple style of MT which is their more formal style of Tiwi. It is not certain whether the boy who gave text H knows and is able to produce a more formal style of Tiwi. Since he comes from a family in which some of the young members (including his mother and aunt, both in their twenties) normally do not speak a style much closer to TT, this is possibly his most formal Tiwi style, though he probably understands other styles." <1> Footnote 1: His aunt made the comment to me that she could not understand her father when he talked 'hard language'. This text is given the title: Text H (MT/CT) ‘A visit to Darwin’ (JV10). TT means Traditional Tiwi and MT means Modern Tiwi.
