# special_characters:	Citing from Lee (1987), p. 21: "Primary stress (´), is predictable and therefore non-phonemic, occurring on the penultimate syllable of the word . In words of more than three syllables a secondary stress normally (`) occurs on the initial syllable. In these words the positions of other secondary stresses are more difficult to predict as the situation is different for nouns and verbs."
# short_description:	Citing from Lee (1987), p. 393: "A selection of texts is given showing the various styles along the continuum of the verbal repertoire of the Tiwi speech community. The texts chosen are basically narrative style, though some of the later ones have conversation in them (interpolations by other speakers). For this reason, the TT text and the ones which are slightly less traditional do not contain the verbal or syntactical complexity which occurs in other types of discourse, such as hortatory discourse." Lee, p. 393: "In text J, while being in a formal setting, i.e. at preschool, the speech and structure is basically casual MT, given by a young teacher's aide to a class of preschoolers. There are some interpolations from children within the text, usually as responses to questions asked." This text is given the title: Text J (Cas MT) ‘A picture talk about children playing’ (EP20). TT means Traditional Tiwi and MT means Modern Tiwi.

# comments:	Citing from Lee (1987), p. 404: "There are a number of interpolations by children and where the speaker is known, he/she is given by their initials and age, and their speech is put in parenthesis. The basic text is given by a teacher's aide (aged about twenty) to a class of preschool children, eventually about a picture of children playing on swings etc.
