# special_characters:	Citing from Lee (1987), p. 21: "Primary stress (´), is predictable and therefore non-phonemic, occurring on the penultimate syllable of the word . In words of more than three syllables a secondary stress normally (`) occurs on the initial syllable. In these words the positions of other secondary stresses are more difficult to predict as the situation is different for nouns and verbs."
# short_description:	Citing from Lee (1987), p. 393: "A selection of texts is given showing the various styles along the continuum of the verbal repertoire of the Tiwi speech community. The texts chosen are basically narrative style, though some of the later ones have conversation in them (interpolations by other speakers). For this reason, the TT text and the ones which are slightly less traditional do not contain the verbal or syntactical complexity which occurs in other types of discourse, such as hortatory discourse." This text is given the title: Text G (MT) ‘When we played at the oval’ <18> (JP8). Footnote 18: This text has not been studied for sentence breaks, which are often hard to determine in the speech of children as there are so many stops and starts and kiyi is put in willy-nilly as a gap filler. The breaks made are those which seem logical semantically.

<footnote_21>	I am not sure what this means, wheter it means ‘stay at’. If this is so it seems to refute the next sentence where the play is taking place at the oval. It may be that the speaker has simply omitted the connecting sentence telling of the movement from one place to the other. The two places are very close.
<footnote_22>	ka nayi is often used by children where it has the sense ‘there’ or ‘at there’.
