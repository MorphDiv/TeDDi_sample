# special_characters:	Citing from Lee (1987), p. 21: "Primary stress (´), is predictable and therefore non-phonemic, occurring on the penultimate syllable of the word . In words of more than three syllables a secondary stress normally (`) occurs on the initial syllable. In these words the positions of other secondary stresses are more difficult to predict as the situation is different for nouns and verbs."
# short_description:	Citing from Lee (1987), p. 393: "A selection of texts is given showing the various styles along the continuum of the verbal repertoire of the Tiwi speech community. The texts chosen are basically narrative style, though some of the later ones have conversation in them (interpolations by other speakers). For this reason, the TT text and the ones which are slightly less traditional do not contain the verbal or syntactical complexity which occurs in other types of discourse, such as hortatory discourse." Lee, p. 393: "Texts D and E are given by young people in their early twenties or late teens, and while basically traditional, there are some differences and the verb forms are not as complex, in that, there are no incorporated forms, the only verbal prefixes indicate subject person and tense, (though other texts by the same speakers do contain some other prefixes), and the verb stems used are fairly common ones. Text E contains some interpolations by children in children's Tiwi." This text is given the title: Text E (LTT) ‘Making bread’ (MP22). (A picture talk on a book about making bread). TT means Traditional Tiwi and MT means Modern Tiwi.
