# comments:	The text is given in Voorhoeve (1965) as a running text with systematic punctuation, but without further segmentation into sentences or phrases. We here attempt to further segment the text into sentences by using punctuation marks as an orientation. There are footnotes which either contain clarifications (marked with letters), or alternative spellings/pronunciations/word-forms (marked with numbers). The last sentence does not seem to be translated and hence '_ _' in the translation. It literally translates to 'then not' and probably means 'the end'.
