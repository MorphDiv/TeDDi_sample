ftp_nb_fget() retrieves remote_file from the FTP server, and writes it to the given file pointer, handle. The transfer mode specified must be either FTP_ASCII or FTP_BINARY. The difference between this function and the ftp_fget() is that this function retrieves the file asynchronously, so your program can perform other operations while the file is being downloaded.
成功した場合に TRUE 、失敗した場合に FALSE を返します。
