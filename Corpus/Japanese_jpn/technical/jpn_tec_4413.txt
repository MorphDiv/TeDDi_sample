(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
Returns information about an existing stream. The stream can be any stream created by fopen(), fsockopen() and pfsockopen(). The result array contains the following items:
timed_out (bool) - TRUE if the stream timed out while waiting for data on the last call to fread() or fgets().
blocked (bool) - TRUE if the stream is in blocking IO mode. See socket_set_blocking().
eof (bool) - TRUE if the stream has reached end-of-file. Note that for socket streams this member can be TRUE even when unread_bytes is non-zero. To determine if there is more data to be read, use feof() instead of reading this item.
unread_bytes (int) - the number of bytes currently contained in the read buffer.
The following items were added in PHP 4.3:
stream_type (string) - a label describing the underlying implementation of the stream.
wrapper_type (string) - a label describing the protocol wrapper implementation layered over the stream. See 付録I for more information about wrappers.
wrapper_data (mixed) - wrapper specific data attached to this stream. See 付録I for more information about wrappers and their wrapper data.
filters (array) - and array containing the names of any filters that have been stacked onto this stream. Filters are currently undocumented.
注意 This function was introduced in PHP 4.3, but prior to this version, socket_get_status() could be used to retrieve the first four items, for socket based streams only.
In PHP 4.3 and later, socket_get_status() is an alias for this function.
注意 This function does NOT work on sockets created by the Socket extension.
