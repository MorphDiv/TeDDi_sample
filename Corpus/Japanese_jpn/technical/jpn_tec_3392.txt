ircg_pconnect() will try to establish a connection to an IRC server and return a connection resource handle for further use.
The only mandatory parameter is username, this will set your initial nicknake on the server. server_ip and server_port are optional and default to 127.0.0.1 and 6667.
注意 For now parameter server_ip will not do any hostname lookups and will only accept IP addresses in numerical form.
You can customize the output of IRC messages and events by selection a format string set previously created with ircg_register_format_messages() by specifing the sets name in msg_format.
