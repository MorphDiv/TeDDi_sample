(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
php_ini_scanned_files() returns a comma-separated list of configuration files parsed after php.ini. These files are found in a directory defined by the --with-config-file-scan-dir. option which is set during compilation.
Returns a comma-separated string of .ini files on success. If the directive --with-config-files-scan-dir wasn't set, FALSE is returned. If it was set and the directory was empty, an empty string is returned. If a file is unreconizable, the file will still make it into the returned string but a PHP error will also result. This PHP error will be seen both at compile time and while using php_ini_scanned_files().
The returned configuration files also include the path as declared in the --with-config-file-scan-dir directive. Also, each comma is followed by a newline.
