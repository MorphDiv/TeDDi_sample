mysql_ping() checks whether or not the connection to the server is working. If it has gone down, an automatic reconnection is attempted. This function can be used by scripts that remain idle for a long while, to check whether or not the server has closed the connection and reconnect if necessary. mysql_ping() returns TRUE if the connection to the server is working, otherwise FALSE.
