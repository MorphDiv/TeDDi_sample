Arrays are stored using Zend's internal hash tables, which can be accessed using the zend_hash_*() API. For every array that you want to create, you need a new hash table handle, which will be stored in the ht member of the zval.value container.
There's a whole API solely for the creation of arrays, which is extremely handy. To start a new array, you call array_init().
To add new elements to the array, you can use numerous functions, depending on what you want to do. 表33-1, 表33-2 and 表33-3 describe these functions. All functions return FAILURE on failure and SUCCESS on success.
表 33-1Zend's API for Associative Arrays
表 33-2Zend's API for Indexed Arrays, Part 1
表 33-3Zend's API for Indexed Arrays, Part 2
All these functions provide a handy abstraction to Zend's internal hash API. Of course, you can also use the hash functions directly - for example, if you already have a zval container allocated that you want to insert into an array. This is done using zend_hash_update()() for associative arrays (see 例33-3) and zend_hash_index_update() for indexed arrays (see 例33-4):
例 33-3Adding an element to an associative array.
例 33-4Adding an element to an indexed array.
To emulate the functionality of add_next_index_*(), you can use this:
Note: To return arrays from a function, use array_init() and all following actions on the predefined variable return_value (given as argument to your exported function; see the earlier discussion of the call interface). You do not have to use MAKE_STD_ZVAL on this.
Tip: To avoid having to write new_array- value.ht every time, you can use HASH_OF(new_array), which is also recommended for compatibility and style reasons.
