(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
Returns an array of integer values pertaining to the specified user mailbox. All values contain a key based upon the resource name, and a corresponding array with the usage and limit values within.
The limit value represents the total amount of space allowed for this user's total mailbox usage. The usage value represents the user's current total mailbox capacity. This function will return FALSE in the case of call failure, and an array of information about the connection upon an un-parsable response from the server.
This function is currently only available to users of the c-client2000 or greater library.
imap_stream should be the value returned from an imap_open() call. This stream should be opened as the user whose mailbox you wish to check. quota_root should normally be in the form of which mailbox (i.e. INBOX).
