(PHP 4 = 4.0.6)
Returns an associative array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
fbsql_fetch_assoc() is equivalent to calling fbsql_fetch_array() with FBSQL_ASSOC for the optional second parameter. It only returns an associative array. This is the way fbsql_fetch_array() originally worked. If you need the numeric indices as well as the associative, use fbsql_fetch_array().
If two or more columns of the result have the same field names, the last column will take precedence. To access the other column(s) of the same name, you must use fbsql_fetch_array() and have it return the numeric indices as well.
An important thing to note is that using fbsql_fetch_assoc() is NOT significantly slower than using fbsql_fetch_row(), while it provides a significant added value.
