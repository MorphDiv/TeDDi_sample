(PHP 4 = 4.2.0)
In case of the termination of connection connection IRCG will connect to host at port (Note: host must be an IPv4 address, IRCG does not resolve host-names due to blocking issues), send data to the new host connection and will wait until the remote part closes connection. This can be used to trigger a php script for example.
