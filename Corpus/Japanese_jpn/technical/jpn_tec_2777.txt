Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
fbsql_fetch_array() is an extended version of fbsql_fetch_row(). In addition to storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also stores the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.
If two or more columns of the result have the same field names, the last column will take precedence. To access the other column(s) of the same name, you must the numeric index of the column or make an alias for the column.
An important thing to note is that using fbsql_fetch_array() is NOT significantly slower than using fbsql_fetch_row(), while it provides a significant added value.
The optional second argument result_type in fbsql_fetch_array() is a constant and can take the following values: FBSQL_ASSOC, FBSQL_NUM, and FBSQL_BOTH.
