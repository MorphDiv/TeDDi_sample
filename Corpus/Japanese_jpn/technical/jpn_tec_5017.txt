php_stream_is() returns 1 if stream is of the type specified by istype, or 0 otherwise.
表 43-1Values for istype
注意 The PHP_STREAM_IS_XXX "constants" are actually defined as pointers to the underlying stream operations structure. If your extension (or some other extension) defines additional streams, it should also declare a PHP_STREAM_IS_XXX constant in it's header file that you can use as the basis of this comparison.
注意 This function is implemented as a simple (and fast) pointer comparision, and does not change the stream state in any way.
