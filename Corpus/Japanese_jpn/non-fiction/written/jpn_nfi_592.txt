ああ

しかし　あの事故で よく助かりましたね
あー　これね
You came up here to investigate Drew Neely's murder, right?
Right.
Problem is, no one's certain it was a murder at all.
Okay, then what are we dealing with here?
A suicide?
Self

Uh, the surveillance footage was corrupted.
Our techies finally managed to clean up the file.
Hold on a sec now.
[ Door opens ]
[ Door closes ]
We can do this however you want.
Don't pretend I didn't see you this afternoon.
Did you get a good look?

I hope so, 'cause I sure could use the competition.
Dugan:

is the one you want to keep your eye on.
Son of a bitch.
Watch.
Well, all you Abaddon groupies are the same, you know that?
You, the douche that jumped me at the gas station,
you can't just can't accept that the queen is dead, can you?
Maybe we just can't accept
that a douche like you was the one who killed her.
Ah.
Yeah, that's got to hurt, doesn't it?
Okay, now, porn guy's just minding his own business.
And there's Drew Neely.
See the knife?
Sam:

That's intent right there.
Now watch this.
Man:

[ Electricity zaps ]
[ Groans ]
Looks like a cutlass or something.
I don't know what the hell this is.
Problem is, we don't know
if this guy's a hero or a psychopath.
[ Mouse clicks ]
That's the image that's getting uploaded to the wires.
Sam:

take another look at this?
Knock yourself out.
I'll be back in a few.
All right.
[ Keyboard clacking ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Grunting rhythmically ]
[ Grunting rhythmically ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Fax machine beeping ]
Cole:

Fax, Dad.
[ Sighs ] Who's it from, buddy?
Doesn't say.

Thanks a lot, bud.
Is it him?
[ Zipper clicks ]
[ Engine shuts off ]
[ Door closes ]
I didn't know angels could get nauseous.
I just need a moment.

[ Sighs ]
It's my fault.

And you, Castiel?
You're feeling well?
Oh, yes.
Like a million dollars.
That's not true.
It's my truth.
When you left heaven, your borrowed Grace was failing.
By the looks of you, you've only gotten worse.
I'm fine.
You're dying, Castiel.
You need more Grace.
And we have a mission in front of us
that supersedes my needs

Don't you agree?
You're a good soldier, Hannah...
And one of the best.
Metatron certainly could not have been brought to heel
without your bravery.
Or yours.
You must take care of yourself, Castiel.
And another angel should die so that I can be saved?
Is this really that hard to understand?
Hannah.
I'm feeling better now.
[ Car door closes ]
Man:

Porn guy was an animal.
Bro came at him like, "what?

and he was all like, "wh

"say my name!

Say my name."
[ grunts ]
[ Sighs ]
And there was a lot of blood.
Right.
Um...
When the guy, uh

[ clears throat ]
When...
"Porn guy" came in, did he...

"W

That's all he said?
Did he buy anything?
Did he

Nothing?
So some guy comes in,
kills another guy in your store on your watch,
and you just

you what?

You mean when porn guy was stabbing the other guy to death
10 feet in front of me,
and I was having a total code

in my favorite freakin' pants because I thought I was next,
did I conduct a field interview?
No.
[ Paper rustles ]
Oh, hey.

Found this wedged under the T.

I think it's the dead guy's phone,
and, uh, if you're heading back to the station...
[ Cellphone beeps ]
[ Cellphone ringing, rock music plays ]
You're dead.
Sam:

Just using a dead man's phone.
Moose.

Your brother and I were beginning to wonder
if you'd hit another dog.
You know?
My brother is dead, Crowley.
I know you have some freaking demon
parading around in his meatsuit,
and trust me, you are gonna pay for that.
[ Chuckling ] Moose.

I'm afraid you haven't allowed yourself
to dream quite big enough here.
Your brother is very much alive, courtesy of the mark.
And the only demonized soul inside of Dean
is his and his alone.
Wee bit more twisted,
a little more mangled beyond human recognition,
but, I can assure you, all his.
There, now.

And the, uh, Abaddon supporters you've been sending
to kill my brother,
how does Dean feel about that double

If that's what you think is happening,
then you're more out of your depths than I thought.
I don't know how you did this,
what kind of...

but hear me

I will save my brother
or die trying.
You know what tickles me about all this?
It's what's really eating you up.
You don't care that he's a demon.
Heck, you've been a demon.
We've all been demons.
No, it's that he's with me
and he's having the time of his life.
You can't stand the fact that he's mine.
He's not your pet.
My pet?
He's my best friend,
my partner in crime.
They'll write songs about us, graphic novels.
"The Misadventures of Growley and Squirrel."
Dean Winchester completes me,
and that's what makes you lose your chickens.
I am going to find you,
I am going to save my brother,
and then I'm going to kill you dead.
Well, that's the operative phrase, isn't it?
"Find you."
good luck with that.
[ Click ]
[ Cellphone pinging ]
[ Pinging stops ]
[ Engine shuts off ]
Castiel: Daniel.
What are you fishing for?
Trout, mostly.
They do love a good curlytail grub.
Trick is to find that special spot
just outside the run,
where the big ones

the smart ones

Do they

The ones who truly want to be free?
They do.
You're here about our brother who died.
Does that surprise you?

Had he just left us alone, no one would've been harmed.
His orders were to not leave you alone.
And you killed him.
And heaven sends two more.
What is it about us angels
that we can't seem to get the message?
Perhaps it is you who has failed to get the message?
All of us serve at heaven's command.
Daniel: I suppose.
But that was before the fall, wasn't it?
You are an angel, once and forever.
Dropped unwillingly...
Unknowingly...
Into a strange land,
a land that, as it turns out,
celebrates the free, the individual.
For the first time in thousands of years,
I have choices.
And with each choice...
I begin to discover who I really am.
This is nonsense.
Because they don't teach you this in heaven?
Perhaps they should.
Then you would understand why it's worth fighting for.
He's taunting us.
Castiel: And then what?
We kill him?
Castiel: Or he kills us?
There are orders.
And there is time.
To hear more of this?
To convince him to do the right thing.
Besides, Hannah,
we still don't even know where the other one is

the woman.
You'll have to stay for sunset.
Nighttime around here is a revelation.
You sent those demons to kill me?
To keep you sharp.
Really?
If it wasn't for me throwing demon chum your way,
what do you think would've happened?
The mark needs to be sated.
Otherwise

Yeah, yeah.
I sort of got that six weeks ago.
Just trying to help.
You lied.
Who do you think you're talking to here?
Does the tin man have a sheet

Of course I lied.
Okay.
Hey.

Sit.
I needed to keep you sharp for our future,
about which we need to talk.
Our future?
Our professional future.
How to put this?
If I have to spend one more night
in this fetid petri dish of broken dreams and B.

I will cut off my own face.
I don't know what you're talking about.
'Cause I'm good.
Hell, I'm great.
Really?
How many suicide wings can you eat?
How many one

Okay, see, the deal was we howl at the moon

no time stamp, no expiration date.
We've howled.
We've bayed.
W

all of which have been massively entertaining.
I will treasure our Flickr albums forever.
But now it's time for us to accept what we are
and go back to work.
Pass.
Think of it

the king of hell, Dean Winchester by his side.
Together we rule.
Together we create the perfect hell.
And all of this that's bloomed between us never ends.
We're not ending the party.
We're just moving the party.
Out with the club circuit, in with the stadium tour.
Oh.
Did I forget to mention I spoke to moose earlier?
What?
Yes.
Uh, apparently, he's been tracking us for some time now.
He got my text from the cell of that demon
that you stabbed in blah, blah, blah.
It was

words were spoken

I realize, in retrospect,
perhaps too many words, too many emotions.
He traced the call.
My bad.
I guess he'll be here by morning

You sold me out.
Well, that's just lovely.
I don't know what's going on with you.
I truly don't.
But I've had just about enough of it.
Sold you out?
Try "doing you a favor."
everything I've done for you for the past six months

the mark, the First Blade, midwifing you back to life,
offering you a seat by my side

has been a favor, a gift, whether you see it or you don't.
Take the night.
Decide.
You know where to find me.
[ Engine rattling ]
[ Engine clattering ]
[ Engine turns off ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Car door opens ]
Hey.

Need some help?
Uh...
Yeah.

It just died on me.

Yeah.
Your ride really has it out for you, huh?
[ Chuckles ] I guess so.
Give you a hand with that?
Yeah.

Thanks.
[ Latch clicks ]
Ah...
These new cars and their computerized brains, huh?
One zero out of place, and the whole thing just goes kaput.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, right there.

What the hell is that?
Well, that's a kill switch.
This here is the remote.
[ Zip tie clicks ]
Guessing you're a righty.

We are somewhere.
No.
[ Groans ]
Somewhere else.
Sweetie...
We barely know each other.
And you're drunk.
Yeah, but, uh...
I

Yeah.

Seeing you take on Matt, I was like, "wow""
no one's ever done that for me before.
But then you kept going and going,
and I realized whatever is going on with you
has nothing to do with my "honor" at all.
Hm.
You got all that from a bar fight?
Wow.
You're good.
I wait tables at a roadhouse.
I meet the bad guys.

And maybe for a second there,
I thought you were a good guy playing bad.
I don't know.

[ Sighs ] Maybe you're just

The kind of guy who sleeps with every skank
in every small

Well, you really do know how to read people,
'cause that sure as hell sounds like me.
Now, see?
I'm so screwed up myself
I'm gonna walk out of here
thinking I actually deserved that.
[ Door opens ]
[ Door closes ]
What I'll never understand
is why angels won't acknowledge
the wisdom to be found down here.
What wisdom is to be gained from humans?
I'm not speaking to you.
Do you understand what he's...
Fine.
But if you are to be free,
that is to be decided by all angels.
There's that angelic irony.
We're not going back there.
Not ever.
Adina.
This is Hannah and Castiel.
Stow the blade, please.
When she stows hers.
Hannah, what are you doing?
We'll never get a chance to argue our freedom
from a prison cell.
You should've thought of that before slaughtering one of your own.
Daniel: No, no.

We were getting somewhere.
Okay, everybody just

Go ahead.

Hannah.
Stop this.
Adina:

Daniel.
[ Grunting ]
No!
[ Breathing heavily ]
Aah!
[ Groans, coughs ]
[ Coughs ]
We have to get her.
[ Both breathing heavily ]
[ Grunts ]
She's gone.
We have to.

It's over.
[ Grunts, sighs ]
[ Door opens ]
Cole:

Okay.

Sam:

[ Sighs ]
Breathe.
[ Breathing heavily ]
There you go.
You good, partner?
How's that chicken wing?
Who are you?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Sighs ]
First time I broke my arm,
my older brother, Davey,
had me riding on the handles of his three

Decided to pop us a wheelie,
look real fancy for all the little pretties outside the DQ.
Well, we were looking mighty good for a little bit.
[ Sighs ]
And then, "whoop""
ass end over teakettle, boy.
Hurt like a son of a bitch.
You're Sam Winchester.
I think we both can agree on that.
And your older brother, Dean, well...
He and I, we go way back.
You're a hunter?
Sure.
Yeah, we can go with that.
Hunting your brother counts, right?
[ Scoffs ]
I wouldn't do that.
[ Chuckling ] Yeah.
Trust me.
Look, buddy, I

I don't what you want or what my brother did,
but if you got any sense, I suggest you turn tail
and run back to that army recruiting ad
that spit you out in the first place.
[ Chuckles softly ]
He's a monster.
Well, he was.
Yeah, he was...
Many, many moons ago.
But now he's prey.
And I'm the monster now.
We have to report this.
And say what?
Things got out of control?
Another angel has died.
He was going to kill me, Castiel.
They just wanted to be left alone.
Without rules, there is chaos.
Out of chaos rise angels like Naomi, Bartholomew...
Metatron.
Well, perhaps I've been down here with them
for too long.
There's seemingly nothing but chaos.
But not all bad comes from it.
Art.
Hope.
Love.
Dreams.
But t

Yes.
[ Cellphone ringing ]
[ Cellphone beeps ]
I left you an open tab at the bar.
Knock yourself out.
Well, hell, I just may take you up on that.
And who is this?
Me?
Well, I'm karma, brother.
On my brother's phone?
On your brother's phone.
Is he dead?
No.

And as long as you show up where I tell you to show up,
your brother will be just fine.
And how do I know he's still alive?
Speak.
[ Sighs ]
Sam:

Proof of life.
Dean!
Got a pen?
No, you listen to me.
There's no trade.
There's no meet

except the 100% guarantee that, somewhere down the road,
I will find you, and I will kill you.
[ Sighs ]
Well, that'll be a cold comfort to your dead brother.
I told him to let me go.
So whatever jam he's in now, that is his problem.
Yeah, well, I'll be sure to pass that on to him
as I'm slitting his throat.
Yeah, you do that, 'cause he knows me.
And he knows damn sure that if I am one thing,
I am a man of my word.
