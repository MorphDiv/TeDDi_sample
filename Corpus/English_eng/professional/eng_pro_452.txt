Annex to the letter dated 13 July 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
[Original: Russian]
Declaration by the heads of State of the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Astana, 5 June 2005)
The heads of State of the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter “SCO” or “the Organization”) — the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan — gathered in Astana at a meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Members of SCO on 5 July 2005 declare the following:
In the period that has elapsed since the meeting of heads of State held in Tashkent on 17 June 2004, all the tasks set on that occasion with a view to further developing and strengthening SCO have virtually been completed.
The Organization is advancing confidently on the path of expanding multilateral cooperation among its member States and is actively cooperating with other international organizations and countries.
The standing organs of SCO — the Secretariat in Beijing and the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure in Tashkent — which have been operational since 2004, are becoming effective collective instruments, ensuring the uninterrupted functioning of the Organization.
Note was taken of the important role played by the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure's executive organ, the Council, which must be increased.
The heads of State agreed that, in order to increase the effectiveness and coordination of the work of SCO and all its organs and mechanisms, the Council of National Coordinators should prepare, in time for the next summit meeting in 2006, proposals for strengthening the role of the Secretariat and amending the title of its chief to Secretary-General of SCO.
The heads of State noted the importance of taking the necessary steps to implement the agreements reached at the second meeting of Secretaries of Security Councils of the States members of SCO, which took place on 2 June 2005 in Astana.
In order to assist the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure in implementing the Shanghai Convention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism, the heads of State agreed to establish the institution of permanent representatives of member States to the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure, based on the same principles as those governing the functioning of the institution of permanent representatives of member States to the Secretariat.
The heads of State are confident that the Framework Document on cooperation among the States members of SCO in combating terrorism, separatism and extremism adopted at the summit will increase the effectiveness of such cooperation and make the activities of the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure more efficient and targeted.
The heads of State are proceeding on the basis that, at its forthcoming meeting, to be held in autumn 2005 in Moscow, the Council of Heads of Government (prime ministers) will give real impetus to the implementation of the Plan of Measures to give effect to the Programme on multilateral trade and economic cooperation among the States members of SCO, adopted in September 2004, and to the development of practical cooperation among the ministries and departments responsible for foreign economic and foreign trade activities, transport, environmental protection, emergency situations, culture and education, as well as approving a rational financial and budgetary policy for SCO.
The SCO Business Council, the establishment of which is entering its final phase, should become a new tool for stimulating integration processes within the framework of the Organization.
The parties will expedite the creation of the SCO development fund based on the principles they agreed.
At the same time, they agreed to strengthen inter-bank cooperation with a view to providing financial support for the implementation of regional cooperation projects.
While noting the significant and constructive work carried out by the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, the heads of State emphasize the importance of the efficient functioning of the consultation mechanism on international issues already established.
They also consider it vital to ensure that SCO develops its international contacts in a well-thought-out and targeted manner.
Such issues should, as a matter of principle, be decided by the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, while the day-to-day coordination of contacts established by the standing organs of SCO should be undertaken by the Council of National Coordinators, in cooperation with the Council of the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure.
The heads of State are confident that the granting to Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and India of observer status with SCO will expand the Organization's capacity to develop multilateral and mutually advantageous cooperation in various areas.
The granting to the Organization of observer status with the United Nations General Assembly in December 2004 and the signing of memorandums of understanding between SCO and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and between SCO and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in April 2005 are important indicators of the Organization's growing authority in the international arena.
In the near future, the Council of National Coordinators, together with the Secretariat and the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure, must elaborate common approaches so that SCO is able, with maximum efficiency, to develop links with the United Nations Secretariat, its commissions and committees, implement documents on cooperation signed with other international organizations and establish ties with regional associations and forums, as well as with interested States, on the basis of equality and mutual respect.
The heads of State note that, against the backdrop of the contradictory process of globalization, multilateral cooperation based on the principles of equality and mutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries, non-confrontational thinking and consistent progress towards the democratization of international relations, contributes to the maintenance of international peace and security and call on the international community, irrespective of differences in ideology and social systems, to develop a new concept of security, based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and cooperation.
The diversity of the world's cultures and civilizations is a common human good.
In an era of rapid progress in information and communication technology, this should stimulate mutual interest and tolerance, eliminate extremes in approaches and judgements and promote the development of dialogue.
The right of each people to choose its own path of development must be fully guaranteed.
The heads of State are convinced that a rational and just world order must be based on the strengthening of mutual trust and good-neighbourliness and the establishment of relations of genuine partnership free from claims to monopoly and dominance in international affairs.
The more firmly such an order is based on the primacy of the principles and standards of international law, first and foremost, the Charter of the United Nations, the more stable and secure it will be.
In the field of human rights, there is a need for strict and consistent respect for the historical traditions and national specificities of each people and for the sovereign equality of all States.
The heads of State support rational and necessary reform of the United Nations to increase its effectiveness and authority.
It was reaffirmed that, in conducting the reform, it would be important to adhere to the principle of the broadest possible consensus and to refrain from imposing time frames or putting to the vote proposals on which there remained significant differences.
The heads of State are proceeding on the basis that the Asia and Pacific region is destined to play an important role in securing peace and development in the twenty-first century.
They oppose the development of fault lines, both in the region as a whole and in its constituent parts, and they believe that any misunderstandings or disputes between States must be resolved by peaceful means, that is through negotiation, and that an atmosphere of friendship, mutual understanding, cooperation and constructiveness must become firmly established in this dynamic region.
Promoting this is one of the main areas of activity of SCO.
The heads of State support the efforts of the Central Asian States to maintain peace, security and stability in their countries and in the region as a whole and believe that SCO should play an active role in strengthening stability and economic development in Central Asia.
The heads of State believe that concerted efforts by the member States are required in order to effectively counter the new challenges and threats to international and regional security and stability.
Such concerted efforts must be of a multidisciplinary nature, must make a tangible contribution to the reliable protection of the territories, populations and key life-support systems and infrastructure facilities of the member States from the destructive impact of the new challenges and threats and to the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable development and poverty eradication in the SCO area and must include:
- Development of close cooperation among the member States' foreign policy and foreign economic departments, law enforcement agencies, special services and defence departments;
- Active use of the mechanism of meetings of the Secretaries of the member States' Security Councils;
- Elaboration of effective measures and mechanisms for responding jointly to situations that pose a threat to peace, security and stability in the region;
- Joint planning and conduct of counter-terrorism measures;
- Harmonization of national legislation on security issues;
- Cooperation in developing and utilizing modern technology to combat new challenges and threats;
- Establishment of an effective information mechanism to counter the new challenges and threats;
- Training of specialists in relevant fields.
The States members of SCO will suppress attempts in their territories to plan or commit terrorist acts, including acts directed against the interests of other States, they will not grant asylum to persons accused or suspected of conducting terrorist, separatist or extremist activities and they will extradite such persons on receiving applications to that effect from other member States formulated in strict compliance with the legislation in force in those States.
Measures will be taken to improve and increase the effectiveness of the work of the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure.
It is important for SCO, within the framework of efforts to combat international terrorism, to tackle the problem of eliminating its material base, first and foremost, by combating the illicit traffic in weapons, ammunition, explosives and narcotic drugs, organized transborder crime, illegal migration and mercenarism.
Special attention must be given to preventing the use by terrorists of components of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery and information terrorism.
In order to combat the financing of terrorism, separatism and extremism, including the legalization of income and funds obtained by illegal means, there is an urgent need to develop within SCO common approaches and standards for monitoring money transfers and movements of funds belonging to individuals and entities suspected of participation in terrorism and to ensure that SCO is actively involved in relevant international efforts.
Priority attention must be given to expanding cooperation in combating the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and their precursors, in accordance with the Agreement on Cooperation against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and Their Precursors of 17 June 2004.
SCO is ready to take an active part in international efforts to establish an anti-drug belt around Afghanistan and in the development and implementation of special programmes to provide assistance to Afghanistan in stabilizing its socio-economic and humanitarian situation.
We support and will continue to support the efforts of the international coalition conducting counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan.
Today, we note the positive trend towards stabilization of the internal political situation in Afghanistan.
A number of SCO countries made their ground infrastructure available for the temporary accommodation of the coalition members' military contingents and granted the use of their territories and airspace for military transit to facilitate counter-terrorism operations.
In the light of the completion of the active military phase of counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan, the States members of SCO believe that the participants in the anti-terrorism coalition should establish end dates for their temporary use of the aforementioned infrastructure facilities and the presence of their military contingents in the territories of the SCO countries.
The protection and development of key infrastructure and transport facilities are becoming ever more urgent given the need to prevent and deal with various types of man-made disasters, the consequences of which are already emerging as a significant element in the new order of threats.
The States members of SCO are developing multilateral mechanisms for monitoring and exchanging analytical information concerning potential disasters and their consequences and are establishing the necessary legal and organizational conditions for the conduct of joint rescue operations, including preparation and training of personnel in the use of common methods, rapid transfer of personnel and compatibility of technical equipment.
SCO will make a constructive contribution to the efforts of the world community to address security issues on land, at sea, in the air and in outer space.
In order to increase their capacity to combat terrorism, separatism, extremism and other challenges and threats, the States members of SCO will consistently expand cooperation in the economic sphere, guided by the Programme on multilateral trade and economic cooperation and the Plan of Measures to give effect to the Programme.
Practical steps will be taken in the fields of environmental protection and rational use of natural resources.
There is an urgent need to develop agreed methods and recommendations for conducting preventive measures and appropriate public awareness activities in order to counter attempts to exert a destructive influence on public opinion.
The member States will actively promote the expansion of cooperation within SCO in such areas as education, culture, sport and tourism.
The heads of State are proceeding on the basis that combining their efforts within the framework of SCO for the purpose of safeguarding security and expanding the Organization's potential does not infringe on the interests of other countries or signify a movement towards the establishment of a bloc and that it is fully consistent with the principle of openness of SCO and with the spirit of broad international cooperation in confronting new challenges and threats.
