Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Financing of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire
Proposed budget for the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 and expenditure report for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
Introduction
The recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in paragraphs below would entail a reduction of $4,225,600 in the proposed budget for the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 (see A/59/750).
The Committee also makes a number of observations and recommendations with regard to the administration and management of the Mission and opportunities for further savings.
The general report of the Advisory Committee on the United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/59/736) contains its views and recommendations on a number of cross-cutting issues.
In the paragraphs below, the Committee deals with resources and other items that relate specifically to UNOCI.
The documents used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the financing of UNOCI are listed at the end of the present report.
Expenditure report for the period from 4 April 2004 to 30 June 2004
On the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, the General Assembly, in its resolution 58/310, appropriated $96,368,100 gross ($95,601,200 net) for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004 for the establishment of the mission, inclusive of the amount of $49,943,300 previously authorized by the Committee under the terms of section IV of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994.
This amount has been assessed on Member States.
Expenditure for the period totalled $83,063,200 gross ($82,515,900) (see A/59/750, sect.
The resulting unencumbered balance of $13,304,900 gross ($13,085,300 net) reflects a budget implementation rate of 86.2 per cent, representing an overall underexpenditure of $7,661,600 (20.7 per cent) under military and police personnel, $1,533,100 (23.5 per cent) under civilian personnel and $4,110,200 (7.8 per cent) under operational costs.
Under military and police personnel, the Advisory Committee notes that, apart from military observers, who could be fully deployed during this period with an average strength of 126 versus the 121 planned, the average vacancy rate for military contingents and civilian police was 13.4 and 65.9 per cent, respectively, due to the delay in identifying appropriate troop-contributing countries, which led to their late deployment.
Details of the steps undertaken by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to address this issue, which was also raised by the Committee in its last report (A/59/419, para.
21) are given in section VI, paragraph 2, of the budget document (A/59/750).
Concerning civilian personnel, the average vacancy rate for international staff, national staff and United Nations Volunteers was 32.8, 44.6 and 80.2 per cent, respectively.
These high vacancy rates were attributable to the mission's inadequate infrastructure and lack of capacity for handling the recruitment process, as well as to competition for French-speaking candidates from other United Nations peacekeeping operations, in particular the high recruitment activity related to the expansion of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and the start-up of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and the United Nations Operation in Burundi (UNOB) during the same period.
Concerning United Nations Volunteers, the high vacancy rates are due to the fact that the recruitment of 120 electoral workers has been delayed until political decisions on the holding of the October 2005 elections are made.
The savings realized under operational costs were attributable to:
(a) Lower than budgeted expenditure for official travel and training;
(b) Limited capacity of the procurement section to complete the procurement process for communications, information technology and observation equipment;
(c) Long lead procurement times and delays in the delivery of a variety of equipment such as office furniture, medical supplies, security and safety equipment by both local contractors and through United Nations system contracts;
(d) Reduced requirements for alteration, renovation and construction services owing to delays in identifying suitable premises for establishment of accommodation and office facilities at certain locations;
(e) Deployment of fewer than projected vehicles resulting in lower costs for petrol, oil and lubricants;
(f) Limited implementation of quick impact projects owing to the short time for the identification and approval of such projects;
(g) Delayed deployment of air assets with the actual deployment of two aircraft (1 helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft) instead of the six aircraft anticipated.
The Advisory Committee was informed that some of the delays were caused by the depletion of strategic deployment stocks at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, due to the high demand from a number of missions that were in the start-up or expansion phases at the same time.
The Committee notes that in most instances the savings were realized as a result of delays during the start-up phase and constitute expenditure that will spill over to the next period.
These savings were partly offset by higher than planned expenditure for the transportation of United Nations-owned equipment, a 14-day rations reserve transferred from the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), the expedited acquisition of vehicles and workshop equipment and the acquisition of additional generators and hardwall modular buildings and semi-hardwall structures for accommodation and office facilities pending identification and contracting of suitable premises.
The Advisory Committee was informed that despite the delays during the start-up period, UNOCI was able to re-hat and deploy some 3,000 Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) troops on 4 April 2004 along the Zone of Confidence, finalize memorandums of understanding with the former ECOWAS contingents, put contingent-owned equipment procedures in place and complete contingent-owned equipment inspections.
In these activities, UNOCI received assistance, equipment and goods from the neighbouring United Nations missions, namely the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and MONUC.
Details of the assistance provided during the start-up phase as well as ongoing cooperation between the United Nations missions are provided below, in paragraphs 67 and 68.
The comments of the Advisory Committee on the information in the expenditure report on individual objects of expenditure can be found, where relevant, in the discussion of the proposed budget for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 in section IV below.
Information on performance for the current period
This year, owing to various constraints, rather than including standard statistical data on performance for the current period in each of the individual peacekeeping reports, it has been necessary to supply this type of information in consolidated tables, which are annexed to the Advisory Committee's general report on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736).
The information to be provided covers the following: (a) expenditure for the current period; (b) current incumbency; (c) status of reimbursement for troop/formed police costs, contingent-owned equipment and death and disability; (d) cash position of the missions; and (e) status of contributions.
The Advisory Committee was informed that UNOCI had achieved full deployment of troops at 40 locations, with 2,787 troops deployed in Sector East, 2,102 troops in Sector West and 956 troops, including 120 staff officers at the force headquarters in Abidjan.
The 3 per cent shortfall under military contingents concerns crew and support personnel for one aviation unit of 8 military helicopters, which is not yet deployed.
UNOCI is holding a series of discussions with potential troop-contributing countries, but has not yet been able to identify an aviation unit with the required capabilities in terms of flexibility and capacity for moving troops rapidly in a hostile environment.
Until an acceptable arrangement can be reached, some of these services will have to be procured though commercial providers.
Concerning civilian staff, the Advisory Committee was informed that the lack of improvement in vacancy rates was largely a consequence of the crisis of November 2004 and the subsequent successive changes of the security level from Phase 2, to Phase 3 and Phase 5 in Abidjan.
These changes led to the evacuation of 218 international non-essential staff from Mission and Sector headquarters and the suspension of work, including recruitment activities, for almost 70 days, until 10 January 2005.
In view of the inability of newly recruited personnel to join UNOCI until the security situation had improved, and taking into account the time required to get all the offices back into full operation, the recruitment campaign was set back by three months.
This delay had a consequent impact on procurement activity and other key projects.
The comments of the Advisory Committee on the information on individual objects of expenditure can be found, where relevant, in the discussion of the proposed budget for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 in the paragraphs below.
Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006
Mandate and planned results
UNOCI was established by Security Council resolution 1528 (2004) for an initial period of 12-months from 4 April 2004, at which date the Secretary-General was requested to transfer authority from the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire (MINUCI) and the forces of ECOWAS to UNOCI.
The mission was initially mandated to monitor the ceasefire, assist in the improvement of the law and order situation, protect civilian rights, assist in the improvement of humanitarian and human rights conditions and ensure the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement process.
Subsequently, the mandate of UNOCI was further expanded by Security Council resolutions 1572 (2004) and 1584 (2005) to include the additional responsibility of monitoring the arms embargo on Côte d'Ivoire and to play a much wider role in bringing peace and stability to the country.
The representatives of the Secretary-General briefed the Advisory Committee on the current context and status of the operation following the events of November 2004.
The security level has been lowered from Phase V to Phase III by the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator, but the safety and security of United Nations staff and installations remain a cause of concern.
There is an increased crime rate against United Nations and mission personnel and a growing negative sentiment with regard to the United Nations.
The open movement of armed militia groups, the lack of law and order and the increasing tension between Government and rebel forces continue to hamper the smooth operation of UNOCI and progress in all the areas of the mission's mandate, including rule of law, human rights and the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.
Furthermore, the Independent Electoral Commission, which is the principal national body responsible for organizing and managing the elections, has been temporarily suspended.
A significant number of technical tasks, such as the updating of electoral lists are yet to be completed and the time remaining for the proper organization of the election is rapidly running out, putting the idea of holding elections in October 2005 in jeopardy.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the ability of UNOCI to implement some of the components of its mandate depends on the achievement of a peace agreement and that, in this regard, much of the focus was on the mediation initiative of the African Union led by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, which began on 9 November 2004.
The Committee was informed that little progress had been made until the latest talks held in Pretoria at the beginning of April 2005, at which positive results were achieved, namely the signing of the Pretoria Agreement by the Ivorian parties on 6 April 2005.
The agreement envisages a role for the United Nations in several areas, including the disarmament process, the dismantling and disarmament of militias, the organization of elections and the training of security auxiliaries in the north.
The Security Council will be briefed on developments in late April 2005.
This will provide an opportunity for discussions on the implementation of the Pretoria Agreement and a clarification on the proposed role of the United Nations.
UNOCI plans to complete deployment of its administrative and logistics resources to four major locations in addition to its the headquarters in Abidjan.
Following the events of November 2004, the renovation of the integrated mission headquarters at the Sebroko Hotel in Abidjan was suspended for 3 months.
It is now planned to be completed by July 2005.
To support the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, UNOCI plans to deploy both manpower and material resources to 11 identified regrouping sites, of which six are located in areas controlled by Government forces and five in territory held by the Forces Nouvelles.
The overall budget for the programme is estimated at $150 million for the period from 2005 to 2008.
It is envisaged that the programme will be funded through contributions from the World Bank ($85 million), the Government of Côte d'Ivoire ($30 million) and UNDP ($15 million), with the remaining $20 million to be raised from international donors, as yet to be identified, through the efforts of the National Commission on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration.
The Advisory Committee discusses the funding of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes in its general report on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736).
The Advisory Committee has already expressed its appreciation for the well-defined, detailed and transparent results-based framework of UNOCI in its previous reports (A/58/806 and A/59/419), and once again commends the mission for a clear, informative presentation of its expected accomplishments and related outputs in each area of its mandate.
It points out, however, that in certain cases the expected accomplishments would seem to represent a high-level goal rather than an achievable accomplishment within the time frame of the proposed budget.
The Advisory Committee recommends that careful thought be given to the formulation of expected accomplishments and stresses the importance of the involvement of and guidance from the most senior levels of UNOCI in the formulation of strategic objectives as well as the budget preparation process.
Resource requirements
Military and police personnel
a Excluding the civilian police commissioner and four police officers recruited under international civilian contracts.
The total cost estimate for military and civilian police for 2005/06 is $166,403,800, an increase of $5,145,000 (3.2 per cent) in comparison with the apportionment for the current period.
The estimated requirement of $9,963,600 for military observers reflects an increase of $1,054,200 (11.8 per cent) and is based on the full deployment of the authorized strength of 200 military observers, taking into account a 3 per cent turnover factor for mission subsistence allowance (MSA) compared to a 10 per cent delayed deployment factor applied in 2004/05.
The Advisory Committee notes, however, that the actual delayed deployment rate as at 28 February 2005 was 14.5 per cent.
The cost estimate for military contingents amounts to $141,117,900, an increase of $1,569,600 (1.1 per cent) over the apportionment for the current period.
The increase is mainly due to the projected full deployment with the application of a 3 per cent turnover factor and to the meal portion of MSA for gendarmes funded from this component, compared to the 5 per cent delayed deployment rate applied for the previous period.
An increase of $2,521,200 (19.7 per cent) over the apportionment for the current period is requested for civilian police.
The main factor contributing to this variance is the projected full deployment of the mission's authorized strength of 345 police personnel (excluding the civilian police commissioner and four police officers for which provision is made under the international staff category).
A 15 per cent delayed deployment factor has been applied for the computation of MSA.
The Advisory Committee takes note of the difficulties the mission is encountering in recruiting French-speaking personnel and that, as at 28 February 2005, 37.1 per cent of the authorized complement of civilian police was not yet on board.
With respect to the hardwall accommodations for troops, the Advisory Committee was informed that the construction of these facilities was also delayed due to the events of November 2004.
The facilities are becoming available and the troops will start moving into their new accommodations shortly.
The entire transfer is scheduled to be completed over a six-month period.
At present, staff officers are housed in hotel accommodations provided by the United Nations.
They will also be moved as the new facilities become available.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the aviation transport unit, including eight military helicopters and support personnel, has still not been deployed and that a troop-contributing country has still to be identified.
The Committee notes that the situation has not progressed since October 2004 when it considered the budget proposals for 2004/05.
At that time, the Committee had noted that the deployment of this unit was budgeted for 1 October 2004.
Civilian personnel
a Excludes 3 international and one national staff for the office of the Resident Auditor, Office of Internal Oversight Services, to be funded from the Support Account for Peacekeeping Operations from 1 July 2005.
b Includes national officers.
c Includes 120 vacant electoral posts, pending a decision on the elections of October 2005.
An overall increase of $17,559,600 (34.6 per cent) in comparison with the apportionment for the current period is proposed under civilian personnel for the 2005/06 period, using the same vacancy rates applied for the current period.
However, the Advisory Committee notes that the actual vacancy rates as at 28 February 2005 for international staff, national staff and United Nations Volunteers (30.7, 26.3 and 60.9 per cent, respectively) remain considerably higher than the rates used to determine the cost estimates (20, 15 and 20 per cent, respectively).
The estimated requirements for international staff amount to $51,716,500, an increase of $14,095,500 (37.5 per cent) over the apportionment for the current period, based on a vacancy factor of 20 per cent and the actual average salary and staff assessment expenditure for the 2003/04 period across all peacekeeping missions (excluding the United Nations Logistics Base and established missions) since the actual mission-specific average expenditure is not yet available as UNOCI was established only in April 2004.
The main factors contributing to the variance are the projected deployment of all approved international staff for 2004/05 (compared to their phased deployment during the current period) as well as a provision for the proposed additional 41 posts, based on their phased deployment.
Common staff costs have been estimated at 83 per cent of the net salary, including provision for hazardous duty station allowance.
Concerning national staff, the estimated requirements amount to $9,726,000, an increase of $2,095,900 (27.5 per cent) over the current period, based on a turnover factor of 15 per cent, G-4, step VI, and National Officer (NO)-B, step V, salaries and staff assessment and common staff costs of the national staff salary scales in effect from 1 June 2002.
The variance is due to the projected deployment of all national staff approved for the 2004/05 period (compared to their phased deployment during that period) combined with the provision for 70 additional staff based on their deployment in January 2006.
With regard to United Nations Volunteers, the estimated requirement amounts to $6,834,600, representing an increase of $1,368,200 (25 per cent) over the current period and based on a turnover factor of 20 per cent.
The variance is due to the projected deployment of all United Nations Volunteers approved for 2004/05 (compared to their phased deployment during that period) combined with the provision for 10 additional proposed Volunteers based on their deployment in January 2006.
Recommendations on posts
The Advisory Committee notes with appreciation that UNOCI has made a serious effort to address the recommendations on posts made in its previous report (A/59/419 and Corr.1) and that the review of the functions of the posts identified for re-justification (General Assembly resolution 59/16) has led to proposals for the downgrading and abolition of certain posts.
The Committee encourages UNOCI to undertake this type of review as an ongoing exercise and to adapt and determine the level of posts whenever possible according to changing operational requirements as well as the actual responsibilities and functions performed, exploring the potential for integrating some of the functions in order to ensure the most cost-effective use of resources.
(a) Executive direction and management
Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for humanitarian coordination, recovery and reconstruction, Assistant Secretary-General (re-justification of authorized post).
UNOCI proposes to maintain this position at the Assistant Secretary-General level rather than downgrading it to the D-2 level.
The Advisory Committee notes that the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General also acts as UNDP resident representative and is the designated official responsible for the security arrangements concerning the staff of all the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes in Côte d'Ivoire.
The Committee further notes that the arrangement discussed between UNDP and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for the shared funding of posts of Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General who also function as UNDP resident coordinators, whereby UNDP would usually provide funds up to the D-2 level and the United Nations would supplement the additional requirement for the Assistant Secretary-General level, is not yet operational.
At present, the United Nations provides the entire salary, benefits and allowances for the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the mission.
Given the role of the Deputy Special Representative, the Committee sees no reason why the arrangement discussed with UNDP would not be applied to all missions concerned, irrespective of what level is eventually determined for such a post.
It expects that an undertaking that UNDP would fund this post up to the D-2 level will be confirmed and put into practice without further delay and requests that it be informed accordingly before the submission of the 2006/07 budget.
The Committee also discusses this matter in its general report (A/59/736).
On the basis of a further elaboration of the responsibilities of this post, the Committee accepts the reasons for the re-justification of this post at the Assistant Secretary-General level.
Director in the office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the D-1 level (re-justification of authorized post).
After further review of the responsibilities of this post, UNOCI proposes to maintain it at the D-1 level.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Principal Legal Officer at the D-1 level (re-justification of authorized post).
Upon further review of the responsibilities of this position, and in accordance with the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, UNOCI proposes to downgrade this position to the P-5 level.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Special Assistant to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the P-5 level (re-justification of authorized post).
Upon further review of the responsibilities of this position and in accordance with the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, UNOCI proposes to abolish this position and redistribute its functions between the Director of the office and his/her Special Assistant.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Two Protocol Officers, 1 P-2, 1 National Officer (re-justification of authorized post/new post).
Upon further review of the responsibilities and functions of these positions, and taking into account the extensive knowledge of local customs and traditions required for this position, UNOCI considers that a National Officer post rather than an international post would be more suitable.
UNOCI proposes to create a new National Officer post for Protocol Officer and to redeploy the Protocol Officer, P-2 post to the Political Affairs Office as Associate Political Officer.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
(b) Human Rights Office
The Advisory Committee was informed that UNOCI plans to expand its human rights field presence in the northern part of the country, with the number of field offices to be increased from four to eight, and to reinvigorate the investigation, documentation, monitoring and reporting on human rights violations.
The Operation also plans to place greater emphasis on raising human rights awareness in society at large, strengthening the human rights capacity of the Government and of local non-governmental organizations.
This necessitates a wider geographical presence throughout the country.
Upon request the Committee was provided with the distribution of international and national human rights staff across the regional offices.
Three Human Rights Officers, P-3 (new posts).
UNOCI proposes the establishment of three P-3 posts for deployment in field offices in order to strengthen its human rights investigation, monitoring and reporting capacity.
The Advisory Committee has no objection to this proposal.
The following national staff are requested for the Human Rights Office:
(a) Two Human Rights Officers, National Officers (new posts);
(b) Four Administrative Assistants, national General Service (new posts);
(c) Six Drivers/Language Assistants, national General Service (new posts).
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
(c) Political Affairs Office
Two Political Affairs Officers, P-3 (new posts), and one Associate Political Affairs Officer, P-2 (Associate Political Affairs Officer redeployed from the office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, ex-Protocol Officer).
UNOCI proposes the establishment of these posts to strengthen the analytical and monitoring capacity of its Political Affairs Office as part of the peace process as well as to carry out the additional reporting requirements on the monitoring of the ceasefire.
The Operation has also been mandated by Security Council resolution 1584 (2005) to provide a political perspective, including its regional dimension on the implementation of the arms embargo measures.
One of the P-3 Political Affairs Officers is to be deployed in the field, to Daloa.
The other Political Affairs Officer and the Associate Political Affairs Officer will be stationed at the headquarters office in Abidjan.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
(d) Electoral Assistance Office
Two Regional Electoral Officers, P-3 (new posts), and two Regional Electoral Officers, P-2 (new posts).
UNOCI proposes the establishment of these posts to provide advice and assistance to the local national identification and electoral bodies as well as to supervise and coordinate the 120 Electoral Officers (United Nations Volunteers) to be deployed to the field.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the deployment of these officers and the 120 United Nations Volunteers to the field would be initiated once a decision on the holding of elections in October 2005 was known.
These proposals are based on an assessment of the requirements for the elections in Côte d'Ivoire conducted by the Electoral Assistance Division at Headquarters in New York.
The Advisory Committee notes that even though the titles of the posts requested are “Regional” Electoral Officers, it is planned to deploy one of the P-3 officers to headquarters.
Furthermore, there is very little information provided on the organization of the elections, their cost and the role of the Operation.
The Committee trusts that more complete information on the role and activities of these officers will be provided in the next budget submission.
Despite the current uncertainty surrounding the holding of the elections, in the light of the latest developments (see para.
20 above), the Advisory Committee does not object to this proposal.
(e) Communications and public information
The Advisory Committee was informed that a public outreach campaign aimed at creating a climate conducive to peace and countering disinformation and hate media had been launched by UNOCI to support the peace process.
The UNOCI FM radio station, which was launched in August 2004 and is now broadcasting to almost the entire country, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, plays a key role in this campaign, as well as in addressing widespread public misperceptions regarding the role of UNOCI.
The Operation intends to intensify its nationwide, multimedia public information and advocacy programme in support of the peace process as well as its monitoring and analysis of daily media.
Chief of the Communications and Public Information Office, D-1 (Re-justification of post).
The functions of this post have been reviewed by UNOCI in the light of the remarks of the Advisory Committee in its previous report (A/59/419 and Corr.1).
A detailed description of its functions is provided in paragraph 10 (a) of the budget report (A/59/750).
UNOCI proposes to maintain the post at the D-1 level.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Spokesperson, P-5 (Re-justification of post).
The functions of this post have been reviewed by UNOCI in light of the remarks of the Advisory Committee in its previous report (A/59/419 and Corr.1).
A detailed description of its functions is provided in paragraph 10 (b) of the budget report (A/59/750).
UNOCI proposes to downgrade this post from the P-5 to the P-4 level.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Two Regional Public Information Officers, P-3 (new posts).
These posts are requested by UNOCI for Sectors East and West in order to enhance the capacity of the Communication and Public Information Office to monitor and analyse audio-visual, print and other media and to reinforce outreach activities in the field.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
The following national General Service staff are proposed for the Communication and Public Information Office:
(a) Four Public Information Assistants (Reporter) (new posts);
(b) Two Radio Technicians (new posts);
(c) One Clerk/Driver (new post).
These national staff posts are requested to strengthen the public information capacity in Sectors East and West to report on the Operation's mandate and activities in national languages and to augment the capacity of radio UNOCI in the field.
These additional resources are requested to support a nationwide multimedia public information and advocacy programme in support of the political process and the expansion of public information activities to throughout the country.
The Advisory Committee commends UNOCI on the addition of national staff posts in this office and emphasizes the importance of strengthening the capacity and role of national staff.
The Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
(f) Support component
The Advisory Committee notes that a total of 91 new posts are requested under this component, including 1 in the office of the Chief Administrative Officer, 20 under administrative services, 27 under integrated support services and 43 in the Security Section.
The Committee was informed that the increased requirements are mainly due to the ongoing mission start-up activities that were postponed due to the events of November 2004, including renovation/construction of facilities, procurement of equipment, establishment of field offices and recruitment and placement of personnel.
The mission headquarters building is due to be completed in July 2005.
It is expected that the transfer of all personnel to the new facilities will take place over a 6-month period.
The Advisory Committee anticipates a reduction of the support component costs after completion of the construction and transfer to the new headquarters, with emphasis shifting from start-up activities and costs to the maintenance of the facilities.
At the same time, the Committee was informed by UNOCI that there may be an operational requirement to open several new sites for troops that will minimize expected savings in this regard.
The Committee had extensive discussions with the representatives of the Secretary-General on the necessity of utilizing national staff as a priority whenever possible and establishing a strategy for gradually replacing international staff with national staff as the Operation evolves from the start-up phase to an established mission.
Office of the Chief Administrative Officer
One Budget Assistant, national General Service staff (new post).
This post is requested to enhance the budget monitoring and implementation capacity of the Budget Unit.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Administrative services
Finance Section (2 new posts)
Two Finance Assistants, United Nations Volunteers (new posts).
These posts are requested to strengthen the payroll and vendor payment units in view of the full deployment of the military personnel and civilian police.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Procurement Section (8 new posts)
The following posts are proposed for the Procurement Section:
(a) Three Procurement Assistants, Field Service (new posts);
(b) Three Procurement Assistants, national General Service staff (new posts);
(c) Two Procurement Assistants, United Nations Volunteers (new posts).
The eight procurement assistants are requested to strengthen the procurement section during the ongoing construction of the integrated mission headquarters, requiring the establishment of over 20 complex engineering contracts.
The Advisory Committee notes that while there is a backlog in purchase orders, engineering work is being progressively phased out since the new headquarters building is due to be ready by July 2005.
Furthermore, contract management should be carried out in close cooperation with the engineering section.
The Committee does not see the need for three procurement assistants at the Field Service level.
Taking this into account, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of posts for one Procurement Assistant (Field Service) three Procurement Assistants (national General Service staff) and two Procurement Assistants (United Nations Volunteers).
General Services Section (10 new posts, 2 redeployed posts)
The following posts are proposed for the General Services Section:
(a) One Disposal Officer, Field Service (new post);
(b) Two Disposal Assistants, 1 national General Service, and 1 United Nations Volunteer (new posts);
(c) Two Facilities Management Supervisors, United Nations Volunteers (new posts);
(d) Five Facilities Management Assistants, national General Service (new posts);
(e) Two Shipping Assistants, 1 Field Service and 1 national General Service (to be redeployed to the Movement Control Section).
These posts are requested to streamline the disposal of written-off assets, inventory and facilities management and to improve the control of cargo movements.
Two Shipping Assistants, 1 Field Service and 1 national General Service staff are to be redeployed to the Movement Control Section.
The net addition to the General Services Section would be eight.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Integrated Support Services
Joint Logistics Operations Centre (1 new post)
One Logistics Assistant, United Nations Volunteer (new post).
This post is requested in connection with the projected full deployment of military contingent personnel and the expansion of the Operation's presence in the interior of the country and for all operational issues related to the accommodation of military and civilian personnel.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Supply Section (2 new posts)
One Food Quality Control Assistant, Field Service (new post), and one Fuel Contracts Assistant, Field Service (new post).
These posts are requested for monitoring the rations and fuel contracts and the contractor's performance and to ensure compliance with the contractual agreements.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Engineering Section (22 new posts)
The following posts are requested for the Engineering Section:
(a) Two air conditioning mechanics, United Nations Volunteers (new posts);
(b) Two generator mechanics, national General Service (new posts);
(c) Thirteen air conditioning mechanics, national General Service (new posts);
(d) Two electricians, national General Service (new posts);
(e) Three plumbers, national General Service (new posts).
These posts are requested to support the implementation of construction projects and for work related to the maintenance of additional and expanded facilities, including the integrated mission headquarters, office and living accommodations at 71 locations and modular hardwall buildings for military contingents.
The Committee expects that some of the current workload will be phased out as the renovation/construction work of the new headquarters is completed.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Movement Control Section (2 redeployed posts)
Two Shipping Assistants, 1 Field Service, and 1 national General Service (redeployed from General Services Section).
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Transport Section (2 new posts)
One Dispatcher, Field Service (new post), and one Stores Assistant, national General Service (new post).
These posts are requested to support the deployment of the large fleet (289) of United Nations-owned vehicles to the Sectors.
Although not recommending a reduction, the Advisory Committee requests UNOCI to consider filling the post of dispatcher at the national General Service staff level rather than Field Service.
(g) Security Section
The following 24 international and 19 national General Service posts are requested for the Security Section:
(a) Three Security Plans Officers, 1 P-2, 2 Field Service (new posts);
(b) Two Security Training Officers, Field Service (new posts);
(c) Ten Security Officers, Field Service (new posts);
(d) Six Radio Operators, General Service (Other level) (new posts);
(e) Three Administrative assistants, General Service (Other level) (new post);
(f) Nineteen national General Service staff, including Guard Shift Supervisors and Air Security Assistants (new posts).
These posts are requested to enhance security arrangements throughout the mission area.
In view of the prevailing security situation in the country, it is proposed to establish a Plans and Liaison Unit and a Training Unit.
The Radio Operator posts are required to enable the mission to operate its Emergency Communications System (ECS) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
For reasons of operational safety and in view of the sensitive and confidential information channelled through the Emergency Communications System, these functions should be performed by international staff (see also para.
66 below).
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Operational costs
Training
The Advisory Committee notes that the total training budget amounts to $766,800, including $56,200 for training consultants, $611,100 for travel and $99,500 for training fees, supplies and services.
Details of the training programmes envisaged for the 2005/06 period in supplementary information provided by UNOCI show that since a considerable number of courses attended are outside the mission area, they involve a great deal of travel.
The Committee was informed that during the start-up phase, there was a need for “train the trainer” type of courses, as well as certification courses that must be attended in person.
It is anticipated that as the mission becomes established, the number of “outside-the-mission” certification courses will be reduced.
The primary focus of the training programmes developed at UNOCI is to strengthen the technical capacity of mission staff in areas such as budget and finance, procurement, supply, air operations, engineering, transport, information technology, security, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and HIV/AIDS awareness, as well as communication and language skills in English and French.
Communications/public information
The Advisory Committee notes that the budget proposals for the 2005/06 period include a provision of some $2.8 million under public information, including $1,832,100 for public information services.
Information provided to the Committee indicates the use of a considerable number of consultants.
The Committee understands the reasons for this, but trusts that, as knowledge and expertise are transferred, the need for such expenditure will diminish.
Official travel
The Advisory Committee had an extensive exchange of views with the representatives of the Secretary-General on this matter.
The Committee reiterates that it is important that UNOCI staff visiting Headquarters optimize their trip by combining a variety of purposes and that those individuals travelling from Headquarters combine visits to different missions in the same subregion during the same trip.
The Advisory Committee is of the view that cost-sharing should be applied and the results systematically reported in performance reports.
Ground transport
With respect to ground transport, the Advisory Committee is concerned by both the high number of representation vehicles in the Operation as well as the variety of makes.
The Committee requests UNOCI to standardize the Operation's fleet as far as possible in order to lower the costs of maintenance and spare parts, and to monitor the composition of its fleet.
This matter is discussed more extensively in the Committee's general report on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736).
Security
The Advisory Committee notes that the overall security situation in all regions of the country is precarious and may present a challenge to the smooth operation of UNOCI as well as in the achievement of its objectives.
The Committee was informed that the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator had taken part in the initial assessment mission and had coordinated the determination of the security requirements for the mission.
Security procedures and enhancements, such as the Emergency Communications System within the Security Operation Centre, have been put into place in close cooperation with the Office of the Security Coordinator and will serve as a model to be applied to other United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The centre is operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
To strengthen its security arrangements, UNOCI has requested an additional 24 international and 19 national staff posts (see para.
61 above).
The Committee further notes that the cost estimates of security services for 2005/06 amount to $999,000, an increase of $639,000 (177.5 per cent).
The variance is due to the increased requirement for security guards, from 200 for 2004/05 to 555 for 2005/06.
These guards provide perimeter security services at United Nations installations in Abidjan and 71 other locations, based on an existing contract with a security company in Abidjan.
This arrangement allows UNOCI to maintain flexible terms for adjusting the number of security guards according to the severity of the security situation on the ground.
C. Inter-mission cooperation
The Advisory Committee was informed that there was active cooperation with MONUC and the other missions in the region, namely UNMIL and UNAMSIL, especially at the start-up phase and during the events of November 2004.
UNOCI received equipment (vehicles, prefabricated buildings, communications equipment, medical equipment), personnel (contingent-owned equipment inspectors, fire marshals, procurement officers, security officers) and air support.
In the area of procurement, UNOCI was able to share information on its scope of work, contracts and market data, including vendor databases and invitee lists to meet numerous requirements, such as security equipment and the turnkey fuel contract.
The exchange of equipment and goods is coordinated with the Logistics Support Division at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations through liaison officers in each mission.
Given that cooperation and the sharing of assets between the missions of the region seem to be working properly, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations does not envisage the creation of a regional supply facility, which is not deemed to be cost-effective at this point.
The Advisory Committee was also informed that UNOCI, UNAMSIL and UNMIL routinely share information on political and security developments.
The Special Representatives of the Secretary-General of these missions as well as the Representative of the Secretary-General for Guinea-Bissau meet regularly under the aegis of the United Nations Office for West Africa (UNOWA).
Links between the force headquarters of the three missions at various levels have been established, including the exchange of liaison officers, cross-border inter-mission meetings between sector and unit commanders and military observers.
Meetings between the force commanders are held on a regular basis and an inter-mission secretariat has been established to coordinate both these meetings and follow-up actions.
Quick impact projects
Quick impact projects form part of a strategy aimed at improving the relationship between peacekeepers and civilians.
The Advisory Committee was informed that UNOCI plans to implement 100 quick impact projects during the 2005/06 period at a total cost estimate of $1 million.
Supplementary information provided by the mission shows that the projects will be in the areas of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (6 projects), public utilities (14 projects), gender (5 projects), education (33 projects), health (19 projects), HIV/AIDS (13 projects) and the media (10 projects).
During the current period, a total of 62 projects at a cost of $688,305 are under implementation.
Conclusion
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNOCI for the period from 4 April 2003 to 30 June 2004 is indicated in paragraphs 56 (c) and (d) of the proposed budget and expenditure report (A/59/750).
The Advisory Committee, in paragraphs 26, 28, 30, 31, 54, 64 and 65 above, has made observations and recommendations that should lead to economies.
Bearing in mind the fact that the Secretary-General has authority to administer the budget of the mission as a whole, reductions may be made either in the areas identified by the Committee or in others, as the situation may warrant.
Under the circumstances, the Committee if of the opinion that requirements for UNOCI for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 should not exceed $367,610,000.
This represents a reduction of $4,225,600 from the estimate proposed by the Secretary-General.
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNOCI for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 is indicated in paragraphs 55 (a) and (b) of the proposed budget (A/59/750).
In view of the comments above, the Advisory Committee recommends that the estimated budget requirement be reduced from $371,835,600 to $367,610,000.
