PROTOCOL ON THE POSITION OF DENMARK
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
RECALLING the decision of the Heads of State or Government, meeting within the European Council at Edinburgh on 12 December 1992, concerning certain problems raised by Denmark on the Treaty on European Union;
HAVING NOTED the position of Denmark with regard to citizenship, economic and monetary union, defence policy, and justice and home affairs as laid down in the Edinburgh decision;
CONSCIOUS of the fact that a continuation under the Constitution of the legal regime originating in the Edinburgh decision will significantly limit Denmark's participation in important areas of cooperation of the Union, and that it would be in the best interest of the Union to ensure the integrity of the acquis in the area of freedom, security and justice;
WISHING therefore to establish a legal framework that will provide an option for Denmark to participate in the adoption of measures proposed on the basis of Chapter IV of Title III of Part III of the Constitution and welcoming the intention of Denmark to avail itself of this option when possible in accordance with its constitutional requirements;
NOTING that Denmark will not prevent the other Member States from further developing their cooperation with respect to measures not binding on Denmark;
BEARING IN MIND the Protocol on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union,
HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Constitution:

For the purposes of this Article, a qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of the members of the Council representing the participating Member States, comprising at least 65 % of the population of these States.
A blocking minority must include at least the minimum number of Council members representing more than 35 % of the population of the participating Member States, plus one member, failing which the qualified majority shall be deemed attained.
By way of derogation from the second and third paragraphs, where the Council does not act on a proposal from the Commission or from the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, the required qualified majority shall be defined as at least 72 % of the members of the Council representing the participating Member States, comprising at least 65 % of the population of these States.

None of the provisions of Chapter IV of Title III of Part III of the Constitution, no measure adopted pursuant to that Chapter, no provision of any international agreement concluded by the Union pursuant to that Chapter, and no decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreting any such provision or measure shall be binding upon or applicable in Denmark; and no such provision, measure or decision shall in any way affect the competences, rights and obligations of Denmark; and no such provision, measure or decision shall in any way affect the Community or Union acquis nor form part of Union law as they apply to Denmark.
