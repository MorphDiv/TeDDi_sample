Fifty-ninth session
Agenda items 45 and 55
Integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields
Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit
Revised draft outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly of September 2005 submitted by the President of the General Assembly
Values and principles
We, Heads of State and Government, have gathered at United Nations Headquarters in New York from 14 to 16 September 2005.
We recognize the valuable role of all major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields, including the Millennium Summit, in mobilizing the international community at the local, national, regional and global levels and in guiding the work of the United Nations, and we reaffirm their outcomes and renew our commitment to fully implement them in an integrated and coordinated manner.
We recall the United Nations Millennium Declaration, which we adopted at the dawn of the twenty-first century, and reaffirm our faith in the Organization, our commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and our respect for international law.
We reaffirm that core values and principles, such as respect for human rights and human dignity, freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, the rule of law, shared responsibility, multilateralism and non-resort to the threat or use of force, are essential for peaceful coexistence and cooperation among States.
We rededicate ourselves to support all efforts to uphold the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, the resolution of disputes by peaceful means and the right of self-determination of peoples, including those that remain under colonial domination and foreign occupation.
We reaffirm the vital importance of an effective multilateral system, with a strong United Nations at its core, in order to better address the multifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats confronting our world and to achieve progress in the areas of development, security and human rights, and commit to spare no effort in promoting and strengthening the effectiveness of the Organization and the implementation of its decisions.
We believe that today, more than ever before, we live in a global and interdependent world.
No State can stand wholly alone.
We acknowledge that collective security depends on effective cooperation against transnational threats.
We recognize that we all share responsibility for each other's security.
We agree that current developments and circumstances require that we urgently build consensus on major threats and challenges.
We commit to translate that consensus into concrete action, including addressing the root causes of those threats and challenges.
We acknowledge that development, security and human rights form the indispensable foundations for collective security and well-being and that they are the pillars of the United Nations system.
We reaffirm that development is a central goal by itself and that sustainable development constitutes a key element of the overarching framework of United Nations activities, and we commit ourselves to fully implement the outcomes of all major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social, human rights, environmental and related fields, including the Millennium Development Goals.
We also acknowledge that good governance and the rule of law at the national and international levels are essential for sustained economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and hunger.
We reaffirm that gender equality and the promotion and protection of the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for women are essential to advance development, security and human rights.
We recognize that our nations and peoples will not enjoy development without security, nor will they enjoy security without development, and that they will not enjoy either without respect for human rights.
We reaffirm the universality and indivisibility of all human rights.
We recognize that all cultures and civilizations can contribute to the enrichment of humankind.
We acknowledge the importance of respect for and understanding of religious and cultural diversity throughout the world, especially through dialogue and cooperation, in promoting international peace and security and enhancing human welfare, freedom and progress everywhere, as well as the need to encourage dialogue, understanding, tolerance and respect among different cultures, civilizations and peoples as a means of promoting international peace and security.
We pledge to make the United Nations more effective, efficient, accountable and credible and to provide the Organization with the resources needed to fully implement its mandates.
This is our shared responsibility and our common interest.
We therefore resolve to undertake concrete measures with a view to ensuring effective follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit and the other major United Nations conferences and summits in the four following areas:
• Development
• Peace and collective security
• Human rights and the rule of law
• Strengthening of the United Nations
Development
We emphasize the critical role played by the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields in shaping a broad development vision and in identifying commonly agreed objectives, which have contributed to improving human life in different parts of the world.
We remain concerned, however, by the slow and uneven implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and reaffirm our commitment to eradicate poverty and promote sustained economic growth, sustainable development and global prosperity for all.
To this end we commit to promote the development of the productive sectors of developing countries in order to enable them to participate effectively in the increasingly open trading environment and thereby to take full advantage of the process of globalization.
Global partnership for development
We strongly reiterate our determination to ensure the timely and full realization of the development goals and objectives that have emerged from the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Development Goals, which have galvanized unprecedented efforts towards meeting the needs of the world's poorest.
We reaffirm our commitment to the global partnership for achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, based on mutual responsibility and accountability as agreed in Millennium Declaration and in 2002 at the International Conference on Financing for Development and the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
We further reaffirm our commitment to sound policies, good governance at all levels and the rule of law and to mobilize domestic resources, attract international capital flows, promote international trade as an engine for development, increase international financial and technical cooperation for development, sustainable debt financing and external debt relief and enhance the coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems.
We reaffirm that each country must take primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized.
To this end, we resolve to:
• Promote good governance at all levels, pursue sound macroeconomic policies and put in place policies and investments to drive sustained economic growth, stimulate the private sector and promote employment generation
• Promote the United Nations Convention against Corruption and fight corruption at all levels through policies that emphasize accountability, transparent public sector management and competitive markets
• Implement regulatory frameworks and commercial laws that encourage business formation and build public confidence in private markets through a clear definition of property rights, the protection of those rights, transparent rule-making, the enforcement of contracts and general respect for the rule of law
• Put into place policies to ensure adequate investment in health and education and the provision of public goods and social safety nets to protect vulnerable members of society
We recognize also that national efforts should be complemented by supportive global programmes, measures and policies aimed at maximizing the development opportunities of developing countries.
To these ends, we resolve to:
• Adopt, by 2006, and begin to implement comprehensive national development strategies to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including, by 2015, the Millennium Development Goals
• Effectively manage public finances to achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability and long-term growth and to make effective and transparent use of public funds and ensure that development assistance is used to build national capacities
• Support, starting in 2005, efforts by developing countries to adopt and implement national development policies and strategies, through the provision of increased development assistance, and to promote international trade as an engine for development, transfer of technology, increased investment flows and wider and deeper debt relief, bearing in mind the need for an appropriate balance between national policy space and international disciplines and commitments
• Support developing countries by providing a predictable and sufficient increase in aid of sufficient quality and arriving in a timely manner to enable them to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and ensure that developing countries have the required policy space to formulate their national development strategies
• Enhance the role of non-governmental organizations, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders in national development efforts, as well as in the promotion of the global partnership for development
Financing for development
We reaffirm the Monterrey Consensus and recognize that mobilizing financial resources for development and the effective use of those resources in recipient countries are central to a global partnership for development in support of the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration.
In this regard:
• We are encouraged by recent commitments to substantially increase official development assistance, while recognizing that a substantial increase in such assistance is required to achieve the internationally agreed goals, including, by 2015, the Millennium Development Goals
• We stress the need to maximize domestic resources to fund national development strategies
• We welcome private sector contributions to development and humanitarian relief
• We welcome the establishment of timetables by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance by no later than 2015 and to reach at least 0.5 per cent by 2009 and invite those developed countries which have not yet done so to make concrete efforts to establish timetables in order to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent; in addition, we urge those developed countries to achieve the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance to least developed countries
• We further welcome recent efforts and initiatives to enhance the quality of aid and to increase its impact, including the Paris Declaration of the High-level Forum on Joint Progress towards Enhanced Aid Effectiveness, and resolve to take concrete, effective and timely action to implement all agreed commitments on aid effectiveness, including through further aligning assistance with countries' strategies, building institutional capacities, reducing transaction costs and eliminating bureaucratic procedures, enhancing the absorptive capacity and financial management of recipient countries and strengthening the focus on development results
• We recognize the need for increased and more predictable resources, and in that regard take note with interest of international efforts, contributions and discussions, such as the Action against Hunger and Poverty, aimed at identifying innovative and additional sources of financing for development on a public, private, domestic or external basis, welcome the pilot projects to be implemented on a voluntary basis for an international finance facility for immunization and a solidarity contribution from plane tickets to finance development projects, in particular in the health sector, including the fight against HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, and agree to consider further other solidarity contributions that would be nationally applied and internationally coordinated
• We underline the urgent need for increased investment now, and therefore for the immediate front-loading of additional official development assistance commitments and, in that regard, welcome the decision to launch, in 2005, an international finance facility, on a voluntary basis, to support the immediate front-loading of official development assistance commitments and encourage broad participation
• We resolve to promote greater foreign direct investment flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition to support their development activities and to enhance the benefits they can derive from such investments
• We commit to undertake measures to promote and sustain adequate and stable international capital flows to developing countries, particularly countries in Africa, the least developed countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, and to countries with economies in transition
• We resolve to continue to support the development efforts of middle-income developing countries by agreeing, in competent multilateral and international forums and through bilateral arrangements, on measures to help them meet their financial, technical and technological requirements, including through appropriate debt relief schemes
• We undertake to operationalize the World Solidarity Fund established by the General Assembly, including by making voluntary contributions to it
Debt
We emphasize the urgent need for an effective, comprehensive, durable and development-oriented solution to the debt problems of developing countries.
To this end we:
• Welcome the recent decision of the Group of Eight countries to cancel 100 per cent of the outstanding debt of eligible heavily indebted poor countries owed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Development Association and the French Development Agency and to provide additional resources to ensure that the financing capacity of the international financial institutions is not reduced
• Stress that in assessing debt sustainability, consideration should be given to the level of debt that allows a country to achieve its national development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, recognizing the key role that debt relief can play in liberating resources than can then be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development
• Further stress the need to consider additional measures and initiatives aimed at ensuring long-term debt sustainability through increased grant-based financing, cancellation of 100 per cent of the official debt of heavily indebted poor countries and significant reduction or cancellation of the debt of many heavily indebted least developed countries that are not part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, as well as of low- and middle-income developing countries.
Such initiatives should include efforts by IMF and the World Bank to develop a debt sustainability framework for low-income countries.
This should be achieved without a reduction in resources channelled as official development assistance or other sources of financing available to developing countries, in recognition of the need to maintain the financial integrity of the multilateral financial institutions
Trade
We recommit to promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, recognizing the major role that trade can play in promoting economic growth, employment and development for all, and undertake to:
• Achieve the fullest realization of the Doha work programme, including the development mandate of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, in particular in the areas identified in the 1 August 2004 decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and to successfully complete, by 2006, the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations
• In the case of developed countries, as well as developing countries in a position to do so, provide immediate duty-free and quota-free market access for all exports from the least developed countries to the markets of those countries and support their efforts to overcome their supply side constraints as well as volatile commodity prices and terms of trade
• Support and promote increased aid to build productive and trade capacities of developing countries and to take further steps in that regard
• Accelerate and facilitate the accession of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to WTO, recognizing the importance of the attainment of universal membership in WTO
Quick-win initiatives
We agree to support the establishment and implementation of country-led “quick-win” initiatives consistent with long-term national development strategies so as to realize major immediate progress towards the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, through such measures as the free distribution of bed nets and effective antimalarial medicines, the expansion of local school meal programmes using home-grown foods and the elimination of user fees for primary education and health services.
Global governance and systemic issues
We reaffirm the commitment contained in the Monterrey Consensus to broaden and strengthen the voice and participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in international economic decision-making and norm-setting, and to that end undertake to find pragmatic and innovative ways to enhance the effective participation of those countries, particularly in the Bretton Woods institutions.
We recognize the urgent need to enhance the coherence, governance and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems.
We reaffirm the need for the United Nations to play a more decisive and central role in international development policy and in ensuring coherence, coordination and implementation of development goals and actions agreed upon by the international community.
South-South cooperation
We recognize the achievements and potential of South-South cooperation and encourage the promotion of such cooperation, which complements North-South cooperation as an effective contribution to development and as a means to share and transfer best practices and appropriate technologies.
In this context, we welcome the recent decision of the leaders of the South to intensify their efforts at South-South cooperation and reiterate the need for the international community, including the international financial institutions, to support the efforts of developing countries, including through the provision of the necessary resources, as well as through triangular cooperation.
Education
We emphasize the critical role of both formal and informal education, in particular basic education and training for eradicating illiteracy, and strive for expanded secondary and higher education as well as vocational education and technical training, especially for girls and women, creating human resources and infrastructure capabilities and empowering those living in poverty.
In this context, we reaffirm the Dakar Framework for Action adopted at the World Education Forum in 2000, and recognize the importance of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization strategy for the eradication of poverty, especially extreme poverty, in supporting the Education for All programmes as a tool to achieve the Millennium Development Goal on universal primary education by 2015.
Rural and agricultural development
We reaffirm that food security and rural and agricultural development must be adequately addressed in the context of national development and response strategies.
We are convinced that the eradication of poverty and hunger is crucial for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
Rural development should be an integral part of national and international development policies.
We deem it necessary to increase productive investment in rural and agricultural development to achieve food security.
We commit ourselves to increase official development assistance for agriculture and trade opportunities in developing countries.
Employment
We strongly support a fair process of globalization and resolve to make the goal of productive employment and decent work for all, including young people, a central objective of our national and international macroeconomic policies as well as our poverty reduction strategies.
Those measures should also encompass the elimination of child labour.
We resolve to protect the human rights of workers.
Sustainable development
We reaffirm our commitment to achieve the goal of sustainable development, including through the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.
We also recommit to undertake concrete actions and measures at all levels, including integrating sustainable development in national development strategies and enhancing international cooperation, taking into account the declaration of principles of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.
We recognize that climate change is a serious and long-term challenge that has the potential to affect every part of the world.
We call for further international technological and financial cooperation for the sustainable use and management of natural resources in order to promote sustainable production and consumption patterns as a means of maintaining a balance between the conservation of natural resources and the furtherance of social and economic objectives.
We therefore resolve to:
• Promote sustainable consumption and production patterns as called for in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation
• Undertake concerted global action to mitigate climate change, including by meeting all commitments and obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other relevant international agreements, increase energy efficiency and technological innovation and initiate negotiations to develop a more inclusive international framework for climate change beyond 2012, with broader participation by both developing and developed countries, taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities
• Continue to assist developing countries, particularly small island developing States, least developed countries and African countries, in addressing their adaptation needs relating to the adverse effects of climate change
• Combat desertification by supporting the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa
• Support the Implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Johannesburg commitment for a significant reduction in the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010 and undertake to intensify ongoing efforts to elaborate and negotiate an international regime on access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing, with the aim of adopting an instrument or instruments to effectively implement relevant provisions and objectives of the Convention
• Establish, by 2006, a worldwide early warning system for all natural hazards, with regional nodes, building on existing national and regional capacity
• Fully implement the Hyogo Declaration and the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 adopted at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, particularly those commitments related to assistance to affected and disaster-prone developing countries
• Assist developing countries' efforts to provide access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation for all in accordance with the Millennium Declaration and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, accelerate the preparation of national integrated water management and water-efficiency plans and launch a programme of action, with financial and technical support, to halve by 2015 the proportion of people living without safe drinking water or basic sanitation
• Improve access to reliable, affordable, economically viable and environmentally sound energy sources and services, in particular to developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed
• Strengthen the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests for the benefit of current and future generations by supporting the United Nations Forum on Forests, with the assistance of the collaborative partnership on forests, as key intergovernmental mechanisms to facilitate and coordinate the implementation of sustainable forest management at the national, regional and global levels
• Improve cooperation and coordination at all levels in order to address all aspects of oceans and seas in an integrated manner and to promote integrated management and sustainable development of the oceans and seas
• Achieve significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers by 2015, recognizing the urgent need for the provision of increased resources for affordable housing and housing-related infrastructure, prioritizing slum prevention and slum upgrading as well as increased contributions to the United Nations Human Settlements Foundation and its Slum Upgrading Facility
HIV/AIDS and other health issues
We recognize that HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases pose severe risks for the entire world and serious challenges to the achievement of development goals.
These diseases and other emerging health challenges require a concerted international response.
To this end, we commit ourselves to:
• Ensure that the resources needed for prevention, treatment, care and support, the elimination of stigma and discrimination, enhanced access to affordable medicines, reduced vulnerability of affected persons, in particular orphaned children, an expanded and comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS and the full funding of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as of United Nations system agencies and programmes engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS, are provided universally by 2010
• Fully implement the commitments made by the General Assembly at its special session on HIV/AIDS
• Strengthen by 2010 the health-care system in developing countries, through the provision of sufficient health workers, resources, infrastructure, management systems and supplies, to achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals and to launch by 2006 a global initiative to strengthen the national health-care systems in developing countries, building on existing mechanisms
• Welcome the adoption at the 2005 World Health Assembly of the revised international health regulations, call upon all States to ensure their full implementation, and emphasize the need to increase resources for the World Health Organization Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network
• Actively work to implement the “Three Ones” principles in all countries, including by ensuring that multiple institutions and international partners all work with national AIDS coordinating authorities to align their support to national strategies, policies, systems, cycles, annual priorities and action plans
• Achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015 as set out at the International Conference on Population and Development, integrating this goal in strategies to attain the international development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration aiming at improving maternal health, reducing child mortality, promoting gender equality, combating HIV/AIDS and eradicating poverty
• Ensure long-term public funding for academic and industrial research, as well as for the development of new medicines and treatments to address the great pandemics and other tropical diseases
Gender equality and empowerment of women
We reaffirm that the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action is essential to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and resolve to promote gender equality and eliminate pervasive gender discrimination by:
• Eliminating gender inequalities in primary and secondary education by 2006 and at all educational levels by 2015
• Guaranteeing the right of women to property and inheritance laws and ensuring secure tenure of property to women
• Ensuring access to reproductive health
• Promoting women's equal access to labour markets and sustainable employment, as well as adequate labour protections
• Ensuring the protection of women in armed conflict in accordance with the obligations of States under international humanitarian law
• Promoting equal participation of men and women in government decision-making bodies
• Supporting direct action to protect women and girls from violence, including by ending impunity, in particular in situations of wars and civil strife
We recognize the importance of gender mainstreaming as a tool for achieving gender equality.
To that end, we undertake to actively promote the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and social spheres, and we further undertake to strengthen the United Nations system's capabilities in the area of gender.
Science and technology for development
We recognize that science and technology play a critical role in the achievement of the development goals and that international support is essential for enabling developing countries to benefit from the technological advancements.
We therefore commit to:
• Strengthen and enhance existing mechanisms and continue global initiatives to support research and development to address the special needs of developing countries in the areas of health, agriculture, conservation, sustainable use of natural resources, environmental management, energy, forestry and the impact of climate change
• Promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, access to and the development of technologies, including environmentally sound technologies and corresponding know-how, and their transfer and diffusion to developing countries
• Implement policies at the national and international levels to attract both domestic and foreign investments that enhance knowledge, transfer technology and raise productivity
• Supplement the efforts of developing countries, individually and collectively, to harness new agricultural technologies in order to increase agricultural productivity through environmentally sustainable means
• Build a people-centred and inclusive information society so as to bridge the digital divide, put the potential of information and communication technologies at the service of development and address new challenges of the information society by implementing the outcomes of the Geneva phase of the World Summit on the Information Society and by ensuring the success of the second phase of the Summit, to be held in Tunis in November 2005
Migration
We acknowledge the important nexus between international migration and development and the need to deal with this issue in a coordinated and coherent manner with a view to addressing the challenges and opportunities that migration presents to countries of origin, destination and transit.
We recognize that international migration brings benefits as well as challenges to the global community.
We further recognize the need to enhance international cooperation on migration issues to ensure that the movement of people across borders is managed in a more effective and humane manner.
In this regard, we resolve to ensure the success of the General Assembly's high-level dialogue on international migration and development to be held in 2006, which will offer an opportunity to discuss the multidimensional aspects of international migration and development in order to identify appropriate ways and means to maximize its development benefits and minimize its negative impacts.
Countries with special needs
We reaffirm our commitment to address the special needs of the least developed countries and urge developed countries, developing countries in a position to do so and all relevant organizations of the United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods institutions, to make concerted efforts and adopt speedy measures for meeting in timely manner the goals and targets of the Brussels Programme of Action for the least developed countries for the decade 2001-2010.
We recognize the special needs of and challenges faced by landlocked developing countries and therefore reaffirm our commitment to urgently address those needs and challenges through the full, timely and effective implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action and the São Paulo Consensus adopted at the eleventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Such implementation should be quantified with a time-bound set of indicators to measure the progress.
We recognize the special needs and vulnerabilities of small island developing States and reaffirm our commitment to take urgent and concrete action to address those needs and vulnerabilities through the full and effective implementation of the Mauritius Strategy adopted by the International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, the Barbados Programme of Action and the outcome of the twenty-second special session of the General Assembly.
We further undertake, starting in 2006, to promote greater international cooperation for the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy through the mobilization of financial resources on a more predictable basis.
We also emphasize the need for continued, coordinated and effective international support for achieving the development goals in countries emerging from conflict and recovering from disasters, in particular through the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission.
Meeting the special needs of Africa
Welcoming the substantial progress Africa has made in recent years in addressing its challenges and realizing its opportunities, and also welcoming the recent decisions taken by African partners, including the Group of Eight countries and the European Union, in support of Africa's development efforts, we reaffirm our commitment to urgently meet the special needs of Africa, which is the only continent not on track to meet any of the goals of the Millennium Declaration by 2015, to enable it to enter the mainstream of the world economy, and resolve to:
• Strengthen cooperation with the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) by providing coherent support for the programmes drawn up by African leaders within that framework, including by mobilizing external financial resources and facilitating approval of such programmes by the multilateral financial institutions
• Support African commitment to ensure that by 2015 all children have access to a complete, free and compulsory education of good quality, as well as to basic health care
• Support the building of an international infrastructure consortium — involving the African Union, NEPAD, the World Bank and the African Development Bank — to be recognized by NEPAD as the lead agency for facilitating infrastructure investment
• Promote a comprehensive and durable solution to the external debt problems of African countries, including through the cancellation of 100 per cent of multilateral debt consistent with the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and significant reduction or cancellation of the debt of heavily indebted low- and middle-income developing countries that are not part of the Initiative
• Make efforts to fully integrate African countries in the international trading system, including through targeted capacity-building programmes on bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations
• Support the efforts of commodity-dependent African countries to restructure, diversify and strengthen the competitiveness of their commodity sectors and decide to work towards market-based arrangements with the participation of the private sector for commodity price-risk management
• Supplement the efforts of African countries, individually and collectively, to increase agricultural productivity, in a sustainable way, as part of an African “Green Revolution” to be launched in 2005
• Encourage and support the African regional and subregional organizations' initiatives to prevent, mediate and resolve conflicts with the assistance of the United Nations, and in this regard welcome the proposals from the Group of Eight countries to provide extra resources for African peacekeeping
• Provide, as a priority, assistance for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment in African countries on a grant basis, encourage pharmaceutical companies to make antiretroviral drugs affordable and accessible in Africa and ensure increased support for bilateral and multilateral assistance to combat malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in Africa
Peace and collective security
We recognize that we are facing a whole range of threats, including armed conflicts between and within States, the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, terrorism and organized crime, poverty and the rapid spread of highly infectious diseases and severe environmental degradation that require our urgent, collective and more determined response.
We recognize that, in accordance with the Charter, addressing such threats requires a comprehensive approach and cooperation among all the principal organs of the United Nations within their respective competence.
We acknowledge that we are living in an interdependent and global world and that today's threats recognize no national boundaries, are interlinked and must be tackled at the global, regional and national levels.
We therefore reaffirm our commitment to implement a security consensus based on the recognition that many threats are interlinked, that development, security and human rights are mutually reinforcing, that no State can best protect itself by acting entirely alone and that all States need an effective, equitable and efficient collective security system, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter.
We resolve to take concerted action, through such a system of collective security, based on the Charter and respect for international law, so as to prevent, mitigate and remove threats to international peace and security, respond effectively to natural disasters and ensure economic development and the full enjoyment of human rights for all States and peoples.
Protecting children in armed conflict
We reaffirm our commitment to promote and protect the right and welfare of children in armed conflict.
We call upon States, as appropriate, to become a party to and implement the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and to take effective measures to prevent the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and groups and to prohibit and criminalize such practices.
We also reaffirm our commitment to ensure that children in armed conflict receive timely and effective humanitarian assistance, including education, and to undertake effective measures for their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
Pacific settlement of disputes
We call upon States to refrain from the threat and use of force contrary to the Charter and to settle their disputes by peaceful means in accordance with Chapter VI of the Charter, including, when appropriate, by the most effective use of the International Court of Justice.
All States shall also act in accordance with the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter.
We stress the importance of conflict prevention in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and solemnly renew our commitment to promote a culture of prevention as a means of effectively addressing the interconnected security and development challenges faced by peoples throughout the world, as well as to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations for conflict prevention and to ensure that conflict prevention is a centrepiece of effective multilateralism and United Nations reform.
We further stress the importance of a coherent and comprehensive approach to the prevention of armed conflicts and the settlement of disputes and the need for the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Secretary-General to coordinate their activities within their respective Charter mandates.
Recognizing the important role of the good offices of the Secretary-General, including in the mediation of disputes, we support the Secretary-General's efforts to strengthen his capacity in this area.
Women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts
We stress the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding.
We also underline the importance of the integration of a gender perspective and women's equal participation and full involvement in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security, as well as the need to increase their role in decision-making at all levels.
We strongly condemn all violations of the human rights of women and girls in situations of armed conflict and the use of sexual exploitation, violence and abuse, and commit to elaborating and implementing strategies to prevent and report on gender-based violence.
Peacekeeping
Recognizing that peacekeeping plays a vital role in helping parties to conflict end hostilities, noting improvements made in recent years in United Nations peacekeeping and stressing the need to mount operations with adequate capacity to counter hostilities and fulfil effectively their mandates, we urge further consideration of the proposal for the establishment of a strategic military reserve capacity to reinforce United Nations peacekeeping missions in times of crisis and the creation of a standing capacity for the rapid deployment of United Nations civilian police in peacekeeping.
Recognizing the vital contribution to peace and security being made by regional organizations and the importance of forging predictable partnerships between the United Nations and regional organizations, and noting in particular, given the special needs of Africa, the importance of a strong African Union, we agree to:
• Support the efforts of the European Union and other regional entities to develop a standby capacity
• Develop and implement a 10-year plan for capacity-building with the African Union
We insist on the highest standards of behaviour from all personnel deployed in peacekeeping operations and urge the full and vigorous implementation of the Secretary-General's zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual exploitation and abuse in all United Nations activities.
We commit to ensure that there will be no impunity for those who have committed crimes and will undertake to institute appropriate disciplinary action in cases where an individual has been found to have committed wrongdoing.
Peacebuilding
Emphasizing the need for a coordinated, coherent, comprehensive and integrated approach to conflict resolution and post-conflict peacebuilding with a view to achieving sustainable peace, recognizing the need for a dedicated institutional mechanism to address the special need of countries emerging from conflict towards recovery, reintegration and development and recognizing further the vital role of the United Nations in that regard, we hereby establish a Peacebuilding Commission as an intergovernmental advisory body to assist and mobilize support to countries emerging from conflict.
The main purpose of the Peacebuilding Commission is to bring together all relevant actors to marshal resources and to advise on and propose comprehensive strategies for peacebuilding and post-conflict recovery.
To that end, it will provide necessary information in the immediate aftermath of war and focus attention on the development and institution-building efforts necessary for recovery as well as provide recommendations and information to improve the coordination of all stakeholders within and outside the United Nations, develop best practices, help to ensure predictable financing for early recovery activities and extend the period of attention by the international community to post-conflict recovery.
The Peacebuilding Commission will consider any matter brought before it by the Security Council.
Any State Member of the United Nations in an exceptionally difficult situation, on the verge of relapsing into conflict, should be able to request, through the Economic and Social Council, the advice of the Peacebuilding Commission if the Security Council is not seized of the situation in question.
The Peacebuilding Commission's organizational committee should consider the relevance of the request.
The Peacebuilding Commission will make the outcome of its discussions available to all relevant bodies and actors of the United Nations, including the international financial institutions.
The Peacebuilding Commission will provide advice on peacebuilding strategies for countries emerging from conflict to such bodies as are actively seized of the issue, in accordance with the Charter.
In the initial stages of conflict recovery and for as long as the Security Council is actively seized of the situation, the Peacebuilding Commission will provide advice to that body.
Thereafter, the Peacebuilding Commission will provide advice to the Economic and Social Council.
The Peacebuilding Commission will submit an annual report to the General Assembly.
The composition of the Peacebuilding Commission will vary according to the case at hand.
Members will be selected in the order indicated below, and there will be no double representation of States.
Attention will be paid to geographical representation.
The Commission will include:
(a) Members of an organizational committee responsible for developing its procedures and for organizational matters, which should comprise:
(i) The five permanent members of the Security Council;
(ii) Five members of the Economic and Social Council, to be selected by the Council on an annual basis;
(iii) The five top providers of assessed contributions (to the United Nations regular budget) and voluntary contributions (to the United Nations funds, programmes and agencies), to be determined annually on the basis of a list to be provided by the Secretary-General;
(iv) The five top contributors of troops to the United Nations, to be determined annually on the basis of a list to be provided by the Secretary-General;
(b) Additional members invited to participate when the Commission discusses a country-specific matter, namely:
(i) National authorities of the country under consideration, as appropriate;
(ii) Countries in the region, as well as relevant regional and subregional organizations;

(iv) The senior United Nations representative in the field and other relevant United Nations representatives;
(v) Such regional financial institutions as may be relevant;
(vi) Other parties directly relevant for the country under consideration.
Representatives from the World Bank and IMF should be invited to participate in all meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission in a manner suitable to their governing arrangements, in addition to a representative of the Secretary-General.
We request the Secretary-General to establish a multi-year standing fund for post-conflict peacebuilding, funded by voluntary contributions and taking due account of existing instruments.
We request the Secretary-General to establish within the Secretariat and within existing resources a small peacebuilding support office to assist and support the Commission.
We request the President of the General Assembly, assisted by the Secretary-General, to conduct consultations with Member States in order to develop the necessary modalities for the effective operation of the Peacebuilding Commission, including its rules of procedure, financial arrangements for its functioning and the selection of the chairs, so that the body can begin operation no later than 31 December 2005.
The arrangements set out above will be kept under review with a view to ensuring that they are appropriate to carrying out the agreed functions of the Commission.
Any future proposals to change the arrangements, hereby agreed upon, should be forwarded jointly by the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council to the General Assembly for its approval.
Sanctions
We agree that sanctions remain an important tool under the Charter in our efforts to maintain international peace and security without recourse to the use of force and resolve to ensure that sanctions are carefully targeted in support of clear objectives, subject to time limits, where appropriate, and that they are implemented and monitored effectively with clear benchmarks and accountability, and also resolve to comply with sanctions established by the Security Council and to ensure that sanctions are implemented in ways that mitigate the adverse consequences, including socio-economic and humanitarian consequences, for populations and third States.
We call upon the Security Council, with the support of the Secretary-General, to improve its monitoring of the implementation and effects of sanctions, to ensure that sanctions are implemented in an accountable manner and to review regularly the results of such monitoring, and also to develop a mechanism to address special economic problems arising from the application of sanctions, in accordance with the Charter.
We also call upon the Security Council and the Secretary-General to ensure that fair and transparent procedures, in accordance with international standards of due process, exist for placing individuals and entities on sanctions lists and for removing them, as well as for granting humanitarian exemptions.
We agree to support efforts through United Nations agencies to strengthen State capacity to implement sanctions provisions.
Use of force
We reiterate our commitment to refrain from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.
We reaffirm that one of the purposes and principles guiding the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, and to that end resolve to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, as well as to bring about by peaceful means, in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, the adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations that might lead to a breach of the peace.
We reaffirm that the relevant provisions of the Charter regarding the use of force are sufficient to address the full range of security threats and agree that the use of force should be considered an instrument of last resort.
We further reaffirm the authority of the Security Council to take action to maintain and restore international peace and security, in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the Charter.
We recognize the need to continue discussing principles for the use of force, as identified by the Secretary-General.
Disarmament and non-proliferation
We appeal to all States to pursue and intensify negotiations with a view to advancing disarmament and strengthening the international non-proliferation regime.
We urge all States to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and pledge to comply fully with all the articles of those conventions in order to strengthen the multilateral framework for non-proliferation and disarmament and to achieve full adherence to those instruments.
We reiterate our firm commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its three pillars: disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
We look forward to strengthening the implementation of the Treaty, including through future review conferences.
We resolve to:
• Appeal to all States to take action, in a multilateral framework, to prevent and eliminate the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery
• Appeal to the nuclear weapon States to take concrete steps towards nuclear disarmament with the objective of eliminating all such weapons, including through the implementation of article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty
• Maintain a moratorium on nuclear test explosions pending the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and call upon all States to become a party to the Treaty
• Strengthen verification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by concluding the Model Additional Protocol, the standard for compliance, and to conclude such protocols without delay, call for universal accession to the comprehensive safeguards agreements, as provided for in article III of the Treaty, and to additional protocols, and recognize that such instruments enable the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify the peaceful use of nuclear energy, thus preventing nuclear proliferation
• Support and continue to work towards the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, created by means of arrangements freely arrived at by consensus among the States of the region concerned, in order to reinforce regional peace and coexistence, prevent proliferation and advance disarmament
• Call upon the nuclear-weapon States to reaffirm their commitment to negative security assurances
• Strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention through continued multilateral and national efforts to improve its verification and implementation, and encourage all States parties to submit information on confidence-building measures as required by the review conference of the parties to the Convention
• Complete the destruction of chemical weapon stockpiles, consistent with the Chemical Weapons Convention, in a timely and effective manner
• Prevent non-State actors from gaining access to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, related technology and materials as well as their means of delivery, including by strengthening relevant national control measures and by complying with Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)
• Promote timely agreements to prevent the spread of uranium enrichment and plutonium separation technologies and facilities that respect fully the right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as set out in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, including alternatives such as the provision of guaranteed nuclear fuel supplies
• Urge the Conference on Disarmament to agree on a programme of work that includes the commencement, without delay, of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty
• Encourage States parties to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material to seek early ratification of the amendment adopted on 8 July 2005, and also encourage those States which have not yet done so to promptly accede to the Convention and to ratify the amendment thereto
• Develop effective multilaterally negotiated measures to prevent an arms race in outer space
• Explore effective measures to prevent and combat the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, related technology and materials and rockets and shoulder-fired missiles, as well as to ban their transfer to non-State actors, including by implementing effective national export controls
• Urge States involved in the transport of radioactive materials by sea through the regions of small island developing States to continue to engage in dialogue with those and other coastal States so as to address their concerns, particularly those related to further development and strengthening, within the appropriate forums, of international regulatory regimes, and to enhance safety, disclosure, viability, security and compensation in relation to such transport
We agree to adopt and implement international instruments to regulate the marking, tracing, illicit brokering and transfer of small arms and light weapons.
We agree to ensure the effective monitoring and enforcement of United Nations arms embargoes.
We urge States parties to fully implement their obligations under the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and encourage those States which have not yet done so to promptly accede to the Convention.
We call upon States in a position to do so to provide greater technical assistance to mine-affected States.
We invite all States to implement confidence-building and disarmament measures with a view to promoting and strengthening the regional and international security environment.
Terrorism
We strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as it constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.
We welcome the Secretary-General's counter-terrorism strategy and will consider it in the General Assembly with a view to adopting it.
We affirm that the targeting and deliberate killing of civilians and non-combatants cannot be justified or legitimized by any cause or grievance, and declare that any action intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants, when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population or to compel a Government or an international organization to carry out or to abstain from any act, cannot be justified on any grounds and constitutes an act of terrorism.
We resolve to conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, including a legal definition of terrorism, during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.
We recognize that international cooperation to fight terrorism should be conducted in conformity with international law, including the Charter and relevant international conventions and protocols.
States should adhere to the principles of good governance, respect for human rights and the rule of law in the fight against terrorism.
We acknowledge the important role played by the United Nations in combating terrorism and also stress the vital contribution of regional and bilateral cooperation, particularly at the practical level of law enforcement cooperation and technical exchange.
We urge the international community, including the United Nations, to assist States in building regional and national capacity to fight terrorism.
We further invite the Secretary-General to strengthen continuously, in consultation with the General Assembly and the Security Council, the capacities of the United Nations and its relevant funds, programmes and specialized and related agencies, to assist States in those endeavours.
We commit to assist victims of terrorism around the world and to provide them and their families with support to cope with their loss and their grief.
We call upon the Security Council to consider ways to strengthen its verification, monitoring and enforcement in the context of its role in counter-terrorism and to streamline its counter-terrorism subsidiary bodies, including by consolidating State reporting requirements.
We support the early entry into force of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and strongly encourage States that have not yet become a party to it to do so, as well as to accede to the 12 other international conventions and protocols against terrorism without further delay and to fully implement them.
Transnational crime
We express our grave concern at the negative effects on development, peace and security and human rights posed by transnational crime, including the smuggling of and trafficking in human beings, narcotic drugs and small arms and light weapons, and at the increasing vulnerability of States to such crime.
We reaffirm the need to work collectively to combat transnational crime.
We recognize that trafficking in persons continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a concerted international response.
To that end, we urge all States to devise, enforce and strengthen effective measures to combat and eliminate all forms of trafficking in persons.
We urge all States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international conventions on organized crime and corruption and to implement them effectively, including by incorporating the provisions of those conventions into national legislation and by strengthening criminal justice systems.
We decide to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to provide assistance to Member States in those tasks upon request.
Human rights and the rule of law
We recommit ourselves to protect and promote human rights, the rule of law and democracy, recognize that they constitute together universal and indivisible core values and principles of the United Nations and that no security agenda or drive for development will be successful unless they are based on respect for human dignity and call upon all parts of the United Nations system to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We recommit ourselves to universal adherence to human rights as enshrined in the Charter and to the full implementation of the human rights standards contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other human rights instruments.
Human rights
We emphasize the responsibilities of all States, in conformity with the Charter, to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.
We resolve further to strengthen the United Nations human rights machinery with the aim of ensuring effective enjoyment by all of all human rights — civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development.
We commit ourselves to promote human rights education and learning at all levels, including through the implementation of the World Programme for Human Rights Education, and we encourage all States to develop initiatives in this regard.
We resolve to strengthen the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and its field offices, taking note of the High Commissioner's plan of action, to enable it to effectively carry out its mandate so as to respond to the broad range of human rights challenges facing the international community, particularly in the areas of technical assistance and capacity-building, through the doubling of its regular budget resources over the next five years and the recruitment of highly competent staff, on a broad geographical basis and with gender balance, provided under the regular budget, and we support its closer cooperation with all relevant United Nations bodies, including the Security Council.
We resolve to improve the effectiveness of the human rights treaty bodies, including through more timely reporting, additional resources and improved and streamlined reporting procedures aimed at enabling the treaty bodies to function as a unified system, and to promote the implementation of their recommendations.
We support the further mainstreaming of human rights throughout the United Nations system.
We recognize the need for special attention to human rights of women and children and undertake to advance them in every possible way, including by bringing gender and child-protection perspectives into the human rights agenda.
We note that the private sector also has an important responsibility and role in the advancement of human rights in a significant way and encourage it to contribute to that end.
Internally displaced persons
We recognize the importance of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement as the minimum international standard for the protection of internally displaced persons and commit ourselves to promote the implementation of those principles through national legislation and practices.
Refugee protection and assistance
We commit ourselves to safeguard the principle of refugee protection and to uphold our responsibility in resolving the plight of refugees, through efforts aimed at addressing the causes of displacement, bringing about the safe and sustainable return of these populations, finding durable solutions for refugees in protracted situations and preventing refugee movement from becoming a source of tension among States.
We agree to support nations in assisting refugee populations and their host communities.
Rule of law
Recognizing the need for universal adherence to and implementation of the rule of law at both the national and international levels, we:
• Reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter and international law and to an international order based on the rule of law, which is essential for peaceful coexistence and cooperation among States
• Support the annual treaty event
• Encourage any Government that has not yet done so to agree to ratify and implement all treaties relating to the protection of civilians
• Call upon States to continue their efforts to eradicate policies and practices that discriminate against women and to adopt laws and promote practices that protect the rights of women and promote gender equality
• Support the establishment of a rule of law assistance unit within the Secretariat to strengthen United Nations activities to promote the rule of law and related human rights law through technical assistance and capacity-building
• Recognize the important role of the International Court of Justice in adjudicating disputes among States, call upon States that have not yet done so to consider recognizing the jurisdiction of the Court and to make greater use of the Court's advisory opinions and agree to consider means of strengthening the Court's work, including by supporting the Secretary-General's Trust Fund to Assist States in the Settlement of Disputes through the International Court of Justice
Democracy
We reaffirm that democracy is a universal value, implying the will of peoples to express and decide freely their own political system, that it does not belong to any country or region and that education in human rights and democracy is essential for participation in the democratic process and governance.
We stress that democracy, development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing.
We renew our commitment to support democracy at the national, regional and international levels by strengthening countries' capacities to implement the principles and practices of democracy at the national, regional and international levels and resolve to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to assist Member States upon their request.
We therefore welcome the establishment of a Democracy Fund at the United Nations and invite the Secretary-General to establish an advisory board to provide policy guidance.
We invite Member States to contribute to the Democracy Fund.
Impunity
Recognizing that justice is a vital component of the rule of law, we commit to end impunity for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, such as crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, by cooperating with the International Criminal Court, the existing ad hoc and mixed criminal tribunals and other mechanisms for international justice.
Responsibility to protect
We agree that the responsibility to protect civilian populations lies first and foremost with each individual State, and we accept that responsibility and agree to act in accordance with it.
The international community should, as appropriate, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility.
The international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, including under Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, to help protect civilian populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
In this context, we recognize our shared responsibility to take collective action, through the Security Council and, as appropriate, in cooperation with relevant regional arrangements, under Chapter VII of the Charter, should peaceful means prove insufficient and national authorities be unwilling or unable to protect their populations.
We stress the need to continue at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly consideration of the concept of the responsibility to protect.
We support the implementation of the United Nations Action Plan to Prevent Genocide and the work of the Secretariat to this end.
Human security
We stress the right of people to live in freedom and dignity.
We recognize that human security is a guiding principle of the vital need to protect civilian populations from the insecurities generated by current threats and challenges affecting people's lives.
We therefore commit to promote human security as a means to empower people and address effectively those insecurities.
Culture of peace and initiatives on dialogue among cultures and civilizations
Recognizing the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, as well as the Global Agenda for Dialogue Among Civilizations and its Programme of Action, adopted by the General Assembly, and the value of different initiatives on dialogue among cultures and civilizations, we commit to take action to promote a culture of peace and dialogue at the national level, as well as at the regional and international levels, and request the Secretary-General to explore enhancing implementation mechanisms and to follow up on those initiatives.
Strengthening the United Nations
We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen the United Nations with a view to enhancing its authority and efficiency, as well as its capacity to address effectively the full range of the challenges of our time.
We are determined to reinvigorate the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations and to adapt them to the needs of the twenty-first century.
We stress that, in order to efficiently perform their respective mandates as provided under the Charter, all United Nations bodies should not duplicate their work but should rather develop good cooperation and coordination in the common endeavour of building a more effective United Nations.
We emphasize the need to provide the United Nations with sufficient and predictable resources with a view to enabling it to carry out its mandate in the fast-changing, complex and challenging world.
We emphasize the importance of establishing real, effective and efficient mechanisms for responsibility and accountability in the Secretariat.
General Assembly
We reaffirm the central position of the General Assembly as the most representative deliberative, policymaking and decision-making organ of the United Nations, as well as the role of the Assembly in the process of the codification of international law.
We welcome the measures adopted by the General Assembly with a view to strengthening its role and authority and enabling the President of the Assembly to play a leadership role, and, to that end, we call for their full and speedy implementation.
We call for the strengthening of the relationship between the General Assembly and the other principal organs to ensure better coordination on topical issues that require coordinated action by the United Nations.
We stress the need to demonstrate the political will to effectively implement the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly.
Security Council
We reaffirm that Member States have conferred on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, acting on their behalf, as provided by the Charter.
We support comprehensive reform of the Security Council to make it more broadly representative, more efficient and more transparent so as to enhance the legitimacy of its decisions and its effectiveness.
We recommend that the Security Council adapt its working methods so as to increase the involvement of States not members of the Council in its work, enhance its accountability to the membership and increase the transparency of its work.
Economic and Social Council
We reaffirm the role that the Charter and the General Assembly have vested in the Economic and Social Council and recognize the need for a more effective Economic and Social Council, as a principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on issues of economic and social development, as well as for implementing the international development goals agreed at major summits and conferences.
To achieve these objectives, the Council should perform the following functions:
• Promote global dialogue and partnership on global policies and trends in the economic, social, environmental and humanitarian fields.
For this purpose, the Council will serve as a quality platform for high-level engagement among Member States and with international institutions, the private sector and civil society and for discussions on emerging global trends, policies and action, and will develop its ability to respond better and more rapidly to developments in the international economic, environmental and social fields
• Monitor and report on developing and developed countries' compliance and progress towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals
• Strengthen its role to promote the implementation of commitments and serve as a development cooperation forum by, inter alia, holding biennially a high-level development cooperation forum reviewing trends in international development cooperation, including in relation to strategies, policies and financing; promoting greater coherence among the development activities of different development partners; and strengthening the links between the normative and operational work of the United Nations
• Strengthen operational coordination by, among other activities, holding annual ministerial-level policy-coordinating meetings to carry out substantive reviews of existing global policies and assessments of progress towards the implementation of the outcomes of major conferences and summits and internationally agreed development goals, including a pilot process of voluntary peer reviews of progress, drawing on its functional and regional commissions, as well as other international institutions; convening timely meetings in order to support and complement international efforts aimed at addressing threats to development, including humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters, in order to promote an improved coordinated response from the United Nations; and playing a major role in the overall coordination of funds, programmes and agencies, ensuring coherence among them and avoiding duplication of mandates and activities
• Focus on the linkage between peace and development.
For this purpose, the Economic and Social Council will strengthen its work in post-conflict activities by working with the Peacebuilding Commission; reinforce linkage between the Economic and Social Council and Security Council on post-conflict management, building on the experience of the advisory groups on countries emerging from conflict; and maintain international attention and support, as well as enhance system-wide inter-agency coordination in support of Governments, during the long-term reconstruction, recovery and reconciliation phase
We stress that in order to fully perform the aforementioned functions, the organization of work, agenda and reporting requirements of the Economic and Social Council should be adapted.
Human Rights Council
Pursuant to our commitment to give greater priority to human rights in the work of the United Nations and to strengthen the human rights machinery of the organization, we decide to establish a standing Human Rights Council as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly to be based in Geneva, in replacement of the Commission on Human Rights.
The General Assembly shall review within five years the question of whether the Council should be transformed into a principal organ.
The Human Rights Council will have the following mandate, size and composition:
(a) It will be the organ primarily responsible for promoting universal respect for and observance and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner, recognizing their indivisible, inalienable and interrelated character.
To carry out this mandate, the Council shall assume and review all the functions of the Commission on Human Rights and preserve its strengths, including the system of special procedures.
In particular it will:
(i) Serve as a forum for dialogue on thematic issues relating to all human rights and fundamental freedoms and make recommendations to the General Assembly for the further development of international law in the field of human rights;
(ii) Promote international cooperation to enhance the abilities of Member States to implement human rights commitments, including international norms and standards, and the provision of assistance by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to Member States, at their request, through programmes of advisory services, technical cooperation and capacity-building;
(iii) Promote effective coordination and the mainstreaming of human rights within the United Nations system, including by making policy recommendations to the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and other United Nations bodies.
The Council should also work in close cooperation with regional organizations in the field of human rights;
(iv) Evaluate the fulfilment by all States of all their human rights obligations, in particular under the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
This procedure will not duplicate the reporting procedures being carried out under the human rights treaties;
(v) Address any matters or situations related to the promotion and protection of human rights, including urgent human rights situations, and make recommendations thereon to the Member States and provide policy recommendations to the United Nations system;
(b) The Council shall comprise between 30 and 50 members, each serving for a period of three years, to be elected directly by the General Assembly, by a two-thirds majority.
In establishing the membership of the Council, due regard shall be given to the principle of equitable geographical distribution and the contribution of Member States to the promotion and protection of human rights;
(c) Those elected to the Council should undertake to abide by human rights standards in their respect for and protection and promotion of human rights, and will be evaluated during their term of membership under the review mechanism, unless they have been evaluated shortly before the start of their term in the Council;
(d) The arrangements made by the Economic and Social Council for consultations with non-governmental organizations under Article 71 of the Charter shall apply to the Council;
(e) The Council shall submit an annual report to the General Assembly.
We request the President of the General Assembly to conduct consultations with Member States in order to adopt during its sixtieth session, before 31 December 2005, the modalities, functions, procedures and working methods of the Human Rights Council and arrangements for the transition from the Commission to the Council.
Secretariat
Recognizing that a capable and effective Secretariat is indispensable to the work of the United Nations in a rapidly changing world, we urge the Secretary-General to ensure the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, as well as ethical behaviour, transparency and accountability of the Secretariat, with due regard to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide and equitable a geographical basis as possible, in particular at the senior and policymaking levels, and commend the Secretary-General's efforts to further enhance the effective management of the United Nations and his commitment to modernize the United Nations, in particular the Headquarters.
Management reform
We welcome the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General, including new senior management committees and actions to strengthen oversight and accountability, reinforce ethical conduct, enhance transparency and improve management performance, and invite him to report to the General Assembly on the progress made in implementing all such measures.
We recognize the role of the Secretary-General as the chief administrative officer of the United Nations, encourage him to exercise his responsibilities in accordance with the principles of the Charter and pledge to assist him to do so.
We commit to ensure that the Secretary-General has sufficient authority and flexibility to carry out his managerial responsibility and leadership; we support the granting of broad authority to the Secretary-General to redeploy posts and resources from lower- to higher-priority areas, under relevant rules and regulations established by the General Assembly, and invite him to report to the General Assembly each year on outcomes.
We emphasize that, in order to facilitate management, the Secretary-General should conduct and submit to the General Assembly for early action a full review of the budgetary and human resources rules under which the Organization operates, with a view to modernizing and streamlining them and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Secretariat.
We invite the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly, for discussion and decision, an overview of all mandates older than five years originating from resolutions of the General Assembly, taking into account the Organization's continuing functions and priorities, and with an indication of programmatic changes as well as resources which could be shifted, in accordance with rules and regulations on programme planning, in order to strengthen and update the programme of work of the Organization.
We pledge our Governments to act expeditiously on the Secretary-General's recommendations thereon.
We decide that internal oversight shall be strengthened by focusing the expertise and resources of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and by increasing the capacity of the Office to carry out its functions.
We invite the Secretary-General to separate the core oversight functions of the Office from management, to consolidate management consulting and evaluation functions and to use the capacity thereby created to increase productivity throughout the Secretariat, including by modernizing working methods and streamlining systems and processes.
We emphasize the need to build a culture of accountability and integrity in the Organization and resolve to strengthen oversight by ensuring the independence of the Office of Internal Oversight Services through the creation of an independent audit advisory committee.
The committee would have the authority to make recommendations through the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to the General Assembly on the resource requirements for the Office.
It would also be responsible for assessing the efforts of the Office and the Board of Auditors to strengthen the Organization's internal controls and for identifying possible gaps in United Nations oversight coverage.
We agree that the Office of Internal Oversight Services should provide internal oversight services for small United Nations agencies with insufficient current oversight capacity.
We request the Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive proposal on the framework for a one-time staff buyout to modernize and improve personnel structure and quality, including an indication of costs involved and mechanisms to ensure that it achieves its intended purpose, and to submit it to the General Assembly for its decision at the sixtieth session.
We emphasize that the ongoing management reform in the United Nations should make full use of information and communication technologies, helping to give greater efficiency in the use of resources and enhancing organizational capability throughout the United Nations system.
We welcome the Secretary-General's efforts to ensure ethical conduct, more extensive financial disclosure for United Nations officials and enhanced protection for whistleblowers and propose the creation of an independent ethics office to provide the necessary capacity and advice on all ethics-related matters.
We call on the Secretary-General to fully implement the zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations personnel, both at headquarters and in the field.
We urge the Secretary-General to finalize the modalities on victim assistance by 31 December 2005.
We request the Secretary-General to prepare an implementation plan for all of the above-mentioned reforms, in concert with an external expert team, and to submit the plan to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session for consideration at a special high-level plenary meeting to be held in the first quarter of 2006.
In order to strengthen the General Assembly's ability to ensure effective, timely and strategic-level oversight of the Secretariat, we request the President of the Assembly to convene as necessary a geographically representative group of Permanent Representatives to serve as the interface with senior management of the Secretariat and to recommend any necessary corrective actions on management and oversight to the General Assembly.
We welcome the commitment of the Secretary-General to secure a just gender balance in the staffing of the Organization, including at the senior level.
We encourage the Secretary-General and all decision-making bodies to take further steps in mainstreaming a gender perspective in the policies and decisions of the Organization.
We strongly condemn all attacks against the safety and security of the personnel engaged in all United Nations activities.
We urge States to consider becoming parties to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel and to conclude negotiations on a protocol expanding the scope of legal protection during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.
System-wide coherence
We recognize that the United Nations brings together a unique wealth of expertise and resources on global issues.
We commend the extensive experience and expertise of the various development-related organizations, agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system in their diverse and complementary fields of activity, and their important contributions to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the other development objectives established by various United Nations conferences.
We agree to ensure stronger system-wide coherence by implementing the following measures at the policy, operational and humanitarian, and international environmental governance levels:
Policy
• Strengthening linkages between the normative work of the United Nations system and its operational activities
• Coordinating our representation on the governing boards of the various development and humanitarian agencies so as to ensure that they pursue a coherent policy in assigning mandates and allocating resources throughout the system
• Ensuring that the main horizontal policy themes, such as human rights and gender, are taken into account in decision-making throughout the United Nations
• Committing to pledge funding in a more predictable manner
Operational and humanitarian system
• Committing to implementing current reforms aimed at a more unified, better-performing country presence with a single leader and a common management, programming and monitoring framework, and more aligned with country strategies
• Inviting the Secretary-General to launch work to further strengthen the management and coordination of United Nations operational activities so that they can make an even more effective contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals
• Committing ourselves to upholding and respecting humanitarian principles of humanity, independence, neutrality and impartiality and ensuring that humanitarian actors have safe and unimpeded access to vulnerable populations
• Facilitating more rapid humanitarian responses by improving the timeliness of humanitarian funding, in part by contributing to a revised Central Emergency Revolving Fund and, accordingly, by inviting Member States to contribute to the Fund
• Supporting the Secretary-General's efforts to strengthen inter-agency and country-level responses to the needs of internally displaced persons
• Putting in place standby arrangements for personnel and equipment to ensure the capacity to respond immediately to major disasters and other emergencies
• Strengthening Headquarters and field coordination structures and the leadership role of the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and promoting monitoring response and accountability in close collaboration with Governments
International environmental governance
• Strengthening environmental standard-setting, scientific discussion and monitoring and treaty compliance by building on existing institutions, as well as the treaty bodies and specialized agencies
• Integrating environmental activities at the operational level in the broader sustainable development framework
• Recognizing the need for a more coherent institutional framework of international environmental governance, with better coordination and monitoring, and considering the possibility of a more integrated structure, as proposed by the Secretary-General, in particular for environmental standard-setting, scientific discussion, monitoring and assessment and providing broad policy advice and guidance, that is built on existing institutions
Regional organizations
We support a stronger relationship between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations pursuant to Chapter VIII of the Charter, as well as in the areas of economic, social and human rights, and therefore resolve to:
• Expand consultation and cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations through formalized agreements between the respective secretariats, the regularized involvement of regional organizations in the work of the Security Council and the participation of relevant regional organizations in the Peacebuilding Commission
• Ensure that regional organizations that have a capacity for conflict prevention or peacekeeping consider the option of placing such capacities in the framework of the United Nations Standby Arrangements System
• Strengthen cooperation in the areas of economic, social and human rights
• Request the General Assembly, on an exceptional basis, to finance regional operations authorized by the Security Council with assessed contributions
Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union
Recognizing the important role played by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in international affairs, we call for closer cooperation between the United Nations and national parliaments through their world organization with a view to furthering progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and ensuring the effective implementation of United Nations reform.
Participation of non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector
We welcome the positive contribution of non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector in the promotion and implementation of development, security and human rights programmes, stress the importance of their continued engagement with Governments, the United Nations and other international organizations in these key areas and encourage responsible business practices such as those promoted by the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships and the Global Compact initiatives in order to ensure the private sector's contributions to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
We also welcome the dialogue between these organizations and Member States, as reflected in the first informal interactive hearings of the General Assembly with representatives of non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector.
Charter of the United Nations
Considering that the Trusteeship Council no longer meets and that its remaining functions are carried out by other bodies of the United Nations, in particular the General Assembly, we agree to delete Chapter XIII of the Charter and references to the Council in Chapter XII.
We agree to eliminate references to “enemy States” in Articles 53, 77 and 107 of the Charter.
We request the Security Council to consider the composition, mandate and working methods of the Military Staff Committee and to submit a recommendation for further action to the General Assembly.
