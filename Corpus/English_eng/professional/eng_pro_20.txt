PROTOCOL ON CERTAIN PROVISIONS RELATING TO DENMARK AS REGARDS ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT that the Danish Constitution contains provisions which may imply a referendum in Denmark prior to Denmark renouncing its exemption;
GIVEN THAT, on 3 November 1993, the Danish Government notified the Council of its intention not to participate in the third stage of economic and monetary union, under the terms of paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark, annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
HAVE AGREED upon the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe:
Article 1
In view of the notice given to the Council by the Danish Government on 3 November 1993, Denmark shall have an exemption.
The effect of the exemption shall be that all provisions of the Constitution and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and the European Central Bank referring to a derogation shall be applicable to Denmark.
Article 2
As for the abrogation of the exemption, the procedure referred to in Article III-198 of the Constitution shall only be initiated at the request of Denmark.
Article 3
In the event of abrogation of the exemption status, the provisions of this Protocol shall cease to apply.
