Decision of the Committee
The Fifth Committee, having considered the statement of programme budget implications submitted by the Secretary-General and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, decides to inform the General Assembly that should it adopt draft resolution A/59/L.69/Rev.1, additional resources of up to $116,300 would be required under section 1, Overall policymaking, direction and coordination, of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005.
As noted in paragraph 11 of the statement by the Secretary-General, every effort would be made to accommodate these requirements within the appropriation for the biennium; and the actual costs, if any, would be reported in the context of the second performance report for the biennium 2004-2005.
Having considered the detailed recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Fifth Committee also decides to inform the General Assembly that the adoption of the draft resolution would also give rise to additional resource requirements of up to $823,300 under section 1, Overall policymaking, direction and coordination (for the Office of the President of the General Assembly) and up to $60,300 under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007.
These additional requirements would be considered by the General Assembly in the context of its review of the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007.
