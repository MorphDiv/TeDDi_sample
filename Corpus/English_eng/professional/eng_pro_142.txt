Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 136
Financing of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone
Performance report on the budget of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004
Report of the Secretary-General
Corrigendum
Paragraph 10
The paragraph should read
The reduced requirements resulted from a lower actual 12-month average troop strength of 11,491 compared to the budgeted 12-month average troop strength of 12,740.
The budget (see A/57/681, issued on 18 December 2002) for the period concerned was prepared in accordance with the plan for downsizing the military component of the Mission as outlined by the Secretary-General in paragraphs 28 to 32 of his report to the Security Council dated 5 September 2002 (S/2002/987), which was endorsed by the Council in its resolution 1436 (2002).
During the period, the Mission commenced a faster pace of drawdown and withdrawal of the military force in accordance with the four-stage modified status quo drawdown plan, as endorsed by the Council in its resolution 1492 (2003) of 18 July 2003, which envisaged a complete withdrawal of the peacekeeping troops by December 2004.
The lower average troop strength resulted in reduced requirements for standard troop cost reimbursement, rotation and repatriation travel of military contingent members, rations, recreational leave and daily allowance for troops, and deployment of contingent-owned equipment.
