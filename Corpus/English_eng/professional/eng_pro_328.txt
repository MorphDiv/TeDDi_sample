Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 24
Prevention of armed conflict
Letter dated 25 July 2005 from the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly
In a letter (A/59/877) dated 24 March 2005, recently delivered to the Office of the President of the General Assembly, the Gambia and a very small number of other countries wantonly distorted the Anti-Secession Law passed by the National People's Congress (NPC) of the People's Republic of China.
The Chinese Government and people strongly condemn and firmly oppose this act of brazen interference in China's internal affairs.
Upon instructions of my Government, I hereby solemnly state our position as follows:
China's NPC has a clearly defined purpose in enacting the Anti-Secession Law, namely, to oppose and check Taiwan's secession from China by secessionists in the name of “Taiwan independence”, promote peaceful national reunification, maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, preserve China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and safeguard the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation.
This legislation has clearly identified the nature of the Taiwan question, codified the Chinese Government's basic guidelines on the Taiwan question as well as the major policies and important propositions on this issue that it has implemented or advanced over the years, and harmonized the principles and guidelines on the settlement of the Taiwan question in an integrated fashion.
The provisions of the law give full expression to our consistent position on and proposal for the prospect of peaceful reunification, sought with utmost effort and maximum sincerity, and at the same time they demonstrate the common will of the entire Chinese people to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Facts have shown that this is a law designed to bring about peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question and achieve peaceful national reunification.
It is by no means a “law on the use of force against Taiwan”, still less a “mobilization order”.
It does not include a timetable for reunification.
We have sufficient patience in developing cross-Straits relations and realizing peaceful reunification.
To realize the complete reunification of the country through peaceful means is the common aspiration of the entire Chinese people.
For a long time, the Chinese Government has made unremitting efforts for a peaceful reunification of the motherland.
Resolving the Taiwan question through peaceful means and realizing peaceful national reunification serves the fundamental interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits as well as the entire Chinese nation, and conforms to the trend of peace and development in the present-day world.
This law unequivocally stipulates that “the State shall do its utmost with maximum sincerity to achieve a peaceful reunification”.
It also provides for efforts to encourage and promote personnel exchanges as well as economic and cultural interactions between the two sides, facilitate the three direct links and protect the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots.
It also provides for consultations and negotiations between the two sides of the Straits, which makes it clear that anything can be discussed as long as the one-China principle is adhered to, and so on and so forth.
This will facilitate the implementation of provisions therein by government departments and relevant institutions and organizations in the interest of an all-round development of cross-Straits relations and peaceful reunification of the two sides.
In recent years, significant and complex changes have taken place on the island of Taiwan.
The “Taiwan independence” secessionists have intensified their activities, causing serious impact on the peaceful and stable development of cross-Straits relations.
This has increasingly become the biggest obstacle to the growth of cross-Straits relations as well as the biggest immediate threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.
At present, there have emerged some new positive factors in the cross-Straits relations that are helpful in checking the secessionist activities by “Taiwan independence” forces, and there have been certain signs of relaxation of tension in the Straits.
Nevertheless, the “Taiwan independence” forces have not stopped their secessionist activities and the root cause for tension in cross-Straits relations has yet to be eliminated.
In view of the immense destructiveness of the secessionist activities in the name of “Taiwan independence” to cross-Straits relations and the severe threat they pose to peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and the Asia-Pacific region at large, the Anti-Secession Law provides for taking non-peaceful means to stop Taiwan's secession from China by the “Taiwan independence' forces.
It must be pointed out here that we are willing to strive for peaceful reunification with utmost effort and maximum sincerity.
Nevertheless, no sovereign State can tolerate secession.
Non-peaceful means of stopping Taiwan's secession from China by the “Taiwan independence” forces will be used only as the last resort and only when our efforts for a peaceful reunification prove totally futile.
We have enacted this law precisely to prevent this unfortunate situation from happening between the two sides.
Therefore, the Anti-Secession Law is of great importance for opposing and checking the reckless secessionist activities in the name of “Taiwan independence”, and to maintaining peace, stability and prosperity in the Taiwan Straits and the Asia-Pacific region.
The Anti-Secession Law is a domestic law of China, and a defensive measure for safeguarding State sovereignty and territorial integrity and for enabling a prospect of peaceful reunification.
Taiwan is part of Chinese territory and has never been a State.
Though the two sides of the Taiwan Straits are not yet reunified, the status of the mainland and Taiwan belonging to one and the same China has never changed.
Such is the status quo of cross-Straits relations.
The Taiwan authorities have tried to change that status quo through “de jure Taiwan independence”, which is what we can never tolerate.
By enacting this law, we aim to maintain the status quo that both Taiwan and the mainland belong to one and the same China.
We have noticed that the overwhelming majority of countries in the world understand and support this piece of legislation.
We have also noticed the responses from different quarters in Taiwan.
We are not a bit surprised by the malicious attacks from the Taiwan authorities and various secessionist forces in Taiwan, because the law has a clear-cut objective, that is, to oppose and check Taiwan's secession from China by the “Taiwan independence” forces.
If the Taiwan authorities do not engage in secessionist activities in the name of “Taiwan independence”, as they have openly promised, then they should have no reason to fear, worry, or oppose this legislation.
It is the “Taiwan independence” secessionist activities perpetrated by the Taiwan authorities that are the real source of tension in the Taiwan Straits.
It has been our consistent proposition that the Taiwan question be resolved through peaceful means on the basis of the one-China principle.
Even if there is only a glimmer of hope for peaceful reunification, we will do our utmost to realize it.
We have always stood for dialogue and negotiation between the two sides on the basis of the one-China principle.
We welcome the efforts of any individual or political party in Taiwan towards the recognition of the one-China principle.
We are willing to talk with any individual or political party, regardless of their past rhetoric and actions, about issues concerning development of cross-Straits relations and promotion of peaceful reunification, as long as they recognize the one-China principle and the 1992 consensus.
Not long ago, Mr. Lien Chan, Chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang Party, and Mr. James Soong, Chairman of the People First Party, paid successful visits to the mainland at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mr. Hu Jintao, General Secretary.
Mr. Yu Mu-ming, Chairman of the New Party, also visited the mainland recently.
General Secretary Hu held formal talks with each of them respectively, during which the two sides had a sincere, frank and in-depth exchange of views on major issues relating to cross-Straits relations and inter-party ties.
As such visits may help move cross-Straits relations towards peace and stability, serve the common interests of people on both sides of the Straits and conform to the aspiration of Taiwan compatriots for peace, stability and development, they have received extensive support from people on both sides of the Straits and won full recognition by the international community.
We will continue to promote the three direct links, economic cooperation and all other exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
We will exert our utmost effort to do, and do well, everything that benefits our Taiwan compatriots, cross-Straits exchanges, peace in the Taiwan Straits and peaceful reunification of the motherland.
Since early this year, we have adopted a number of specific measures to help and benefit Taiwan compatriots.
we have the confidence and sincerity in and patience for better communication and mutual understanding with Taiwan compatriots, a bright prospect for cross-Straits relations and mutual benefit and a win-win situation for both sides, through extensive exchanges, close cooperation and mutual accommodation.
Respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in a country's internal affairs stand as important principles of the Charter of the United Nations long cherished by all countries in the world.
China has strictly followed these principles in managing its relations with other countries.
What the Gambia and a very small number of other countries have done this time constitutes a violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
We strongly urge these countries to strictly abide by the above-mentioned principles, to refrain from doing anything further that may provide support to “Taiwan independence” secessionists in their attempts to split Taiwan from China, and to adopt the same position on the Taiwan question as the great majority of Member States.
We highly appreciate the one-China position adopted by the United Nations and the great majority of its Member States and their support for China's cause of peaceful reunification.
We are confident that we, the Chinese Government and people, will continue to enjoy understanding of and extensive support for our just cause of safeguarding State sovereignty and territorial integrity and promoting peaceful reunification of the motherland.
I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly under item 24 of its agenda.
(Signed) Wang Guangya Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations
