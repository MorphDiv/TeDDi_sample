Since the terms of office of Mr. Gurgel de Alencar Netto, Mr. Logutov, Mr. Meijerman, Mr. Park, Mr. Sessi and Mr. Wu will expire on 31 December 2005, it will be necessary for the General Assembly at its sixtieth session to appoint six persons to fill the resulting vacancies.

At previous sessions, the Fifth Committee submitted to the General Assembly a draft decision containing the names of the persons recommended for appointment.
It is suggested that a similar procedure be followed at the sixtieth session.
