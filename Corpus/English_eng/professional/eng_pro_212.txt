Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 55
Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit
Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit
Note by the Secretary-General
* The report of the Millennium Project is being reproduced in all languages, as received.
Three years ago, I commissioned Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs, my special adviser on the Millennium Development Goals, to undertake an ambitious piece of research to map out how those important Goals, based on the Millennium Declaration, could be achieved.
Supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on behalf of the United Nations Development Group, Professor Sachs put together a very distinguished group of 10 dedicated task forces made up of 265 of the world's leading development experts.
I am very pleased to be able to transmit to the Member States, in all official languages, the overview of the Millennium Project's final report, Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
I believe this is an important document.
It draws on wide-ranging consultations across all continents and representing thousands of pages of detailed analysis in the separate reports produced by each task force.
It is a major intellectual achievement and offers a large number of concrete, practical proposals for reaching the Millennium Development Goals by the agreed target year of 2015.
As the report makes clear, the Goals are not utopian.
They are eminently achievable.
Many countries, including some of the poorest and least developed, are making real progress in achieving them.
But many others, particularly in Africa, are not moving fast enough.
The recommendations in the report offer ways to help those who have fallen behind, as well as those who are looking to build on their gains.
Member States are already engaged in very serious, in-depth discussions on some of the most important issues and dilemmas facing the international community as part of the preparations for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly, which is to be held in New York from 14 to 16 September 2005 to review progress towards the Goals and in the implementation of all aspects of the Millennium Declaration.
I regard this report, like that of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, as a very important contribution to that process, and to my own report on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, which I hope to submit to you in March.
It is my sincere hope that the September summit will produce bold and far-reaching decisions, and that we can work together to put in place the building blocks of a safer, more prosperous and fairer world.
I would also like to thank Professor Sachs and his team and the chairs and members of the task forces for their commitment to that goal and for all the hard work they have done.
