Report of the Secretary-General

Mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Sudan
The United Nations Advance Mission in the Sudan (UNAMIS) was established as a special political mission pursuant to Security Council resolution 1547 (2004) of 11 June 2004 for an initial period of three months.
This was against the background of expectations that a peacekeeping operation would later be mandated by the Council.
In its resolutions 1556 (2004), 1574 (2004), 1585 (2005) and 1588 (2005), the Council extended the mandate of UNAMIS until, respectively, 10 December 2004, 10 March 2005, 17 March 2005 and 24 March 2005.
The General Assembly has approved financial resources for UNAMIS in the amount of $49,362,400.
In its resolution 1547 (2004), in addition to establishing UNAMIS, the Security Council also requested the Secretary-General to take the necessary preparatory steps, including, in particular, pre-positioning the most critical logistical and personnel requirements to facilitate the rapid deployment of a possible peace support operation.
In this regard, on 30 July 2004, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions granted commitment authority in the amount of $49,999,400 to meet the cost of the most immediate and essential preparatory steps for the pre-positioning of critical logistical and personnel requirements.
In its resolution 1590 (2005), the Security Council established the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), and, in paragraph 10 of the same resolution, requested that the Secretary-General transfer all functions performed by the special political mission in the Sudan (UNAMIS) to UNMIS, together with staff and logistics of the office as appropriate, on the same day.
On 28 March 2005, following the establishment of UNMIS, the Controller requested the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions for an additional commitment authority in the amount of $50 million for the most immediate and essential start-up requirements for 30 days to enable the rapid establishment and deployment of the Mission.
The main steps in the process leading to the establishment of UNMIS are summarized in the table below:
According to the mandate of UNMIS, outlined in paragraph 4 of Security Council resolution 1590 (2005), the Mission has been established in order to: support implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement; facilitate and coordinate, within its capabilities and in its areas of deployment, the voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons and humanitarian assistance, inter alia, by helping to establish the necessary security conditions; assist the parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in cooperation with other international partners in the mine action sector, by providing humanitarian de-mining assistance, technical advice and coordination; and contribute towards international efforts to protect and promote human rights in the Sudan, as well as coordinate international efforts towards the protection of civilians, with particular attention to vulnerable groups, including internally displaced persons, returning refugees and women and children, within the Mission's capabilities and in close cooperation with other United Nations agencies, related organizations and non-governmental organizations.
As indicated in paragraph 1 of resolution 1590 (2005), the authorized strength of UNMIS will consist of up to 10,000 military personnel and 715 civilian police.
The detailed budgets for UNMIS for the periods from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 and from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, including the justification of posts and operational costs, are currently being prepared and will be submitted to the General Assembly by the end of May 2005.
Pending the consideration of the complete budgets by the General Assembly during the main part of its sixtieth session in October 2005, immediate cash resources and temporary posts for the period from 1 April to 31 October 2005 are required for the establishment of the Mission and for its rapid deployment.
In this context, the civilian staff posts included in this commitment authority, with assessment, are all provisional and without prejudice to approval by the Assembly in October 2005.
Accordingly, in the present report, the Secretary-General is requesting commitment authority, with assessment, in the amount of $595,498,500 to meet the operating costs of UNMIS until 31 October 2005, inclusive of the total amount of $49,999,400 previously authorized by the Advisory Committee and the $50,000,000 additional commitment authority requested from the Advisory Committee on 28Â March 2005.
This request is proposed in accordance with the provision of section IV, paragraph 2, of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A and includes requirements for the above-mentioned transfer of personnel and assets from the United Nations Advance Mission in the Sudan (UNAMIS) to UNMIS.

Rental accommodation is also provided for military staff officers and other military personnel in Khartoum on an interim basis while hard wall accommodations are constructed.

The provision also includes the amount of $19,749,100 for the replenishment of the strategic deployment stocks for spare parts, vehicles and workshop equipment for the Mission.
For the internal movement of personnel and transportation of cargo, the supply and resupply of the sector headquarters and team sites throughout the country, medical and casualty evacuation and military tasks, including the deployment of a quick-response force, the Mission proposes to establish an aircraft fleet of 17 fixed-wing and 33 rotary aircraft for the period ending 31 October 2005, inclusive of rental of 16 fixed-wing and 21 helicopters for the period from 1 April to 30 June 2005.
Given the vast size of the Sudan and the inadequate road infrastructure in most areas of the country, the movement of personnel and transportation of cargo will depend, to a large extent, on the air-lift capacity of UNMIS.
Furthermore, the inherent danger and risk from the presence of unmarked mines in many roads make ground transportation a less viable option for the movement of personnel and cargo.
The provision includes rental costs ($63,812,400), liability insurances ($6,070,800) and fuel ($40,054,000) for the air fleet.
