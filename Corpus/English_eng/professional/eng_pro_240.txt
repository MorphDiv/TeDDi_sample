Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Mandate and planned results
The mandate of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) was established by Security Council resolution 1528 (2004) of 27 February 2004 for an initial period of 12 months as from 4 April 2004.
In paragraph 2 of its resolution 1584 (2005) of 1 February 2005, the Council authorized UNOCI to monitor the implementation of arms embargo measures imposed in its resolution 1572 (2004) of 15 November 2004 and to collect and dispose of arms and any related material brought into Côte d'Ivoire in violation of these measures.
The Operation is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, the re-establishment of peace, security and long-term stability in Côte d'Ivoire.
Within this overall objective, the Operation will, during the budget period, contribute to a number of expected accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below.
These frameworks are grouped by components, derived from the mandate of the Operation contained in paragraph 6 of Security Council resolution 1528 (2004), namely: ceasefire; disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement; humanitarian and human rights; peace process; and law and order, and also include a support component.
The expected accomplishments would lead to the fulfilment of the Security Council's objective within the lifetime of the Operation, and the indicators of achievement show a measurement of progress towards such accomplishments during the budget period.
The human resources of UNOCI in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the Operation's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Operation as a whole.
Variances in the number of personnel, compared to the 2004/05 budget, have been explained under the respective components.
Pursuant to paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 59/16 of 29 October 2004, the present report includes the rejustification, under the executive direction and management and relevant frameworks components, of the following posts: Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Coordination, Recovery and Reconstruction; Chief of the Communications and Public Information Office; Director in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General; Principal Legal Adviser; Special Assistant to the Special Representative; Spokesperson; and two Protocol Officers (one Professional and one National Officer).
The rejustification also reflects the results of the post grade-level review undertaken by the Operation and includes the proposed abolition of the post of the Special Assistant to the Special Representative (P-5) and downgrading of the posts of Principal Legal Adviser (D-1 to P-5), Spokesperson (P-5 to P-4) and Associate Protocol Officer (P-2 to National Officer).
UNOCI is headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the Under-Secretary-General level, assisted by a Principal Deputy Special Representative and a Deputy Special Representative, both at the level of Assistant Secretary-General.
Military operations are headed by a Force Commander at the D-2 level, while a Police Commissioner at the D-1 level heads the civilian police component of the Operation.
The headquarters for the Operation has been established in Abidjan, with two sector headquarters located in Bouake (Sector East) and Daloa (Sector West) and a forward logistics base in Yamoussoukro.
UNOCI provides administrative, logistical and technical support to its substantive, military and civilian police personnel deployed in Abidjan, Sectors East and West and 71 field locations throughout the country.
Executive direction and management
Overall mission direction and management are to be provided by the immediate Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
Since outputs related to the responsibilities of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Operations and Rule of Law and the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Coordination, Recovery and Reconstruction are reflected in more than one framework component, their immediate offices are also shown under the above heading.

Analysis of variances
• Management: full deployment of military observers
The main factor contributing to the variance of $1,054,200 under this heading is the projected full deployment of the Operation's authorized strength of 200 military observers during the budget period, compared with the phased deployment during the 2004/05 period.
A 3 per cent turnover factor has been applied to the computation of mission subsistence allowance for the 2005/06 period, compared with the 10 per cent delayed deployment factor applied with respect to the 2004/05 period.
• Management: full deployment of contingent personnel
The main factor contributing to the variance of $1,569,600 under this heading is the projected full deployment of the Operation's authorized strength of 6,040 contingent personnel during the budget period, compared with the phased deployment during the 2004/05 period.
A 3 per cent turnover factor has been applied to the computation of cost estimates for the 2005/06 period, compared with the 5 per cent delayed deployment factor applied with respect to the 2004/05 period.
• Management: full deployment of civilian police personnel
The main factor contributing to the variance of $2,521,200 under this heading is the projected full deployment of the Operation's authorized strength of 345 police personnel (excluding the Civilian Police Commissioner and four police officers, provision for which is made in the international staff category) during the budget period, compared with the phased deployment during the 2004/05 financial period.
A 15 per cent delayed deployment factor has been applied with respect to the computation of mission subsistence allowance.
• Management: increased inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $14,095,500 under this heading is the projected deployment during the budget period of all international staff approved for the 2004/05 period (compared with their phased deployment during that period), combined with a provision for the proposed 41 additional staff based on their phased deployment.
The estimated requirements reflect the application of a 20 per cent turnover factor and are based, given that the Operation was established in April 2004, on salary and staff assessment rates derived from the actual average expenditure by staff category and grade levels in the 2003/04 financial period across all peacekeeping operations (excluding the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and established missions).
Common staff costs have been estimated at 83 per cent of net salary for international staff, including provision for hazardous duty station allowance.
• Management: increased inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $2,095,900 under this heading is the projected deployment during the budget period of all national staff approved for the 2004/05 period (compared with their phased deployment during that period), combined with the provision for the proposed 70 additional staff based on their deployment in January 2006.
The estimated resource requirements are based on the G-4 step VI, and NO-B, step V, salary, staff assessment and common staff costs of the national staff salary scales in effect from 1 June 2002.
The estimated resource requirements reflect the application of a 15 per cent turnover factor.
• Management: increased inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $1,368,200 under this heading is the projected deployment during the budget period of all United Nations Volunteers approved for the 2004/05 period (compared with their phased deployment during that period), combined with the provision for the proposed 10 additional volunteers based on their deployment in January 2006.
A turnover factor of 20 per cent has been applied in the computation of United Nations Volunteer costs.
• Management: increased inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $49,900 under this heading is the projected deployment during the budget period of all eight government-seconded Corrections Officers approved for the 2004/05 period, compared with their phased deployment during that period.
A 10 per cent turnover factor has been applied in the computation of mission subsistence allowance for the Corrections Officers.
• Management: reduced inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $44,300 under this heading is the reduced requirements for consultant services compared with the 2004/05 financial period.
• Management: reduced inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $436,400 under this heading is the reduction of official travel and training-related travel requirements for the 2005/06 financial period compared with the 2004/05 period.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $10,979,100 under this heading is the significant reduction in requirements for the 2005/06 financial period with respect to the acquisition of various items of equipment, including prefabricated facilities, electrical, refrigeration and security and safety equipment, generators and fuel tanks and pumps, provision for which has been made in the 2004/05 period, as well as reduced requirements for utilities and construction services.
The overall reductions in requirements were partially offset by the increase in requirements for maintenance services as well as self-sustainment, owing to the projected full deployment of military personnel.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $16,231,700 under this heading is the significant reduction in requirements for the acquisition of vehicles and workshop equipment in the 2005/06 financial period, provision for which has been made in the 2004/05 period.
The cost estimates provide for the purchase of additional vehicles in connection with the proposed increases in the staffing establishment of the Operation.
• Management: increased inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $16,017,100 under this heading is the projected deployment of the Operation's approved fleet of 14 aircraft, consisting of two fixed-wing aircraft and 12 helicopters by July 2005, compared with their phased deployment during the 2004/05 period.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $10,440,200 under this heading is the significant reduction of requirements for the acquisition of communications equipment in the 2005/06 financial period, provision for which has been made in the 2004/05 period, offset in part by increased requirements for public information services owing to the implementation of the Operation's expanded public information programmes in the 2005/06 period.
The cost estimates provide only for the replacement of communications equipment to be written off during the budget period and the acquisition of additional public information equipment.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $2,918,800 under this heading is the significant reduction of requirements for the acquisition of information technology equipment in the 2005/06 financial period, provision for which has been made in the 2004/05 period.
The cost estimates provide for the replacement of equipment to be written off during the budget period, as well as for additional equipment for the Geographic Information System.
• Management: increased inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $244,400 under this heading is the increased requirements for medical supplies and services and self-sustainment in connection with the projected full deployment of military and civilian personnel in the 2005/06 financial period, compared with their phased deployment in the 2004/05 period.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $588,600 under this heading is the discontinuation of requirements for the acquisition of observation equipment, provision for which has been made in the 2004/05 financial period.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $4,214,100 under this heading is the significant reduction in requirements for freight and related costs for the transportation of United Nations-owned equipment, as well as for various items of equipment in the 2005/06 financial period, provision for which has been made in the 2004/05 period.
• Management: increased inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $200,000 under this heading is the Operation's planned implementation of the expanded programme of quick-impact projects to promote and facilitate the United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Côte d'Ivoire.
These projects will focus primarily on areas such as education, health, enhancement of water facilities and sanitation.
Expenditure report for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004
The budget for the establishment of the Operation for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004 was set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 7 May 2004 (A/58/788) and amounted to $101,061,200 gross ($100,200,000 net).

On the basis of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions contained in paragraph 44 of its report dated 19 May 2004 (A/58/806), the General Assembly, by its resolution 58/310 of 18 June 2004, appropriated the amount of $96,368,100 gross ($95,601,200 net) for the establishment of the Operation for the period from 4 April to 30 June 2004.
This amount has been assessed on Member States.
Financial resources
(Thousands of United States dollars.
Budget period is from 4 April to 30 June 2004.
Analysis of variances
The variance of $204,400 under this heading is attributable primarily to faster deployment of military observers during the reporting period.
While it was planned that an average of 121 observers would be deployed during the period, actual strength averaged 126 military observers.
The variance of $6,632,900 under this heading is attributable to slower deployment of contingent personnel during the reporting period.
While it was planned that an average of 3,536 contingent personnel would be deployed during the period, actual troop strength averaged 3,061 personnel.
The variance of $1,233,100 under this heading is attributable to slower deployment of police personnel during the reporting period.
While it was planned that an average of 138 police would be deployed during the period, actual strength averaged 47 civilian police.
The variance of $405,100 under this heading is attributable primarily to the lower incumbency levels with respect to international staff during the reporting period.
While it was planned that an average of 198 international staff would be deployed during the period, actual deployment averaged 133 staff.
The variance of $510,900 under this heading is attributable to the lower incumbency levels with respect to national staff during the reporting period.
While it was planned that an average of 213 national staff would be deployed during the period, actual deployment averaged 118 staff.
The variance of $617,100 under this heading is attributable to the delayed deployment of United Nations Volunteers during the reporting period.
While the deployment of an average of 76 United Nations Volunteers was planned for the period, actual deployment averaged 15 Volunteers.
The variance of $29,000 under this heading is attributable to the non-implementation of cultural-awareness and negotiation and conflict-resolution training courses and the non-utilization of consultants with respect to French-language and advanced information-technology training courses held during the reporting period.
The variance of $483,900 under this heading is attributable to the reduced requirements for travel to training locations outside of the mission area during the start-up phase of the Operation, as well as to the reduction of official travel from United Nations Headquarters to UNOCI.
The variance of $914,600 under this heading is attributable primarily to delays in the establishment of the Operation's accommodation and office facilities owing to difficulties in identifying suitable premises at all locations, which resulted in reduced requirements for alteration, renovation and construction services as well as utilities.
Furthermore, owing to the long lead time required for the acquisition of security and safety equipment, the procurement process could not be completed before 30 June 2004, resulting in additional savings.
The savings were partially offset by the acquisition of additional hardwall modular buildings and semi-hardwall structures in order to provide short-term facilities (office and residential accommodation) pending identification of and contracting for suitable premises.
The variance of $1,434,300 under this heading is attributable primarily to the expedited acquisition of vehicles and workshop equipment, offset in part by savings in respect of petrol, oil and lubricants owing to a lower than projected number of deployed vehicles and delays in finalizing the fuel contract.
The variance of $1,376,200 under this heading is attributable primarily to delayed deployment of the Operation's air assets during the reporting period.
While it was anticipated that six aircraft (four helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft) would be deployed, two aircraft (one helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft) were actually deployed during the reporting period.
The variance of $2,121,000 under this heading is attributable to the long lead time required for the acquisition of some items of communications and public-information equipment, in respect of which the procurement process could not be completed before 30 June 2004.
The variance of $284,700 under this heading is attributable primarily to the long lead time required for the acquisition of some items of information-technology equipment, in respect of which the procurement process could not be completed before 30 June 2004.
The variance of $203,400 under this heading is attributable primarily to delayed acquisition of blood and blood supplies owing to the long importation process.
The variance of $178,300 under this heading is attributable to the long lead time required for the acquisition of observation equipment (binoculars, laser range finders and night-vision devices), in respect of which the procurement process could not be completed before 30 June 2004.
The variance of $208,900 under this heading is attributable primarily to the higher actual expenditures in connection with the transportation of the United Nations-owned equipment, including inland transportation and the recording under this heading of the cost of a 14-day rations reserve stock transferred from UNAMSIL.
The variance of $162,300 under this heading is attributable to the limited implementation of quick-impact projects by the Operation owing to the short time available for the identification and approval of such projects during the reporting period.
Actions to be taken by the General Assembly
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNOCI are:
(a) To appropriate the amount of $371,835,600, for the maintenance of the Operation for the 12-month period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006;

The total resource requirements for UNOCI for the financial period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 have been linked to the mission's objective through a number of results-based frameworks, grouped by components: ceasefire; disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement; humanitarian and human rights; peace process; and law and order, as well as support.
The human resources of the mission in terms of number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the mission as a whole.
The explanations of variances in resource levels, both human resources and financial resources, have been linked, where applicable, to specific outputs planned by the mission.
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 59/16 of 29 October 2004 on the financing of UNOCI, the present report includes the rejustification, under the executive direction and management and relevant frameworks components, of the posts identified in paragraph 9 of the resolution, including proposed grade-level adjustments, where applicable.

Reference
The present section describes the single largest contributing factor of each resource variance according to specific standard options encompassed in the four standard categories listed below:
Mandate:Variances caused by changes in the scale or scope of the mandate, or changes in the expected accomplishments as driven by the mandate; External:Variances caused by parties or situations external to the United Nations; Cost parameters:Variances caused by United Nations regulations, rules and policies; Management:Variances caused by management actions to achieve planned results more effectively (e.g. by reprioritizing or adding certain outputs) or efficiently (e.g. by taking measures to reduce personnel or operational inputs while maintaining the same level of outputs), and/or from performance related issues (e.g. by having underestimated the costs or quantities of inputs required to produce a certain level of outputs, or by delayed recruitment).
