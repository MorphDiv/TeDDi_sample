Annex to the letter dated 6 May 2005 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
Message from Russian Federation President V.
V. Putin to the participants in the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
I send my greetings to all the participants and guests at the Conference.
Your representative forum is devoted to a vital topic — the review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
The Russian Federation, as a State party to the Treaty and one of its depositaries, regards this instrument as an important component of the international security system.
For thirty-five years, it has proven its effectiveness, above all in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.
The new threats to the non-proliferation regime, including nuclear “black markets”, can and must be neutralized today precisely on the basis of the Treaty.
This work has already begun.
With our country's active participation, United Nations Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), which aims to prevent the transfer of hazardous materials to terrorists, was adopted, and the Group of Eight drew up the Action Plan on Non-Proliferation in 2004.
The Russian Federation is carrying out strictly all its obligations in the area of disarmament.
We have been successfully implementing agreements in this field, and we also stand ready to take further constructive steps.
We expect individual countries and the entire international community to become our partners in ensuring stability and security.
At the same time, we actively exercise the right to the peaceful use of atomic energy, enshrined in the Treaty, and we are cooperating with States parties to the Treaty in developing nuclear energy, peaceful nuclear research and the use of nuclear technologies.
I am confident that this forum will conduct an objective analysis of the operation of the Treaty.
The decisions adopted will be instrumental in defining specific measures to enhance its effectiveness.
I extend my best wishes for success to all the participants in the seventh Review Conference.
