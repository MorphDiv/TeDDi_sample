Financing of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone
Budget for the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006
* The submission date was delayed owing to additional substantive consultations.
Report of the Secretary-General*
Contents
Mandate and planned results
The mandate of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1270 (1999).
The most recent extension of the mandate was authorized by the Council in its resolution 1562 (2004) of 17 September 2004.
The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to consolidate peace and stability in Sierra Leone.
Within this overall objective, the Mission will, during the budget period, contribute to a number of expected accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below.
These frameworks are grouped by components: substantive civilian, military, civilian police and support.
The indicators of achievement show to what extent the objective and expected accomplishments have been fulfilled by 31 December 2005, when the Mission will close its substantive civilian, military and civilian police components.
The human resources of the Mission in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the Mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Mission as a whole.
Variances in the number of personnel, compared to the budget of 2004/05, including reclassifications, have been explained under the respective components.
The drawdown of UNAMSIL, adjustments to its size, composition and deployment in the maintenance period from 1 July to 31 December 2005 and in the subsequent liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 2006 are leading to changes in the structure and location of the Mission.
The Mission's headquarters continues to be based in Freetown and there will be two regional offices in Kenema and Murray Town, whereas in the 2004/05 budget period there were five regional offices in Kenema, Port Loko, Magburaka, Murray Town and Koidu.
The Mission will no longer have sector headquarters and the military will deploy in Kenema, Bo and Freetown, whereas in 2004/05 there were three sector headquarters.
There will be 11 team sites for the military observers and 10 team sites for the civilian police until 31 December 2005.
The substantive offices continue to deploy throughout Sierra Leone and the Mission area continues to include Conakry.
Executive direction and management
Overall Mission direction and management are to be provided by the immediate Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.

Human resources: executive direction and management
The net increase of three international staff posts relates to redeployment of posts to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the third quarter of the 2004/05 period (from 10 to 13 international staff posts), within the highest overall strength of 335 international staff posts for the entire period 2004/05.
This redeployment is described in the twenty-first report of the Secretary-General on UNAMSIL (S/2004/228, paras.
83 and 90) and concerns one Disarmament, Demobilization, Rehabilitation and Reintegration Adviser (P-4) from the DDR Management Unit, one Gender Adviser (P-4) from the Human Rights Office and one HIV/AIDS Adviser (P-4) from the Policy and Planning Section.
Component 1: substantive civilian
Table 2
Human resources: component 1, substantive civilian
The net decrease of a total of 63 posts, comprising 33 international staff posts, 15 national staff posts and 15 United Nations Volunteers posts, is a result of the downsizing and subsequent liquidation of the Mission.

This increase is described in the twenty-first report of the Secretary-General (ibid., para.

The organizational change resulted in a net decrease of five international staff posts, including one additional P-4 post relating to the deployment of a Regional Political Affairs Officer (P-4) for the Eastern Region.
This change is described in the twenty-first report of the Secretary-General (ibid., para.
Component 2: Military

Reference
The present section describes the single largest contributing factor of each resource variance according to specific standard options encompassed in the four standard categories listed below:
Mandate:variances caused by changes in the scale or scope of the mandate, or changes in the expected accomplishments as driven by the mandate;
External:variances caused by parties or situations external to the United Nations;
Cost parameters:variances caused by United Nations regulations, rules and policies;
Management:variances caused by management actions to achieve planned results more effectively (e.g., by reprioritizing or adding certain outputs) or efficiently (e.g., by taking measures to reduce personnel or operational inputs while maintaining the same level of outputs) and/or from performance-related issues (e.g., by having underestimated the costs or quantities of inputs required to produce a certain level of outputs, or by delayed recruitment)
