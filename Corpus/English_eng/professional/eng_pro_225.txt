Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) for the period from 1 July to 31 October 2005.
During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification.
The mandate of MONUC was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1291 (2000).
By its resolution 1565 (2004), the Council extended the deployment of MONUC until 31 March 2005 and authorized an increase of the Mission's strength by 5,900 personnel, including up to 341 civilian police personnel.
By its resolution 1592 (2005), the Council extended the mandate of MONUC until 1 October 2005, with the intention of renewing it for further periods.
The Security Council's decision was followed by the submission of revised estimates for MONUC which were considered by the Advisory Committee in March 2005.
In its related report (A/59/735), the Committee pointed to serious and significant problems in the report of the Secretary-General on revised estimates for MONUC.
The inadequacies identified by the Committee extended across the proposed revised budget, including requests for additional staffing as well as for additional operational resources.
It was made worse by an attempt to reflect in the revised budget the resource implications of a major reorganization, which the Mission is in the process of implementing.
The Committee drew attention to the fact that the Mission has not been able to develop a clear vision for its managerial structure or processes.
The Advisory Committee called for the Mission and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to review the civilian personnel requirements for MONUC, taking into account the observations of the Committee, as reflected in its report, and in the discussions held with the Committee.
The Committee stated its expectation that on the basis of the review, revised staffing requirements to be submitted in the proposed budget for the period 2005/06 should include a clear analysis of resources and capacities already available in the Mission, transparent justifications for new posts and explanations of the rationale behind redeployments and restructuring.
By its resolution 59/285 of 13 April 2005, the General Assembly approved revised appropriations of $954.8 million (gross) for MONUC for the period 2004/05.
It also endorsed the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on the revised 2004/05 budget for the Mission (A/59/735) and requested the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation.
In response to the report of the Advisory Committee and the resolution of the General Assembly, the Secretariat has announced its intention to undertake a thorough review of MONUC, its structure and requirements and to reflect the results in a comprehensive and well justified proposal for the period 2005/06.
Given the limited time available since the adoption of resolution 59/285, the Secretariat has indicated that it is not in a position to complete all the necessary analysis and work in time for the second resumed session of the Fifth Committee.
Pending submission to the General Assembly during the main part of its sixtieth session of a full budget for MONUC for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, including a results-based framework, the report of the Secretary-General contains a request for commitment authority of $383,187,800 (exclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions) to meet the operating requirements of MONUC from 1 July to 31 October 2005.
Assessment would be in two stages: $290,481,074, relating to the period from 1 July to 1 October 2005, and the balance of $92,706,726, relating to the period from 2 to 31 October 2005, will be assessed subject to the Security Council's decision to continue the mandate of MONUC beyond 1 October 2005.
The requested commitment authority of $383,187,800 would provide for the following:
• $138,740,900 under military and police personnel for the deployment of 760 military observers, 15,774 military contingent personnel (including 60 additional military contingent personnel within the revised strength authorized by the Security Council in its resolution 1565 (2004)) and 268 civilian police personnel
• $57,805,600 under civilian personnel for the deployment of 1,109 international and 1,549 national staff and 543 United Nations Volunteers, including 134 additional international staff and 194 additional national staff and 52 additional United Nations Volunteers
• $186,641,300 under operational costs.
The Advisory Committee emphasizes that it was not intended for the present request to provide the type of information which is necessary for a detailed consideration of the Mission's requirements, including staffing.
This request is merely to provide funding for the period during which the detailed budget proposals will be prepared and considered.
As indicated in paragraph 8 above, the present commitment authority request includes 328 additional posts (134 international staff and 194 national staff) and 52 United Nations Volunteer positions to support the Mission's expansion.
According to the Secretary-General, the “provisional establishment of these temporary posts” is requested without prejudice to the decision the General Assembly may take during the main part of its sixtieth session following the consideration of the proposed staffing establishment of the Mission for the 2005/06 financial period.
The Advisory Committee notes from supplementary information provided to it that it is the intention to fund the 134 additional “temporary international posts” from general temporary assistance; the 194 additional national staff are budgeted under national staff salaries.
In this connection, the Committee points out that all posts approved for peacekeeping missions are temporary in nature and the use of the term “temporary posts” to describe the resources now being requested should be avoided.
Moreover, the Committee points out that general temporary assistance does not fund established posts, whether permanent or temporary; general temporary assistance is used to pay for “positions” and/or short-term requirements for additional personnel.
The Committee concurs with the intention to utilize general temporary assistance to meet the requirements for 134 additional international positions pending submission of the MONUC budget for the period 2005/06.
It is of the opinion that additional national staff should also be provided for through general temporary assistance.
Care should be taken to avoid any implication that provision of resources in response to the Secretary-General's request for commitment authority in any way implies approval for the establishment of posts or the creation of new functions.
Such treatment would be consistent with the Advisory Committee's previously stated opinion that any additional staff provided to the Mission for urgent requirements does not prejudge any decision the General Assembly may take on the establishment of posts following its consideration of the proposed MONUC budget for the period 2005/06.
The Advisory Committee points out that the total commitment authority requested represents more than a straight prorating of the revised estimates recently approved by the General Assembly.
One reason for this is that the revised estimates reflect additional requirements related to the expansion of the Mission's mandate only since the approval of the revised mandate by the Security Council in October 2004 and thus do not reflect the full financial impact of the strengthened support component necessary for the expanded mandate.
Moreover, there are a number of one-time costs still to be incurred and a need to take advanced procurement action in view of the long lead time necessary for a number of items.
However, the Advisory Committee expects that the rigorous review of the Mission's structure and requirements, as called for by the General Assembly and promised by the Secretariat, will lead to streamlining and economies.
With regard to the requested operational requirements, the Committee points out that the programme of acquisition of vehicles, equipment and services should take account of the delays in deployment of Mission personnel.
Moreover, the Mission should prioritize its programmes of acquiring vehicles, equipment and services, which may reduce requirements during the four-month period for which commitment authority is sought.
In view of its observations and comments in the foregoing paragraphs, the Advisory Committee recommends that for the maintenance of the Mission from 1 July to 31 October 2005, the Secretary-General be granted commitment authority in the full amount of $383.2 million requested, but with an assessment of $350 million as follows:
(a) $265.3 million to be assessed for the period from 1 July to 1 October 2005;
(b) $84.7 million for the period from 2 to 31 October 2005 to be assessed, should the Security Council decide to continue the mandate of the Mission beyond 1 October 2005.
