Gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee has considered the report of the Secretary-General on gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities (A/59/716).
During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information.
The report is submitted in accordance with General Assembly resolution 57/281 B of 18 June 2003, by which the Secretary-General was requested to provide information on a biennial basis on the use of gratis personnel, indicating, inter alia, their nationality and duration of service, department where employed and functions performed.
The Advisory Committee notes that this is the first such report presented on a biennial basis.
The methodology for the compilation and statistical analysis of the data has also been modified to present the data on a cumulative basis for each calendar year, rather than presenting a snapshot of the situation at the end of the reporting period.
For both type I and type II personnel, details on the breakdown by department, nationality and gender are included, with information on category and functions performed.
As a result of the change of methodology and the new format, the Advisory Committee notes that the reports produced according to the previous methodology cannot be compared to the new report.
The report indicates a total of 1,149, of type I gratis personnel in 2003.
In 2004, the total number of type I personnel increased to 1,290 (A/59/716, table II).
Concerning type II personnel, the report shows a total of 53 in 2003 (A/59/716, table VII).
The total number increased to 85 in 2004 (ibid., table VIII).
The Advisory Committee notes that in 2003 and 2004 these personnel were hired for very short periods, often for under one month, almost exclusively by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for humanitarian work and relief operations following disasters such as floods and typhoons in Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Micronesia or Vanuatu, as well as the tsunami catastrophe at the end of 2004.
The Advisory Committee notes that this utilization of type II gratis personnel for short periods in the context of humanitarian emergencies is in line with the terms of General Assembly resolution 51/243 of 15 September 1997.
In its previous report on this subject (A/57/735) the Advisory Committee had recommended that information on gratis personnel be presented on a biennial basis in the context of the report on the composition of the Secretariat.
The Committee maintains that information concerning gratis personnel is a logical component of the report of the Secretary-General on the composition of the Secretariat.
It requests once again that in the future, details on gratis personnel be integrated into that report on a biennial basis, in the first year of the biennium.
The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly take note of the report of the Secretary-General (A/59/716).
