Agenda item 6
Election of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly
The Acting President (spoke in French): In accordance with rule 30 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, as amended by resolution 56/509 of 8 July 2002, we shall now proceed to the election of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly for its sixtieth session.
All members of the General Assembly are eligible in this election except those already represented in the General Committee, namely, those countries whose representatives have been elected to the presidency of the General Assembly or to the chairmanships of the Main Committees for the sixtieth session.
In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of the annex to resolution 33/138 of 19 December 1978, the 21 Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly for its sixtieth session shall be elected according to the following pattern: six representatives from African States; five representatives from Asian States; one representative from an Eastern European State; three representatives from Latin American and Caribbean States; one representative from a Western European or other State; and representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council.
In accordance with paragraph 16 of annex VI to the rules of procedure, the election of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly by secret ballot will be dispensed with when the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled.
We shall proceed accordingly.
I shall now read out the names of the endorsed candidates.
African States: Angola, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali and Tunisia.
Asian States: India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia, Myanmar and Pakistan.
Eastern European States: Armenia.
Latin American and Caribbean States: Brazil, Paraguay and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
Western European and other States: Israel.
Since the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled in each region, I declare those candidates elected, in addition to the representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council.
The following States have thus been elected to vice-presidencies of the General Assembly for its sixtieth session: Angola, Armenia, Brazil, the Central African Republic, China, France, Guinea-Bissau, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Kenya, Malaysia, Mali, Myanmar, Pakistan, Paraguay, the Russian Federation, Tunisia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the States that have been elected Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly for its sixtieth session.
With the Chairmen of the six Main Committees and the 21 Vice-Presidents elected for the sixtieth session of the General Assembly, the General Committee of the General Assembly for the sixtieth session has thus been fully constituted in accordance with rule 38 of the rules of procedure.
