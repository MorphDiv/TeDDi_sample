Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 130
Financing of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea
Budget for the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006
Report of the Secretary-General
Corrigendum
Page 2, summary
Add the following paragraph to the text of the summary:
It should be noted that the apportionment for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 excludes the amount of $7 million for the strengthening of the security and safety of the premises and staff of the Mission (see A/58/756, A/58/758, and General Assembly resolutions 58/295 and 58/302), as this is considered a one-time cost rather than a recurrent requirement for the maintenance of the Mission.
