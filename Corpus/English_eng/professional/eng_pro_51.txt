In order to ensure two-way communications, it is important for all members of the Executive Committee to maintain regular contact with the President and with their fellow members.
In particular, the following should be observed.
From Vice-presidents: To inform the President and the rest of the Executive Committee on salient issues arising in their sub-regions.
From other Executive Committee members: To provide timely inputs to the communications of their respective Vice-president.
Formal meetings of the Executive Committee
Subject to availability of funds, the Executive Committee should hold formal meetings at least once every six months to discuss broad policy issues and agree on strategies to deal with matters of particular importance to the Council.
Formal meetings of the Executive Committee should be convened in the various sub-regions on a rotational basis.
This will help to raise the profile of AMCOW in the sub-regions.
Ad hoc meetings of the Executive Committee
The President will convene ad hoc meetings with members of the Executive Committee whenever necessary to address pressing matters.
The President may request any Executive Committee member to host such meetings.
