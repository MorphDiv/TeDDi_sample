Annex I to the letter dated 5 July 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Jamaica to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
Doha Declaration
Adopted at the Second South Summit
Doha, 12-16 June 2005
We, the Heads of State and Government of the Member Countries of the Group of 77 and China, gathered in Doha, Qatar for the Second South Summit, from 14 to 16 June 2005, fully convinced of the imperative to continue to act in solidarity and unity for a peaceful and prosperous world that responds to our aspirations, reaffirm our full commitment to the spirit and principles of the Group of 77 and China, and to the protection and promotion of our collective interests in genuine international cooperation for development.
We reaffirm the Havana Declaration and the Programme of Action of the First South Summit, held in Havana, Cuba from 12 to 14 April 2000 and call for its full implementation.
We reaffirm that in our endeavours we are guided by all the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter and by full respect for the principles of international law.
To this end we uphold the principles of sovereignty and sovereign equality of States, territorial integrity and non intervention in the internal affairs of any State; take effective measures for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of peace and encourage the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered; refrain in international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other means inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations; develop friendly relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self determination of peoples; achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character; and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.
We emphasize that, while developing countries are committed to undertaking their international obligations, these undertakings may impose high costs, and that given the differences in the levels of development and the ability of countries to assume obligations, it is imperative that identical obligations are not forced on unequal participants.
We further emphasize the need to integrate the development dimensions into international rule making and that the international community must remain sensitive to this and take into account the need for flexibility and national policy space for countries while assuming international commitments.
We firmly reject the imposition of laws and regulations with extraterritorial impact and all other forms of coercive economic measures, including unilateral sanctions against developing countries and reiterate the urgent need to eliminate them immediately.
We emphasize that such actions not only undermine the principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nations and international law, but also severely threaten the freedom of trade and investment.
We, therefore, call on the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries.
We reaffirm the role of South-South cooperation in the overall context of multilateralism, as a continuing process vital to confront the challenges faced by the South, and as a valuable contribution to development, and the need to further strengthen it, including through enhancing the capacities of the institutions and the mechanisms that promote such cooperation.
We welcome the Marrakech Declaration and the Marrakech Framework for the Implementation of South-South Cooperation, which reaffirmed the commitment of the members to South-South cooperation and identified specific measures and initiatives to achieve this goal.
We are convinced that dialogue among civilizations should be a continuous process and that, in the current international environment, it is not an option but an imperative as a sound and productive tool to promote development to create a better life for all.
We recognize that the respect for religious and cultural diversity in an increasingly globalizing world contributes to international cooperation, promotes enhanced dialogue among religious, cultures and civilizations, and helps to create an environment conducive to exchange of human experience.
We acknowledge that good governance and the rule of law at the national and international levels are essential for sustained economic growth, sustainable development and eradication of poverty and hunger and that, inter alia, sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people, respect for all human rights, including the right to development, equity and transparency in the international financial, monetary and trading systems and full and effective participation of developing countries in global decision making and norm setting should also be pursued.
We recognize that the attainment of development is an objective of all stakeholders, including civil society, NGOs and private sectors.
While recognizing the primary responsibility of governments in the formulation and implementation of national strategy and policies for sustainable development, we emphasize the need to make efforts towards coordination and participation of all sectors of the society, according to domestic law, national priorities and national sovereignty, to enhance their contribution to sustained economic growth and sustainable development of our countries.
We recognize the increasing importance of South-South trade and economic cooperation; and the changing context of North-South interdependence and terms of engagement.
In this context, we call for a more energetic effort to deepen and revitalize South-South cooperation to take advantage of the new geography of international economic relations while recognizing this cooperation as complementary to and not substitute for North- South cooperation.
We emphasize that it is essential to adopt appropriate measures to overcome the technological gap between the developing and developed countries and to work towards arrangements that facilitate the processes of technology transfer.
We underscore the continuing relevance of the outcomes of all major United Nations conferences and summits and the commitments towards their implementation as constituting a coherent development agenda, and in this regard call on all countries to fulfill and implement all the commitments made at these conferences and summits.
We welcome the convening of the high level plenary meeting of the General Assembly, to be held in New York in September 2005, and urge the High Level Event to give high priority to development with a view to bring about a more equitable international economic system, and to enable developing countries to achieve their development objectives, and in this regard, further urge the high level plenary to undertake to:
Stress that each country has the sovereign right to determine its own development priorities and strategies and we call upon the international community to categorically reject any conditionality in the provision of development assistance.
Substantially increase resource flows to improve and promote domestic productive capacity of developing countries toward the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other international development goals, and in this regard emphasize the need to urgently meet the internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7% of donor countries' GNI, and within that target, to earmark 0.15 % to 0.20% for the LDCs, and, in order to ensure the efficacy of these efforts, the implementation of ODA commitments should be undertaken in a consistent, expeditious and transparent manner and also urge that the provision of official aid should respect the national development priorities of developing countries, and that it should be provided without conditionalities.
Target, in the context of development assistance, the improvement of the institutional and physical infrastructure facilities of developing countries to improve their environment for both domestic and foreign investment, thereby supporting their beneficial integration in the global economy.
Pursue the efforts to identify innovative sources of financing for development, capable of providing funding in a stable, predictable and on an additional basis to assist developing countries in the promotion of economic development and hunger and poverty eradication.
In this regard, due consideration should be given to all work being undertaken on this issue, particularly by the Technical Group on Innovative Financing Mechanisms established in the framework of the world leaders meeting on "Action on Hunger and Poverty", convened by the President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, which was held in New York in September 2004.
v. Operationalize the World Solidarity Fund and call upon donor countries, countries in a position to do so, international organizations, the private sector and individuals to contribute to the Fund in order to allow it to contribute to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals including the MDGs, particularly poverty eradication.
vi.
Emphasize the urgent need for the international community to adopt an effective, comprehensive, equitable, durable, and development-oriented solution to the debt problems of developing countries, particularly through total debt cancellation and increased concessional financial flows, as well as through debt swaps for sustainable development.
Provide debt relief to all developing countries, including debt cancellation to HIPC, as well as extending the HIPC initiative, and resolving the debt problems of LDCs, low- and middle-income developing countries that are not eligible to debt relief under the HIPC; and to explicitly link debt relief to the national development plans and efforts aimed at achieving the internationally agreed development goals including the MDGs, as well as other development goals.
There should also be an undertaking to review the debt sustainability criteria.
viii.
Promote an open, universal, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system that gives priority to the development dimension.
ix.
Ensure that the comparative advantage of developing countries is not undermined by any form of protectionism including the arbitrary and abusive use of non-tariff measures, non-trade barriers and other standards to unfairly restrict access of developing countries products into developed countries markets and reaffirm that developing countries should play an increasing role in the formulation of, inter alia, safety, environmental and health standards.
x.
Emphasize the importance of the strengthening and attainment of the universality of the WTO membership and, in this context, call for accelerating the accession process without political impediments, in an expeditious and transparent manner and with full observance of the principles of special and differential treatment for developing countries in particular LDCs applying to the WTO.
xi.
Emphasize that enhanced market access for goods and services of export interest to developing countries to the markets of developed countries, as well as special and differential treatment for the developing countries, balanced rules and well-targeted sustainably financed technical assistance and capacity-building programmes for developing countries are needed for the realization of the development dimension highlighted in the Doha work Programme, and commit to its successful conclusion consistent with the development needs and priorities of developing countries.
In this regard we further emphasize that the High Level plenary meeting of the General Assembly should give a strong message and provide clear direction for an expeditious conclusion of the Doha Round, which should ensure that the development dimension is kept in focus and should bring much needed benefits to developing countries in the area of trade.
Emphasize the need to provide an immediate solution to the question of commodities, and in this context, stress the need for a more effective international arrangement to address the problems of weak and volatile commodity prices, which pose a serious constraint on sustained development in a majority of developing countries.
Work expeditiously towards integrating the development dimensions in the rule making in the intellectual property regime that is development oriented and that facilitates the transfer of technology and knowledge to developing countries, and, in this context, to undertake to also work towards a legally binding international instrument on the preservation, protection and promotion of traditional knowledge and genetic resources.
Call for accelerating the negotiations on the development-related mandate concerning the TRIPS agreement in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, especially the amendments of TRIPS Agreement in order for intellectual property rules to fully support the objectives of the convention on Biological Diversity as well as trade-related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health to address the problems afflicting many developing including least developed countries, especially those resulting from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics.
Reform global economic and financial governance by ensuring effective participation of developing countries in international decision making and norm setting processes as well as by ensuring that global policies and processes in finance, trade, investment and technology are development oriented.
Enhance the capacity of the U.N. funds, programmes and agencies through increased, untied, unconditional and predictable contributions to their core resources to enable them to contribute more substantially to development-related activities, while simultaneously strengthen the intergovernmental oversight, particularly, with the involvement of developing countries, to ensure their responsiveness to development priorities and needs of developing countries.
We welcome the designation of the year 2006 as the International Year of Deserts and Desertification, and emphasize that the UNCCD constitutes an important tool for hunger and poverty eradication and a means to contribute to attaining the internationally agreed development goals including the MDGs.
We emphasize the need for ECOSOC to give due consideration to the needs and interests of developing countries in its consideration of the outcomes of its functional commissions and subsidiary bodies, particularly those related to the achievement of the MDGs, in the context of the preparation of inputs to their preparatory process of the High Level Plenary meeting of the General Assembly.
We stress the need for the Second High-Level Dialogue on Financing for Development, which is scheduled to be convened at the U.N. Headquarters on 27-28 June 2005, to also analyze the impact of structural conditionalities in our countries.
We stress the need to strengthen UNCTAD, the focal point within the United Nations for the integrated treatment of trade and development issues, as a vital component of the international economic system, to fully implement its mandate for policy analysis and policy advice, its indispensable role for forging consensus building on development matters, and its activities in technical assistance and capacity building.
In this regard, there is a need to ensure the full implementation of the Sao Paulo Consensus, and to build on it for an even stronger development focused mandate in UNCTAD XII.
We stress the need for international rules to allow policy space and policy flexibility for developing countries, as they are directly related to the development strategies of national governments.
We further emphasize the need for policy space to formulate development strategies that take into account national interests and differing needs of countries which are not always taken into account by international economic policy making in the process of integration with the global economy.
We recognize the intergovernmental nature of the United Nations and the universal, representative and democratic character of the General Assembly.
We also reaffirm the pertinent provisions of the Charter relating to the General Assembly and the necessity to ensure full respect for the role and responsibility of the General Assembly as enshrined in the Charter.
In this regard, we strongly support the reaffirmation in the Millennium Declaration of the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-making and representative organ of the United Nations as reiterated in UNGA resolution 58/317.
We attach high priority to the reform of the United Nations with the objective to strengthen the Organization, so that it can efficiently respond to the current and future challenges affecting the international community, in particular those concerns and interests of developing countries which constitute the vast majority of its membership.
We reaffirm that this process should be aimed at strengthening multilateralism, providing the Organization with a substantive capacity to fully and effectively meet the purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter, and at consolidating its democratic character and its transparency in the discussion and implementation of decisions of Member States.
We stress the importance of mainstreaming development dimension in the ongoing process of reform of the United Nations, bearing in mind the aim of enabling the full participation of peoples from the South in the international decision and rule-making economic processes and ensuring their access to and enjoyment of the benefits of international economy.
These objectives can only be achieved with a real political will.
Globalization presents opportunities, challenges and risks for developing countries.
We note with deep concern that the processes of globalization and liberalization have produced uneven benefits among and within countries and that the world economy has been characterized by slow and lopsided growth and instability.
The income gap between developed and developing countries has widened, and poverty has increased in many developing countries.
We therefore believe that there is a need for global strategy to prioritize the development dimension into global processes in order for developing countries to benefit from the opportunities offered by globalization.
An enabling external economic environment for development requires greater coherence between the international trading, monetary and financial systems.
We welcome the report of the World Commission on Social Dimension of Globalization and urge the General Assembly and other organs and bodies of the UN system to give full consideration to the proposals and recommendations contained therein with a view to contributing to make globalization inclusive and equitable for all world's people bearing in mind the conditions of developing countries, national development needs, priorities and policies.
We believe that restrictive business practices and monopoly rights exercised by global corporations and other entities often impede innovation, flow of information and technology, and that a major component of good governance at the international level should be good corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, which should address issues such as anti-competitive practices of larger market players including trans-national corporations; a fair balance between holders of intellectual property rights and public policy and societal goals; the need for access to knowledge, transfer of technology and FDI.
We reaffirm also the urgency, subject to national legislation, of recognizing the rights of local and indigenous communities that are holders of traditional knowledge, innovations and practices and, with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices, of developing and implementing benefit-sharing mechanisms on mutually agreed terms for the use of such knowledge, innovations and practices.
We reaffirm that South-South trade should be enhanced and further market access from developing countries must continue to stimulate South-South trade.
We welcome the launch of the Third Round of the GSTP as an important instrument to stimulate South-South trade.
In this regard, we invite all member countries of the GSTP to conclude the Third Round of GSTP by 2006 and encourage other members of the Group of 77 and China to consider participating in the GSTP.
We reiterate the decision of the First South Summit to strengthen cooperation in the monetary and financial fields and in this regard resolve to support South-South initiatives in this area.
We stress the need to strengthen the activities covered by the Second Account of the Common Fund for Commodities to support capacity building activities of commodity-dependent countries to diversify exports and enhance South-South trade through, financial and technical assistance, international assistance for economic diversification and sustainable resource management, and address the availability of commodity prices and declining terms of trade.
We recognize the important nexus between international migration and development and the need to deal with this issue in a coordinated and coherent manner with a view to addressing the challenges and opportunities that migration presents to countries of origin, destination and transit, thus deserving effective international cooperation in order to harness its positive effects.
We stress the importance of strengthening the knowledge and, scientific and technological capacities of developing countries, including the requisite upgrading of their human resources as a vital condition for attaining sustainable development and commit to promote and strengthen our cooperation in this regard.
We stress in particular the need to increase the capacity of developing countries in science and technology, including in information and communications technology and new and emerging technologies and, in this context, will work towards the effective participation of developing countries in all related fora, including the World Summit for Information Society to be held in Tunisia in November 2005.
We welcome the creation of the Digital Solidarity Fund within the framework of the World Summit on Information Society and note with satisfaction the public and private contributions made for its financing.
We resolve to take the necessary measures to combat corruption at both national and international levels and to ensure that illegally acquired and transferred funds and assets and their proceeds deposited in foreign banks are returned to the countries of origin.
We welcome the progress made by Venezuela to establish the International Humanitarian Trust Fund with the first deposit of US$30 million and call for support to this initiative to assist developing countries in their efforts to improve the welfare and standard of living of their people.
We welcome and applaud the initiative of the State of Qatar to establish and host “The South Fund for Development and Humanitarian Assistance” and the donation of US$20 million to assist the countries of the South in their developmental efforts in economic, social, health and educational development, and to address the problems of hunger, poverty and human catastrophes.
We also express appreciation to the Governments of China and India for their contribution of US$2 million each to the Fund.
In this context, we invite other countries in a position to do so to contribute to the Fund.
We note with concern the increased incidence of natural disasters and their destructive effects on the development of developing countries, in particular small and vulnerable economies, and we call for an increased international assistance in the creation and strengthening of national, subregional, regional and international mechanisms for prevention, preparedness and mitigation of natural disasters and their effects, including through early warning systems as well as long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction.
In this regard, we call on the UN system and the international community to work in close coordination to fulfill the commitments established to assist affected and disaster-prone countries, for their Governments and relevant authorities to receive the early-warning information in an unrestrictive and timely manner for their immediate and effective utilization and diffusion.
We further call upon the UN system and the international community to support the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 in disaster-prone developing countries, including through financial and technical assistance, addressing debt sustainability, technology transfer, and public-private partnerships, and encourage North-South and South-South cooperation.
We are concerned with emerging new diseases such as SARS, Avian Influenza and other virus-related diseases that appear in different parts of the world and can cause an epidemic within a short period of time, as well as adversely affect social and economic well-being of our peoples.
In this context, we recognize the need to coordinate our efforts at the national, regional and international levels to develop an effective response to the spread of those life-threatening diseases and underscore the importance of a comprehensive surveillance network including a veterinary network and mechanisms to promote rapid, transparent and accurate exchange of information and provide early warning.
We remain deeply concerned that HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis and other communicable diseases continue to threaten the achievement of the economic and social development of developing countries and call on international community to assist developing countries, in particular LDCs in expanding and strengthening programmes related to those diseases.
We call on developed countries and other countries in position to do so, to increase their contributions to the Global Fund to Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
We further call for the international cooperation, including South-South cooperation to assist in undertaking concrete measures to ensure prevention, treatment, care and support to those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS and access to drugs at affordable costs to those in need.
We recognize that gender equality and the full participation of women in all spheres are integral to building a just society for all and must be at the centre of all economic and social development.
We recommit ourselves to the urgent goal of achieving gender equality, to eliminating discrimination and violence against women and to ensuring their full participation in all areas of life and at all levels.
We stress the need to address in a holistic and comprehensive manner the sustainable development of indigenous and local communities as well as rural communities taking into account that in many developing countries they form part of some of the poorest communities.
We recognize that addressing the Special Needs of Africa requires direct support for the programmes drawn up by African leaders within the framework of NEPAD and in this regard, notes that while there has been significant international recognition of the need to support NEPAD initiatives, limited resources have been allocated by the international community to projects and programmes identified within the various sectors.
Such support is crucial for the promotion of regional integration and cooperation and for the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals including the MDG's, which are indispensable for Africa's sustained economic growth and sustainable development.
We call upon the multilateral and bilateral donors to achieve and implement their concrete commitments to support NEPAD programmes to enable Africa to address its economic and social challenges.
We welcome the establishment of the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership (NAASP) and its Plan of Action adopted at the Asian-African Conference held in Jakarta, Indonesia on 22-23 April 2005 as an important building block in further strengthening South-South cooperation.
We recognize the important role South based regional, sub regional and interregional mechanisms and arrangements are playing in promoting South-South cooperation including triangular cooperation and call upon the international community to continue its active support.
We are deeply concerned by the continued marginalization of the LDCs in the global economy and the continued deterioration of their economic and social conditions in spite of the commitments made by development partners at the Third UN Conference on LDCs in May 2001.
In this regard we urge the developed countries and relevant organizations of the U.N. system, including the Bretton Woods institutions to increase concerted efforts and adopt speedy measures for meeting, in timely manner, the goals and targets of the Brussels Programme of Action in favor of the LDCs for the decade 2001-2010.
We recognize and acknowledge the special needs of the landlocked developing countries within a New Global Framework for transit transport cooperation for landlocked and transit developing countries and reaffirm our continued support for their endeavours in every regard, particularly in their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action.
We remain concerned by the special problems and vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and, we express concern that, although great efforts have been undertaken by the SIDS at the national and regional level, there has not been commensurate support at the international level.
In this regard, we call for the strengthening of efforts at the international level in the implementation and follow-up of the Mauritius Strategy adopted at the United Nations International meeting, which undertook a full and comprehensive review on the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of the Small Island Development States.
We advocate the peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue and welcome the progress made in the resolution of conflicts in Africa.
In this context, we must address the root causes of conflict and underline the intrinsic link between sustainable peace and development and in this regard we call for the substantial support of the international community to ensure durable peace and the transition to sustainable development.
We emphasize the need to continue to pay special attention to the situation of developing countries emerging from conflict, in particular LDCs, with a view to enabling them to rehabilitate and reconstruct, as appropriate, their political, social and economic infrastructures and to assist them in achieving their development objectives.
We also express dismay at the increasing number of children involved in and affected by armed conflict, as well as all other form of violence including domestic violence, sexual abuse and exploitation, trafficking in persons and organs.
We support cooperation policies aimed at strengthening the national capacities to improve the situation of those children and to assist in their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
We strongly condemn all acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all their forms and manifestations as criminal and unjustifiable, wherever and by whomsoever committed them and in this regard, we call upon all States to adopt further measures in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant provisions of international law, including international human rights and humanitarian law, to prevent terrorism and to strengthen international cooperation in combating terrorism.
We note with deep concern the increase of all kinds of criminal activities, including illicit traffic of arms, drugs and other products which are used to foster and finance organized crimes and all types of transnational crimes, which continue to be a major factor of instability and a threat to development.
In this context, we are also deeply concerned by the trafficking of women and children, which is not only an offense against human dignity, but also a violation of International Law.
We call upon all countries to join the multilateral effort of the international community to develop mechanisms that will strengthen cooperation in terms of prevention and elimination of these activities, so that the stability and prosperity of all economies and societies can be guaranteed.
In this regard, we take note of the adoption of the Bangkok Declaration at the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on 25 April 2005 which aims to improve international cooperation in this matter.
We express concern with the lack of or insufficient transparency and accuracy of travel advisories against developing countries.
We call for greater consultation between States and the issuance of travel advisories in order to ensure accuracy, while minimizing the adverse effects of such advisories in national development efforts such as in attracting tourists and foreign investment.
We call upon the Government of the United States to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba which, in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the UN Charter and international law, and to the principle of neighborliness, causes huge material loses and economic damage to the people of Cuba.
We urge strict compliance with the resolutions 47/19, 48/16, 49/8, 50/10, 51/17, 52/10, 53/4, 54/21, 55/20, 56/9, 57/11, 58/7 and 59/11 of the United Nations General Assembly and express deep concern over the widening of the extra-territorial nature of the embargo against Cuba and over continuous new legislative measures geared to intensify it.
We therefore express concern and reject the new measures recently implemented by the US government aimed at tightening the embargo.
Those measures constitute a violation of Cuba's sovereignty and a massive violation of the rights of its people.
We express deep concern over the economic and social impact against the Syrian people of unilateral sanctions against Syria and call upon the United States to null and void the so-called “Syria Accountability Act”, and to resort to dialogue between the two countries based on respect and mutual interest for the best of the two nations and their peoples.
We also express our deep concern over the air attack against the El-Shifa Pharmaceuticals Factory in the Sudan on 20 August 1998, and its negative impact on that country's economic and social development.
We express our support and solidarity with the Sudan for its demand for a just and fair consideration of the matter by the United Nations on the basis of international law.
We call upon the international community to provide the necessary assistance to landmine clearance operations, as well as to the rehabilitation of the victims and their social and economic integration into the landmine affected countries.
In this connection we welcome the creation of the Forum of Mine Affected Countries, FOMAC, an instrument aimed at strengthening international cooperation towards achieving the objective of a world free from landmines.
We express concern over the residues of the Second World War, in particular in the form of landmines which cause human and material damage and obstruct development plans in some developing countries.
We demand that the States primarily responsible for laying the mines outside of their territories assume responsibility for the landmines, cooperate with the affected countries to get rid of them, and contribute to defraying the costs of clearance and provide compensation for any ensuing losses and for reclaiming the effected areas for productive purposes.
We affirm the need for a just solution to the question of Palestine in all its aspects in accordance with International law and relevant United Nations resolutions for the achievement of a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.
In this regard, we reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including the right to establish their independent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
We stress that Israel's unlawful practices in colonizing Palestinian land through, inter alia, the construction of the Wall, which is intricately linked with the illegal Israeli settlement campaign in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, constitute breaches of international law and are an impediment to the establishment of a viable Palestinian State.
In this regard, we recognize the importance of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice, rendered on 9 July 2004, and demand the full implementation of General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004.
We also call for the complete dismantlement and immediate end of all illegal Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan.
We also reaffirm our conviction that the Israeli occupation remains the main obstacle to the efforts to achieve a sustainable development and sound economic environment in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan.
Further, we affirm the necessity of achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425 (1978), the principle of land for peace, the terms of reference of the Madrid Peace Conference, the Roadmap, the Beirut Arab Peace Initiative and thus the withdrawal of Israel from all the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, the occupied Syrian Golan to the 4 June 1967 line, and the remaining occupied Lebanese territories.
We support the inalienable right of Lebanon to utilize its waters in accordance with the international law, in particular to ensure the social and economic needs of its population in the liberated areas and villages.
We call on Israel to end its air violations of Lebanese sovereignty and other violation that severely damage the security situation which is a critical factor in promoting the tourism industry and the economy.
We also call on Israel to release all the Lebanese prisoners and detainees in the Israeli prisons and we call on Israel to provide the United Nations with all the maps and information on the location of the landmines that it has planted in the south of Lebanon during its occupation which are hindering the development and rehabilitation of the south of Lebanon and preventing the agricultural exploitation of vast areas of rich agrarian land and we express support for the assistance in the demining efforts in the south of Lebanon.
