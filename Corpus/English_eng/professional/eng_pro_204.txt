Gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities
Report of the Secretary-General
Introduction
Scope and scale of statistical analysis
The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 57/281 B of 18 June 2003, in which the Secretary-General was requested to provide a report, on a biennial basis, on the use of gratis personnel, indicating their nationality and duration of service, department where employed and functions performed.
It updates the previous annual report (A/57/721), and covers the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2004.
This report is the first biennial report to be submitted to the Assembly since the adoption of resolution 57/281 B, which changed the frequency of reporting on the situation of gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities from an annual to a biennial basis.
However, information is presented by the calendar year for 2003 and 2004.
Also, the methodology for the compilation and statistical analysis of data for the report has been expanded in order to meet the requirements of General Assembly resolution 57/281 B.
Instead of presenting a snapshot of data as at the end of the reporting period, the current report presents data on a cumulative basis for an entire calendar year by type of gratis personnel.
The change in methodology contributed to the increase in the overall reported numbers of gratis personnel in 2003 and 2004, and to the better identification of functions performed by type I and type II gratis personnel.
Type I gratis personnel served under an established regime (see ST/AI/1999/6) and comprises three categories: interns, associate experts and technical cooperation experts obtained on a non-reimbursable loan basis.
Type II gratis personnel are personnel provided to the United Nations by a Government or other entity responsible for the remuneration of the services of such personnel and who do not serve under any other established regime (ibid.).
Information on each type of gratis personnel for each year is sorted by nationality and department, with aggregated data provided, where applicable, for the rest of the indicators requested by the General Assembly, such as functions performed and duration of service.
Accordingly, 10 tables are annexed to this report.
While the expanded methodology referred to above contributed to the increase in the number of type II gratis personnel reported for 2003 and 2004, the increase is primarily the result of the expansion of emergency and humanitarian relief operations coordinated by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
In an effort to align information in this report with others presented to the Assembly, such as the report of the Secretary-General on the composition of the Secretariat, the current report includes for the first time data and statistical analysis on gender for each year, type and category of gratis personnel.
Type I gratis personnel during 2003 and 2004
Tables I to VI provide data on type I gratis personnel in 2003 and 2004.
Tables I and II provide data by nationality for 2003 and 2004, respectively, for the three categories of type I gratis personnel (interns, associate experts and technical cooperation experts).
Similarly, tables III and IV provide data by department for 2003 and 2004, respectively, for the three categories.
Tables V and VI provide information on the functions performed by associate experts and technical cooperation experts in 2003 and 2004, respectively.
According to the breakdown by nationality, the overall number of type I gratis personnel in 2003 was 1,149, with 111 nationalities represented.
In 2004 the number increased to 1,290, with 114 nationalities represented.
The increase in the number of type I gratis personnel was attributable to the increase in the number of interns, which constituted the majority of this group of personnel.
The change in methodology referred to in paragraph 3 above has had a distinct impact on the reported number of interns.
There were 142 interns as at the end of 2002.
A cumulative count resulted in about a seven-fold increase to 1,057 interns in 2003, accounting for 92 per cent of type I gratis personnel.
The number increased further to 1,201 (93 per cent) in 2004.
The numbers of associate experts and technical cooperation experts registered a decline.
As at the end of 2002, there were 124 associate experts; there were 78 in 2003 and 77 in 2004.
The number of technical cooperation experts decreased from 35 as at the end of 2002, to 14 in 2003 and 12 in 2004.
The normal duration of an internship is two months (see ST/AI/2000/9, section 3.1), while associate experts and technical cooperation experts serve normally for an initial period of up to one year (see ST/AI/1999/6, section 6.1).
On gender distribution, women comprised 63 per cent of type I gratis personnel in 2003 and 61 per cent in 2004.
Type II gratis personnel during 2003 and 2004
Information on type II gratis personnel is provided in tables VII to X, and has been compiled using the same methodology as was used for type I gratis personnel.
Tables VII and VIII provide cumulative data sorted by nationality and with gender distribution for 2003 and 2004, respectively.
Tables IX and X present the same data, but organized by department, with information on category and functions performed, as well as duration of service.
Only two entities used type II gratis personnel during the two-year period covered in the report: the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) in 2003 and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in both 2003 and 2004.
According to the breakdown by nationality, a total of 53 type II gratis personnel were recorded in 2003, with 23 nationalities represented in different emergency and relief operations worldwide.
Of the 53 persons, three were engaged in more than one relief operation, bringing the total number of engagements to 56.
Thirty-four of the total served with relief operations of OCHA under the United Nations disaster assessment and coordination arrangements and 21 were under the standby arrangements, which were established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 46/182 (sect.
IV, paras.
27 and 28).
The remaining one engagement was that of a hydrology expert provided by the Government of Germany to ESCWA for a two-year period, ending on 31 December 2003.
The average duration of service of type II gratis personnel in 2003 was 2.6 months.
Examples of operations during 2003 were those following earthquakes in Algeria, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey and floods or landslides in Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka and the Sudan.
According to the breakdown by nationality, a total of 85 type II gratis personnel were recorded in 2004, with 33 nationalities represented; all served under the standby arrangements of OCHA or United Nations disaster assessment and coordination arrangements.
Owing to their availability or expertise, 22 persons served in more than one relief operation, bringing the total number of engagements to 107.
Of the total number of engagements, 78 were under the United Nations disaster assessment and coordination arrangements and 29 were under the standby arrangements.
The average duration of service of type II gratis personnel in 2004 was 1.8 months.
Examples of operations in 2004 were those following floods or typhoons in Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Micronesia and Vanuatu, and the tsunami catastrophe at the end of 2004.
On gender distribution, women comprised 19 per cent of type II gratis personnel in 2003 and 26 per cent in 2004.
Conclusion and recommendation
The methodology used for the compilation and statistical analysis of data for this report has been expanded in scope and scale in order to meet the requirements of General Assembly resolution 57/281 B.
The change from providing a snapshot of information as at the end of a reporting period to a methodology providing cumulative information over an entire calendar year has contributed to the increase in the recorded number of gratis personnel in 2003 and 2004.
The impact of that change in reporting is particularly noticeable in the case of type I gratis personnel, where the number increased from 301 as at the end of 2002 to 1,151 in the calendar year 2003 and to 1,291 in the calendar year 2004.
The number of type II gratis personnel increased from 1 as at the end of 2002 to 53 in 2003 and 85 in 2004.
The increase is due primarily to the volume and the number of emergency and relief operations worldwide.
More than 60 per cent of type I gratis personnel were women in both 2003 and 2004.
While the percentage was lower for type II gratis personnel, it grew from 19 per cent in 2003 to 26 per cent in 2004.
The Secretary-General recommends that the General Assembly take note of the report.
