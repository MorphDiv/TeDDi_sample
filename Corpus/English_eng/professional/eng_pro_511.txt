Financing of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti
Revised budget for the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Mandate and planned results
The mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1542 (2004) of 30 April 2004.
The most recent extension of the mandate was authorized by the Council in its resolution 1608 (2005) of 22 June 2005.
By the same resolution, the Council authorized a temporary increase, during the electoral period and subsequent political transition, of 750 personnel to MINUSTAH's authorized military strength and 275 personnel to the strength of MINUSTAH's civilian police component in order to provide increased security, as well as an increase of 50 military personnel to create a sector headquarters in Port-au-Prince.
The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to restore peace and security and to further the constitutional political process under way in Haiti.
Within this overall objective, the Mission will, during the budget period, contribute to a number of expected accomplishments, by delivering related key outputs presented in frameworks.
These frameworks, shown below, are grouped by component: a secure and stable environment; the political process; human rights; humanitarian and development coordination; and support.
These components, as well as the expected accomplishments within each of the components, have been reviewed by the General Assembly in the context of the initial budget of the Mission for 2005/2006 and remain unchanged.
The expected accomplishments would lead to the fulfilment of the Security Council's objective within the lifetime of the Mission and the indicators of achievement show a measurement of progress towards such accomplishments during the budget period.
Additional or revised indicators of achievement, as well as additional outputs to be produced with the proposed additional resources, have been included within each component of the frameworks where applicable.
The previously formulated indicators and achievements and outputs have been identified as “no change”.
The human resources of the Mission in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the Mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Mission as a whole.
Variances in the number of personnel, compared to the initial budget for 2005/2006, have been explained under the respective components.
The Mission is established in 10 districts, comprising the Mission headquarters in Port-au-Prince, four regional headquarters (Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haïtien, Gonaïves and Les Cayes) and six district offices (Jacmel, Port-de-Paix, Hinche, Miragoâne, Fort-Liberté and Jérémie).
The military, formed police and civilian police components of the mission are currently deployed in 23 areas of responsibility and will be deployed to 27 areas of responsibility, centred in Port-au-Prince (divided into four areas), Cap-Haïtien, Fort-Liberté, Port-de-Paix, Gonaïves, Saint-Marc, Hinche, Jacmel, Les Cayes, Jérémie, Killick, Brach, Léogâne, Cabaret, Petit-Goâve, Pignon, Terre-Rouge, Ouanaminthe, Mirebalais, Port-Salut, Croix des Bouquets, Thomazeau, Malpas and Forêt des Pins.

(a) Appropriation of the amount of $48,754,900 for the 12-month period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 in addition to the amount of $494,887,000 already appropriated by the General Assembly in its resolution 59/17 B;

Summary
In its resolution 59/17 B of 22 June 2005, the General Assembly appropriated to the Special Account for the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) the amount of $494,887,000 for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, inclusive of $470,073,600 for the maintenance of the mission, $20,289,800 for the support account for peacekeeping operations and $4,523,600 for the United Nations Logistics Base.
The resources approved by the Assembly for the maintenance of the mission were based on the ceilings of the military and civilian police components authorized by the Security Council in its resolution 1542 (2004) of 30 April 2004.
In its resolution 1608 (2005) of 22 June 2005, the Security Council extended the mandate of MINUSTAH until 15 February 2006, and authorized an increase of 50 military personnel as well as a temporary increase during the electoral period and subsequent political transition of 750 military personnel and 275 civilian police.
The present report contains the revised budget for MINUSTAH for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, which amounts to $518,828,500 and which represents an increase of $48,754,900 from the amount of $470,073,600 appropriated by the General Assembly in its resolution 59/17 B for the maintenance of the mission for the same period.
It should be read in conjunction with the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of MINUSTAH of 18 March 2005 (A/59/745) containing the Mission's initial budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006.
The revised budget provides for the deployment of an additional 800 military contingent personnel and 275 civilian police officers including one formed unit, for a total revised strength of 7,500 military contingent personnel and 1,897 civilian police.
It also provides for the temporary recruitment of 17 international staff, 30 national staff and 18 United Nations volunteers.
The revised resource requirements for MINUSTAH for the financial period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 have been linked to the mission's objectives through a number of results-based frameworks, grouped by the components set out in the initial 2005/2006 budget for the mission (A/59/745) and already reviewed by the General Assembly: a secure and stable environment, the political process, human rights, humanitarian and development coordination, and support.
Accordingly, the present report reflects in the framework components only additional or revised indicators of achievement and outputs.
The human resources of the mission in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the mission's executive direction and management which can be attributed to the mission as a whole.
The explanation of variances in resource levels, both human resources and financial resources, have, where applicable, been linked to specific additional outputs planned by the mission.

Reference
The present section of the report describes the single largest contributing factor of each resource variance according to specific standard options encompassed in the four standard categories listed below:
Mandate:variances caused by changes in the scale or scope of the mandate, or changes in the expected accomplishments as driven by the mandate; External:variances caused by parties or situations external to the United Nations; Cost parameters:variances caused by United Nations regulations, rules and policies; Management:variances caused by management actions to achieve planned results more effectively (e.g., by reprioritizing or adding certain outputs) or efficiently (e.g., by taking measures to reduce personnel or operational inputs while maintaining the same level of outputs) and/or from performance related issues (e.g., by having underestimated the costs or quantities of inputs required to produce a certain level of outputs, or by delayed recruitment).
