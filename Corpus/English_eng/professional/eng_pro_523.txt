[6 September 2005]
In response to the request of the Department of Disarmament Affairs for relevant information and views on resolution 59/80 entitled “Measures to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction”, Canada is pleased to inform the Secretary-General of the following:
• Canada has actively participated in the Proliferation Security Initiative aimed at eliminating the illicit traffic in materials for weapons of mass destruction.
• Canada made an important contribution to the successful diplomatic conference to amend the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material in July 2005 (Canada is currently undertaking the necessary ratification process).
• As a participant of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, Canada has actively pursued amendments to strengthen the Group's guidelines.
• Canada has actively participated in the Group of Eight Global Partnership to secure and destroy weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union and has committed $1 billion over 10 years to that initiative.
• Canada is the second-largest financial contributor to the Nuclear Security Action Plan of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
• Canada has adhered to the IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, and has agreed to implement the relative guidance on the export and import of sources by 31 December 2005.
• The Canadian Parliament passed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention Implementation Act which received royal assent on 6 May 2004.
The act, which will function to make it more difficult for terrorists to acquire and/or use biological weapons, is framework legislation that streamlines existing laws that deal peripherally with biological weapons issues and thus provides a more complete legal basis for the regulation of dual-use biological agents.
It also establishes stricter penalties for contraventions of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.
• In Canada, licences are required for the production, use, acquisition and stockpiling of schedule 1 chemicals.
For the transfer, production and use of schedule 2 chemicals, declarations are required.
Thanks to such strict licensing requirements, Canada prevents acquisition by terrorists of chemicals that could be used in weapons of mass destruction.
