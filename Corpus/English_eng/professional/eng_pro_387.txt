The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.
Agenda item 56 (continued)
Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations
(g) Cooperation between the United Nations and the Economic Community of Central African States
Draft resolution A/59/L.16/Rev.1
The President (spoke in French): Members will recall that the Assembly held its debate on agenda item 56 and its sub-items (a) through (t) at its 38th through 40th plenary meetings, on 21 and 22 October 2004.
In connection with sub-item (g), the Assembly has before it a draft resolution issued as document A/59/L.16/Rev.1.
Mr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): It is my honour to introduce draft resolution A/59/L.16/Rev.1, under sub-item (g) of agenda item 56, on behalf of the following 11 countries members of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS): Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda and Sao Tome and Principe.
As the President recalled, the General Assembly has already had an opportunity to consider the agenda item concerning cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations.
At that time action on the draft resolution was postponed in order to allow for greater coordination with certain interested partners and so that we could take account of geopolitical and security developments under way in the Central African subregion.
The text that I am introducing today is little different from that of resolutions adopted in previous years.
The emphasis today is on the need for sustained efforts on the part of the Secretary-General and the entire international community within the framework of assistance to subregional institutions.
Once again, we welcome the Secretary-General's initiative to dispatch, in June 2003, at the request of the Security Council, a multidisciplinary assessment mission to Central Africa to determine how best to ensure a comprehensive, resolute and coordinated approach to problems relating to peace, security and development in the subregion.
Emphasis is also placed on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the mission's report, at a time when Central Africa has more favourable prospects for peace and security.
The post-conflict situation in most of the countries of the region requires increased efforts, particularly within the framework of implementing disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes.
We therefore call upon the international community to provide substantive assistance so as to contribute to the consolidation of the various peace operations under way in Central Africa.
As in previous years, the States of ECCAS would like the General Assembly to adopt the draft resolution by consensus.
The President (spoke in French): We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution A/59/L.16/Rev.1, entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the Economic Community of Central African States”.
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/59/L.16/Rev.1?
Draft resolution A/59/L.16/Rev.1 was adopted (resolution 59/310).
The President (spoke in French): May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (g) of agenda item 56?
It was so decided.
The President (spoke in French): The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 56.
Agenda item 8 (continued)
Organization of work, adoption of the agenda and allocation of items: request for the reallocation of sub-item (b) of agenda item 85
The President (spoke in French): Members will recall that at its 2nd plenary meeting on 17 September 2004, the General Assembly decided to allocate sub-item (b) of agenda item 85 to the Second Committee under heading B, “Promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences”.
Members will also recall that sub-item (b) of agenda item 85 remained open for consideration during the fifty-ninth session.
In order for the General Assembly to proceed expeditiously with the consideration of the draft resolution issued as document A/59/L.63 under the sub-item, may I take it that the General Assembly wishes to consider sub-item (b) of agenda item 85 directly in plenary meeting under heading B, “Promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences”?
It was so decided.
The President (spoke in French): May I further take it that the Assembly agrees to proceed immediately to the consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 85?
As there is no objection, we shall proceed accordingly.
Agenda item 85 (continued)
Sustainable Development
(b) Further implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States
Note by the Secretary-General (A/59/872)
Draft resolution (A/59/L.63)
The President (spoke in French): In connection with this item, the General Assembly has before it a note by the Secretary-General circulated in document A/59/872, transmitting the report of the International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.
I give the floor to the representative of Jamaica to introduce draft resolution A/59/L.63.
Mr. Neil (Jamaica): On behalf of the States members of the Group of 77 and China, I have the honour this afternoon to introduce for the consideration of the General Assembly the draft resolution entitled “International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States”, which has been issued as document A/59/L.63.
The following countries have added their names to the list of sponsors: Austria, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Turkey and Tuvalu.
The draft resolution addresses the outcome of the International Meeting held in Mauritius from 10 to 14 January 2005, which had as its principal focus a review of the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.
The draft resolution, in paragraph 2, endorses the outcome of the International Meeting, as embodied in the Mauritius Declaration and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.
Their adoption was the culmination of months of extensive preparation and intensive negotiations among delegations at the International Meeting.
The draft resolution focuses special attention on implementation, calls for concrete measures to fulfil agreed commitments and urges all parties, Governments and international agencies towards effective action.
That is the principal theme of paragraphs 4, 5 and 6.
In paragraph 7, the draft recommends that the outcomes of the meeting be taken into consideration at the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly, to be held from 14 to 16 September 2005, and in its preparatory process.
Also of particular importance is the role of the Secretariat in advancing coordinated and coherent implementation.
Accordingly, paragraphs 8, 9, 10 and 11 call for particular measures to be taken by the Secretary-General and by agencies within the international system.
The sponsors take this opportunity to express their deep appreciation to the Government and the people of Mauritius for hosting the International Meeting and for making all the necessary arrangements for reaching a successful outcome.
The constructive proposals in the draft resolution merit the support of the international community.
The widespread consultations allowed for the views and interests of the United Nations membership to be accommodated in a consensus text.
On that basis, we invite the General Assembly to give favourable consideration to the draft resolution, and we express the hope that it will meet with the unanimous approval of the Assembly.
Mr. Koonjul (Mauritius): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).
We would like to add our voice to that of the Chairman of the Group of 77 and China.
We commend to the General Assembly draft resolution A/59/L.63, endorsing the outcomes of the Mauritius International Meeting, namely, the Mauritius Declaration and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, adopted at the International Meeting.
I would also like to thank all the countries that sponsored the draft resolution.
The Mauritius International Meeting, held from 10 to 14 January 2005 — the first major United Nations international conference that took place after the catastrophic tsunami of 26 December 2004 — saw the participation of almost 2,000 delegates, including 18 Presidents, Vice-Presidents and Prime Ministers, some 60 other ministers, and representatives of United Nations agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.
Your own presence, Mr. President, and that of the Secretary-General at the International Meeting — which were very highly appreciated and which enhanced the profile of the Meeting — attested to the prime importance you both attach to the cause of small island developing States.
The Mauritius International Meeting was the culmination of more than a decade of efforts by small island developing States and by our partners in the international community to elaborate a framework for the sustainable development of small island developing States.
The 10-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action provided us with an opportunity to look back at our efforts towards the sustainable development of our countries with the support of our development partners.
For AOSIS, the preparatory process started more than two years ago and culminated in the January 2004 inter-regional ministerial meeting of small island developing States, held in the Bahamas, from which the small island developing States' draft strategy for the further implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action emanated.
The review highlighted the causes of poor implementation: a dearth of resources, poor human and institutional capacity, a lack of technology transfer and, in some cases, the absence of a holistic and integrated approach to sustainable development.
In addition, new and emerging issues such as HIV/AIDS, globalization and the erosion of trade preferences traditionally enjoyed by small island developing States, as well as the new emphasis on security, have further slowed implementation efforts.
Good progress in the negotiations on the draft strategy document was made here in New York at United Nations Headquarters and in the course of the three informal rounds of consultations, as well as during the two days of pre-meeting sessions in Mauritius.
We wish to express our deepest appreciation to our partners for their flexibility and understanding during the negotiating process.
I would also like to thank all the Friends of the Host of the International Meeting and other friendly countries for their important contributions to the success of the Mauritius Meeting.
We would like to place on record our special thanks and gratitude to the former Permanent Representative of New Zealand, His Excellency Ambassador Don MacKay, for his outstanding role as the facilitator of the negotiating process.
His leadership, vision and excellent diplomatic skills proved to be critical in reaching the very successful final outcome.
Our thanks go also to the Secretary-General of the International Meeting, His Excellency Mr. Anwarul Chowdhury, Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, and to all the staff of the United Nations Secretariat, in particular those in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and its Small Island Developing States Unit.
I would also like to thank most sincerely all the countries that contributed to the Small Island Developing States Trust Fund.
A word of thanks goes also to Mr. Mark Ramsden, Counsellor in the Permanent Mission of New Zealand, who kindly facilitated the reaching of consensus on the present resolution.
Allow me to highlight some essential aspects of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation.
The Strategy provides the blueprint for action-oriented, concrete and practical measures to address the concerns of small island developing States as identified in the Barbados Programme of Action, as well as new and emerging issues.
The Mauritius International Meeting brought the Barbados Programme closer to gaining a broader perspective on the sustainable development of small island developing States and to current funding priorities, and forged links with the review of the Millennium Declaration.
The Mauritius Strategy also combines the relevant aspects of the Millennium Development Goals with the sustainable development priorities of small island developing States.
It is in that context that, in the informal consultations convened by the President of the General Assembly in relation to the September 2005 High-level Plenary Meeting, we have repeatedly stressed the outcomes of the Mauritius International Meeting and the fact that they need to be taken into consideration in the September 2005 outcome document.
We have also pointed out that the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation constitutes an important input in the area of sustainable development.
The Mauritius Strategy also notes that small island developing States have implemented the Barbados Programme of Action principally through utilization of their own resources and that their efforts have been pursued within financial constraints, including an overall decline of official development assistance to small island developing States.
The Strategy covers all the sectoral chapters of the Barbados Programme of Action and also addresses new and emerging issues.
It clearly identifies areas in which small island developing States will require the support of the international community.
The Mauritius Strategy calls, inter alia, for a substantial increase in the flow of financial and other relevant resources, both public and private, and ensuring their effective use; improved trade opportunities; access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional or preferential basis, as mutually agreed; support in the area of education and awareness-raising; capacity-building; and support for national country-driven and country-owned strategies for sustainable development, including poverty reduction and resilience-building.
We appeal to our partners and to all donor institutions to assist small island developing States in enhancing their ability to implement the Mauritius Strategy.
The Alliance of Small Island States also welcomes the decision of the Commission on Sustainable Development, at its thirteenth session, to devote one day of the review sessions of the Commission to the review of the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy as well as any new developments on sustainable development efforts in small island States.
This is indeed a step in the right direction.
As the Secretary-General pointed out in his March 2005 report, the adverse effects of climate change, sea-level rise and associated phenomena such as the increase in intensity and frequency of extreme weather events threatens the sustainable development, the livelihoods of the people and the very existence of some States.
As we speak, a severe hurricane is once again pounding Grenada, causing severe damage.
As the Assembly will recall, the AOSIS summit held in the margins of the Mauritius International Meeting has called for the establishment and development of an all-hazard early-warning system as a priority in all the regions of the world and has also called for international support in that regard.
We welcome progress in that area, but it is equally important that our vulnerable group of countries receive urgent assistance to build resilience to such adversities.
The Mauritius Strategy will necessitate a clear road map for quick and practical actions to address the unique challenge facing the sustainable development of small island developing States and to address their economic, social and environmental vulnerabilities.
We believe also that the Small Island Developing States Unit within the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and the Small Island Developing States Network (SIDSnet) should be sustainably staffed and appropriately reinforced so that it can effectively service this important group of countries.
We have high expectations of the plan to be devised by the Secretary-General for DESA, and we look forward to clear recommendations for actions, to be taken in a coherent and coordinated manner, involving all the relevant United Nations bodies, the specialized agencies, regional commissions and other stakeholders.
In that regard, the Alliance of Small Island States appreciates the initiative taken by some United Nations agencies to mainstream the small island developing States and the Mauritius Strategy in their work programmes and to establish focal points for small island developing States within their respective secretariats.
The AOSIS member States will work closely at the national and regional levels with DESA for the convening of the regional meetings in 2005 and 2006.
Once again, we appeal to the donor community to contribute to the voluntary Trust Fund for Small Island Developing States to enable the effective participation of the small island developing States in those regional meetings.
Mauritius was indeed honoured to have had the opportunity to host the International Meeting on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, and we look forward to the adoption today of the draft resolution endorsing the Mauritius outcome by consensus.
Ms. Banks (New Zealand): New Zealand looks forward to the adoption of this draft resolution, which we trust will add impetus to the fulfilment of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation within the United Nations system.
New Zealand remains committed to the Mauritius Strategy.
We are pleased to see that its importance has been recognized, Mr. President, in your draft outcome for the September summit.
We want to see the summit outcome focus on all groups of vulnerable countries and those unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goals, including small island developing States.
New Zealand has consistently supported the strengthening of the Small Island Developing States Unit within the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
As a donor that has contributed extra-budgetary resources to fund its activities, we consider it important that the Secretary-General allocate sufficient resources to enable the Unit to carry out its mandated functions.
We would like to see the Unit's permanent staffing numbers raised to facilitate this.
As the draft resolution notes, this should be done within existing resources; from New Zealand's point of view, there is scope to reduce duplication in the system.
That could help us to free up resources that might then be reallocated to the Small Island Developing States Unit.
Ms. Walpole (United Kingdom): I will preface my statement with a short clarification.
I am speaking now as a representative of the United Kingdom, not of the European Union.
I now have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.
The acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, the candidate countries Turkey and Croatia, the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries Iceland and Norway members of the European Economic Area, as well as Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, align themselves with this statement.
The European Union would like to take this opportunity warmly to welcome the formal endorsement by the General Assembly of the Mauritius Declaration and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.
The European Union believes that these documents provide an important and substantial blueprint for future international support for, and collaboration with, the small island developing States.
We look forward to a continuing close coordination with the small island developing States in follow-up to the decisions taken in Mauritius.
Those of us who have been involved in the past months in the small island developing States process are keenly aware that many of the issues addressed in the Mauritius Strategy are those same important issues which the United Nations membership is now considering in the context of the upcoming Millennium review summit.
We remain committed to ensuring that the concerns of small island developing States are appropriately addressed at the forthcoming summit.
The European Union would also like to take this opportunity to express its warmest appreciation of, and thanks for, the central role played by the Government of Mauritius in piloting us through extensive preparations for the Mauritius International Meeting and for having so splendidly hosted that Meeting last January.
Mrs. Núñez de Odremán (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is prepared to endorse draft resolution A/59/L.63, which is before us for adoption, with a deep sense of solidarity with small island developing States.
Our delegation wishes to state that it dissociates itself from the content of operative paragraph 2 of the draft because of certain elements included in the Mauritius Strategy of Implementation.
Let me explain.
Venezuela is not a State party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and its provisions are not applicable to it under customary international law, apart from those expressly recognized by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and those it might in future recognize under its domestic laws.
In view of that, my delegation has dissociated itself from the content of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 27 of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation.
We reaffirm that position in connection with the adoption of draft resolution A/59/L.63.
The President (spoke in French): We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution A/59/L.63.
I call on the representative of the Secretariat.
Mr. Botnaru: In connection with draft resolution A/59/L.63, I should like to inform representatives that in response to paragraph 8 of the draft resolution it expected that consideration by the General Assembly at its sixtieth session of a report to be prepared, articulating a plan for the coordinated and coherent implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation by the relevant United Nations bodies, would serve as an occasion to discuss and define programmatic implications of the implementation of the Programme of Action, and in that regard to clarify the scale of resources required to support it.
On that understanding, paragraph 8 will have no programme budget implications for the current budget.
The Department of Economic and Social Affairs anticipates that, in response to paragraph 9 of the draft resolution, three regional meetings will be held, only in 2005, one each in the Caribbean region; the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and the South China Sea region; and the Pacific region.
It is estimated that $125,200 will be required for the holding of the three regional meetings of small island developing States in 2005.
The Secretariat will assess all existing extrabudgetary resources contributed to finance activities in support of the programme of work on small island developing States and will seek additional contributions if need be.
With a view to facilitating the full and effective implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, as called for in paragraph 10 of the draft resolution, the Secretariat will meet additional requirements within existing resources, including by internal redeployment of resources.
In summary, draft resolution A/59/L.63, if adopted, would have no programme budget implications for the 2004-2005 regular budget.
The President (spoke in French): The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A/59/L.63, entitled “International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States”.
Before we take action on draft resolution A/59/L.63, I wish to announce that the following countries have become sponsors of the draft resolution since its submission: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Turkey, Tuvalu and the United Kingdom.
May I take it that the General Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/59/L.63?
Draft resolution A/59/L.63 was adopted (resolution 59/311).
The President (spoke in French): May I take it that the General Assembly wishes to conclude its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 85 and of agenda item 85 as a whole?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 105 (continued)
Human rights questions
(b) Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms
Draft resolution (A/59/L.65)
The President (spoke in French): Members will recall that the Assembly dedicated its 70th plenary meeting, held on 10 December 2004, to a review of the achievements of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, 1995-2004, under this sub-item.
I give the floor to the representative of Australia to introduce draft resolution A/59/L.65.
Mr. Choi (Australia): The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, in article 26, that education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The Vienna World Conference on Human Rights also made it clear that human rights education is vital for the promotion and achievement of stable and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding, tolerance and peace.
Over the past decade, the General Assembly has adopted resolutions that have expressed a consensus view that human rights education makes a fundamental contribution to the full realization of human rights and to the long-term prevention of human rights abuses.
On 10 December 2004, the General Assembly proclaimed the World Programme for Human Rights Education in recognition of the need for a continuing international framework for human rights education.
The Programme, which incorporates targeted and time-limited phases, will lend itself to a more structured approach to international coordination of human rights education, including more responsive management and coordination.
It will facilitate the work of those already engaged in human rights education and will encourage others to develop appropriate programmes.
Unfortunately, we were unable to adopt the corresponding draft plan of action for human rights education on 10 December last year.
But now that States have had ample opportunity to comment on and review the draft plan, and given that the first stage of the World Programme, focusing on primary and secondary school systems, has already been proclaimed, it is now time to act.
Against that background, it is my pleasure to introduce the draft resolution entitled “World Programme for Human Rights Education”, contained in document A/59/L.65.
The text follows up on the General Assembly's resolution on human rights education, resolution 59/113 A of 10 December 2004, and the corresponding resolution of the Commission on Human Rights; by this draft resolution, the Assembly would adopt the revised draft plan of action for the first phase of the World Programme for Human Rights Education.
General Assembly resolutions on human rights education have traditionally had strong support from the international community, reflecting the importance that is attached to having an appropriate international framework for human rights education.
It is our firm hope and expectation that this draft resolution will be adopted with broad support from the General Assembly.
Before I conclude, I would like to announce the following additional sponsors: Andorra, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Haiti, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mali, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Uruguay.
The President (spoke in French): We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution A/59/L.65.
I give the floor to the representative of India, who wishes to speak in explanation of position before action is taking on the draft resolution.
May I remind delegations that explanations of vote or position are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Mrs. Tomar (India): I am taking the floor to speak in explanation of position before action is taken on the draft resolution on the World Programme for Human Rights Education, contained in document A/59/L.65.
My delegation wishes to thank the delegation of the main sponsor, Australia, for its efforts in submitting the draft resolution.
The draft resolution will ensure that the work started in the first Decade on Human Rights Education will gather further momentum in the coming decade.
The 10 December 2004 debate in the General Assembly on human rights education clearly brought out the importance that Member States are increasingly attaching to this aspect of the promotion of human rights.
In India, the idea of human rights is embodied in the Constitution, which was adopted in 1950, soon after India's independence.
The Constitution promotes and protects the human rights of the people of India.
Thus far, human rights education has been integrated into diverse subjects at different stages of education through India's education policy.
A National Action Plan for Human Rights Education was drawn up in cooperation with the National Human Rights Commission and is being implemented.
India is fully committed to promoting human rights education, and has taken several measures towards that end.
Under paragraph 1 of A/59/L.65, the General Assembly would adopt the revised draft plan of action for the first phase (2005-2007) of the World Programme for Human Rights Education, as contained in the annex to the Secretary-General's note (A/59/525/Rev.1).
The draft plan provides for the setting up of a United Nations inter-agency coordination committee composed of representatives from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme and other relevant international agencies, including the World Bank.
In our view, a prior intergovernmental agreement on details of the role, functioning and mandate of that committee is required, and we would have preferred to discuss this aspect further during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.
Since that has not proved possible, we wish to make clear that we do not envisage or accept any monitoring or evaluating mandate of a United Nations inter-agency coordination committee, particularly with reference to paragraphs 49 and 51 of the draft plan of action.
We are also concerned that neither the draft resolution nor the draft plan of action provides for any additional funding for implementation, particularly in developing countries.
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action noted that resource constraints and institutional inadequacies might impede the immediate realization of the objectives set out.
Strengthened international cooperation for poverty eradication remains a key ingredient for the promotion and protection of human rights, and for the promotion of human rights education.
The President (spoke in French): We have heard the only speaker in explanation of position before action is taken on the draft resolution before us.
The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A/59/L.65, entitled “World Programme For Human Rights Education”.
Since the publication of draft resolution, Kazakhstan has joined the list of sponsors.
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/59/L.65?
Draft resolution A/59/L.65 was adopted (resolution 59/312).
The President (spoke in French): I now give the floor to the representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, who wishes to speak in explanation of position on the draft resolution just adopted.
May I remind delegations that explanations of vote or position are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Mrs. Núñez de Odremán (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela supported draft resolution A/59/L.65.
We would like to state for the record, however, that we are already in the process of implementing national plans in the area of human rights education.
The World Programme for Human Rights Education, as adopted through the present resolution, is thus fully compatible and in harmony with our national programmes.
Likewise, with regard to paragraph 5 of the resolution, the plans of action undertaken by non-governmental organizations in our country are, and should be, subject to the requirements and priorities set out in our country's national plans.
The President (spoke in French): We have heard the only speaker in explanation of vote on the resolution just adopted.
May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 105 and of agenda item 105 as a whole?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 8 (continued)
Organization of work, adoption of the agenda and allocation items: request for the reallocation of agenda item 113
The President (spoke in French): Members will recall that at its 2nd plenary meeting, on 17 September 2004, the General Assembly decided to allocate agenda item 113 to the Fifth Committee under heading I, “Organizational, administrative and other matters”.
Members will also recall that agenda item 113 remained open for consideration during the fifty-ninth session.
I would like to draw members' attention to a letter dated 20 June 2005 from the Chairman of the Committee on Contributions addressed to the President of the General Assembly, circulated as document A/59/864.
In this letter, I have been requested by the Chairman of the Committee on Contributions to transmit to the General Assembly without delay the section of its report on its sixty-fifth session dealing with requests for exception under Article 19 from a number of Member States.
Additionally, I have received a letter dated 29 June 2005 from Sao Tome and Principe (A/59/869), a letter dated 8 July 2005 from Niger (A/59/868) and a letter dated 13 July 2005 from Liberia (A/59/871), requesting the General Assembly to act expeditiously to grant those three countries the exemption under Article 19 and to have this important matter taken up by the General Assembly in plenary meeting at the beginning of July.
The Assembly also has before it a draft resolution issued as document A/59/L.66.
As it is my understanding that agenda item 113 will not be taken up by the Fifth Committee in July, and in order for the General Assembly to proceed expeditiously with the consideration of this matter and of draft resolution A/59/L.66, may I take it that the General Assembly wishes to consider agenda item 113 directly in plenary meeting under heading I, “Organizational, administrative and other matters”?
It was so decided.
The President (spoke in French): May I further take it that the Assembly agrees to proceed immediately to the consideration of agenda item 113?
As I see no objection, we shall proceed accordingly.
The General Assembly will now resume its consideration of agenda item 113.
Agenda item 113 (continued)
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations
Letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Contributions addressed to the President of the General Assembly (A/59/864)
Draft resolution (A/59/L.66)
The President (spoke in French): I give the floor to the representative of Georgia to introduce draft resolution A/59/L.66.
Mr. Chitaia (Georgia): I have the honour of introducing draft resolution A/59/L.66 on behalf of the following sponsors: the Central African Republic, the Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, the Niger, Sao Tome and Principe, Somalia and Tajikistan.
At the outset, I wish to express my sincere thanks to you, President Ping, for exercising leadership in taking up this important matter of requests for exemption under Article 19 of the United Nations Charter in plenary meeting of the General Assembly.
The Government of Georgia, like other sponsors of this draft resolution, remains committed to meeting its financial obligations under the Charter, despite the difficult challenges facing it.
That commitment certainly includes the implementation of multiyear payment plans.
Thanks to your leadership, there is mounting momentum for United Nations reform, as evidenced by the lively discussions taking place in this very Hall.
I am convinced that the decisions we make prior to and during the summit in September will be of historic importance.
It would be contrary to the interests of the Organization if Member States willing to participate in and contribute to deliberations on United Nations reform were excluded from the decision-making process.
This is precisely the reason for which the sponsors have decided to submit the present draft resolution, and we earnestly appeal to all Member States to ensure its smooth adoption.
Draft resolution A/59/L.66 takes as its model last year's resolution on the same theme — resolution 59/1.
In our humble opinion, all the necessary elements are mentioned in the draft, including the reference to resolution 54/237 C, which sets out basic rules relating to the implementation of Article 19 of the Charter.
Furthermore, the present draft resolution is an arrangement of a tentative nature.
The delegations that sponsored the draft resolution, bearing in mind the concerns that various delegations might have, have done their best to accommodate such concerns.
We have no intention of prejudicing consideration by the Fifth Committee in the autumn.
It is from that perspective that operative paragraphs 4 and 7 stipulate that the General Assembly would permit us to vote “until the Assembly takes a final decision during the main part of the sixtieth session”.
My delegation welcomes the information that Liberia has submitted a letter to the President of the General Assembly requesting an exemption under Article 19 of the Charter, and it is my pleasure to announce that Liberia has also joined the list of sponsors of the draft resolution.
I should therefore like to request all member States to support my delegation's proposal to include Liberia in operative paragraphs 5, 6 and 7, along with the Niger and Sao Tome and Principe.
Allow me to reiterate our appeal for the smooth adoption of the draft resolution.
We sincerely hope that we will be able to take part in the historic decisions regarding United Nations reform, and we believe also that expeditious action by the General Assembly in that regard will serve the collective interests of the Organization.
The President (spoke in French): We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution A/59/L.66, as orally revised.
I shall now call on those representatives who wish to speak in explanation of position before action is taken on the draft resolution.
May I remind delegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Mr. Al-Humaimidi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me this opportunity to speak before the General Assembly.
My delegation requested the floor in order to make a statement under item 113 on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations, prior to the adoption of draft resolution A/59/L.66, in order to extend our sincere thanks to the Committee on Contributions for all the efforts it has deployed and is still deploying in carrying out its mandated tasks, in particular in considering the request for exemption under Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations.
In that regard, my delegation would like to note that it has previously presented to the President of the General Assembly a request to exempt Iraq from paying its financial obligations due to the circumstances and conditions currently prevailing in Iraq, as clearly explained before the Committee on Contributions, which is considering the issue, as indicated in document A/59/864, paragraphs 104, 105, 106 and 107 of the annex.
My delegation would like to express its gratitude to the Committee on Contributions for its understanding of the situation of Iraq and for recommending that Iraq be allowed to exercise its right to vote until 30 June 2006.
At the same time, the delegation of Iraq has been making strenuous efforts, working together with the Secretariat and the Security Council, to be permitted to pay its financial obligations from its assets in the security account that was established pursuant to the relevant Security Council resolutions with regard to the former regime in Iraq.
Thanks to the understanding of the Secretary-General and the Security Council, our efforts have been crowned with success and Iraq has made payment of all its financial obligations to the regular budget of the United Nations and to the peacekeeping budget, as well as with regard to the activities of the special Tribunals and to the United Nations capital master plan.
My delegation would like also to take note of the Secretary-General's letter dated 29 June 2005 addressed to the President of the General Assembly, which is contained in document A/59/668/Add.16.
Clearly, the President of the General Assembly and the Committee on Contributions were kept duly informed of all those developments, and Iraq was not included in the text of draft resolution A/59/L.66, which is now before the Assembly for consideration.
However, my delegation wished to brief the General Assembly on this matter.
The President (spoke in French): We have heard the only speaker in explanation of position.
The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution A/59/L.66, entitled “Requests for exemption under Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations”, as orally revised.
May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/59/L.66, as orally revised?
Draft resolution A/59/L.66, as orally revised, was adopted (resolution 59/313).
The President (spoke in French): The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 113.
