We also request that this agenda item be considered directly in plenary meeting.
Pursuant to rule 20 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, please find attached an explanatory memorandum (annex I) and a draft resolution (annex II).

Annex I to the letter dated 12 August 2005 from the Permanent Representatives of Australia, Canada, Israel, the Russian Federation and the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
Explanatory memorandum
In 2005, as we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations, we also mark the sixtieth year since the end of the Second World War and the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps.
The connection between those two events is testimony to the fact that the establishment of the United Nations, its founding principles and its noble mission were a response to the horrors of the Second World War and the tragedy of the Holocaust, as is reflected in the very first clauses of the Charter of the United Nations.
The Holocaust constituted a systematic and barbarous attempt to annihilate an entire people, in a manner and magnitude that have no parallel in human history.
Six million Jews, a full third of the Jewish people, together with countless other minorities, were murdered.
And yet, while the Holocaust was a unique tragedy for the Jewish people, its lessons are universal.
The United Nations, an organization founded on the ashes of the Holocaust and committed to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” and to uphold and protect the “dignity and worth of the human person”, bears a special responsibility to ensure that the Holocaust and its lessons are never forgotten and that this tragedy will forever serve as a warning to all people of the dangers of hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice.
In January 2005, Member States of the United Nations convened a historic special session of the General Assembly to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps.
At that session, Member States committed themselves to the principle of “Never again!” and affirmed the important role and responsibility of the United Nations in Holocaust remembrance and education to honour the victims and survivors of the Holocaust and to stand watch against the re-emergence of such evil for the benefit of future generations.
The fulfilment of that responsibility becomes ever more urgent as the generation of Holocaust survivors dwindle and in the face of an alarming increase in global acts of anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, racism and religious intolerance.
The consideration of the proposed item and the adoption of the proposed draft resolution (see annex II) would formalize and institutionalize Holocaust remembrance and education within the United Nations system.
It is particularly fitting that the item be included in the agenda of the upcoming landmark session of the General Assembly, which will mark the sixtieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations.
The proposed draft resolution comprises 10 preambular paragraphs and six operative paragraphs.
In its operative part, the resolution calls on the United Nations, inter alia, to establish 27 January as an annual International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust.
It urges Member States to develop educational programmes to inculcate future generations with the lessons of the Holocaust in order to help prevent future acts of genocide.
It further rejects any denial of the Holocaust, and condemns without reservation all manifestations of religious intolerance, incitement, harassment or violence against persons or communities based on ethnic origin or religious belief, wherever they occur.
In its final operative paragraph the draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to establish a programme of outreach entitled “The Holocaust and the United Nations”, as well as measures to mobilize civil society for Holocaust remembrance and education.
The sponsors of the present request call on all Member States to support the inclusion of the proposed supplementary item in the agenda of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly and to co-sponsor the proposed draft resolution.
In so doing, Member States will demonstrate their commitment to the cause of Holocaust remembrance and education, act to help prevent future acts of genocide and advance the fulfilment by the United Nations of its core mission and founding principles.
