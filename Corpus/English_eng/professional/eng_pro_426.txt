Sixtieth session
Item 114 (d) of the preliminary list*
Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments
* A/60/50 and Corr.1.
Appointment of a member of the Board of Auditors
Note by the Secretary-General
By its resolution 55/248 of 12 April 2001, the General Assembly amended its resolution 74 (I) of 7 December 1946.
Paragraphs 1 and 2 of General Assembly resolution 55/248 state:
“1.
Decides that the term of office of the Board of Auditors shall be a non-consecutive term of office of six years' duration starting on 1 July 2002;
“2.
Decides also, for the transitional arrangements, to approve alternative 1 in the report of the Secretary-General,1 whereby only the appointment of the Auditor-General of South Africa will be extended until 30 June 2006 and members elected under the current procedure shall be eligible for re-election.”
Accordingly, the present membership of the Board of Auditors is the following:
The First President of the Court of Accounts of France***
The Chairman of the Commission of Audit of the Philippines**
The Auditor-General of the Republic of South Africa*
* Term of office expires on 30 June 2006.
** Term of office expires on 30 June 2008.
*** Term of office expires on 30 June 2010.
Since the term of office of the Auditor-General of the Republic of South Africa will expire on 30 June 2006, it will be necessary for the General Assembly, at its sixtieth session, to fill the resulting vacancy by the appointment, as a member of the Board, of the Auditor-General, or officer holding the equivalent title, of a Member State.
The Auditor thus appointed will serve for a period of six years, beginning on 1 July 2006.
The three members of the Board have joint responsibility for the external audit of the United Nations, United Nations peacekeeping activities and special missions, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, the voluntary funds administered by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Fund of the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, the United Nations Office for Project Services, the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, the Capital Master Plan, the International Trade Centre, the United Nations University and the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund.
The Members of the Board also have joint responsibility for the audit of the United Nations Escrow (Iraq) Account, the United Nations Compensation Commission and for other activities upon request.
At the present time, audit assignments are shared among the audit staff provided from the audit services of the members of the Board on an equal basis.
In order to fulfil those shared responsibilities, each member provides approximately 350 auditor weeks each year, in addition to the full-time Director.
To enable the Board to carry out its mandate through the integration of audit planning, execution and reporting and to enhance the development of common audit standards and professional practices, an Audit Operations Committee was established comprising three full-time Directors of External Audit, located at Headquarters, representing each member of the Board.
The members of the Board are expected to be available for approximately two weeks each year, in June and November, for meetings of the Board and the Panel of External Auditors of the United Nations, the specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In addition, each member has to be available for whatever consultations are necessary throughout the year with the members of the Administration, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and other governing bodies.
At previous sessions, the Fifth Committee submitted to the General Assembly a draft decision containing the name of a Member State whose Auditor-General, or officer holding the equivalent title, was recommended for appointment.
It is suggested that a similar procedure be followed at the sixtieth session.
