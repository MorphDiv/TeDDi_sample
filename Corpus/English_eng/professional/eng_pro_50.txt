CThe contribution of the African Ministers' Council on Water to the thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development
Note by the secretariat
As at the was the case with the twelfth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, the African Ministers' Council on Water made a significant contribution to the th thirteenth session of the CSD Commission on Sustainable Development, which took place in New York in April 2005.
The contribution addressed, inter aliaamong other things, the efforts and initiatives spearheaded by the AUAfrican Union, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) NEPAD and the African Ministers' Council on WaterAMCOW, in close collaboration with partners, as they relate to the following:
Institutional frameworks for addressing the water policy challenges in Africa; Setting water policy priorities in Africa; Arrangements for implementation and partnerships; Creationng of an an the African Ministers' Council on Water AMCOW roadmap for the way forward in achieving the water-related MDGsMillennium Development Goals; and “Beyond CSD-”:CSD-the thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development:: accelerating the progress of implementation and monitoring progress [I distinctly remember that we decided to leave this “beyond csd-13”here as it is a slogan - this should be checked against the original version of this contribution…
In presenting its roadmap on the way forward in Africa, the AMCOW the African Ministers' Council on Water AMCOW proposesnotes that there is a need for a new strategic approach is needed if we are to be realistic in ourto ensure that realistic efforts are made to to for achieveing the water and sanitation targets are realistic The African Ministers' Council on Water AMCOW reiterateds, in its contribution to the the thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable DevelopmentCSD-, that at the Pan--African Implementation and Partnership Conference on Water, held in Addis Ababa in December 20003, the ministers responsible for water in the region should consider practical ways and strategic approaches to be followed in achieving the water-related MDGsMillennium Development Goals
In addition, the AMCOW African Ministers' Council on Water AMCOW also, in its contribution, recognized the need to establish, beyond the th thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the high-level plenary meeting of the United Nations UN General Assembly, to be held in (September 2005, to review progress in the fulfilment of the commitments contained in the Millennium Declaration), an effective mechanism for the monitoring and review of implementation of the Millennium Development GoalsMDGs At the current meeting, the The AMCOW Executive Committee of the African Ministers' Council on Water, at its meeting in Addis Ababa, 29-30 June will be invited to consider the possibility of establishing a formal mechanism for such a review.
The AMCOW Technical Advisory Committee of the African Ministers' Council on Water TAC will submit, for this purpose, elements for the terms of reference for the composition and work plan of such a commission, composition and work plan

The report on the AMCOW activities of the African Ministers' Council on Water at the thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, CSD-13 as well as a briefing note on the session itself, will be circulated separately.
Suggested action
The Executive Committee might wish to cConsideration of the recommendations on the establishment of an AMCOW regional mechanism of the African Ministers' Council on Water for monitoring progress in the implementation of the water--related outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, including the Millennium Development GoalsMDGs, and the recommendations of the CSD policy cycle on water of the Commission on Sustainable Development
Annex
Contribution of the African Ministers' Council on Water to the thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development and to the summit meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration
No water, no development, no future
We, the ministers responsible for water in Africa, are convinced that the equitable and sustainable management of water is and must remain the top development challenge for the foreseeable future for our continent.
For Africa, it is imperative that we achieve by 2015-2025 the Millennium Development Goals on water and sanitation and the other crucial and water-dependent goals on reducing poverty, hunger, child mortality, maternal mortality, and major diseases.
We take serious note of the assessment of the prevailing water situation contained in the 2003 United Nations World Water Development Report, entitled “Water for People, Water for Life”, which states that globally “some 25,000 people are still dying every day from malnutrition, while 6,000 people, mostly children under the age of five, are dying from water-related diseases”.
It continues to be a cause of particular concern to us that of those millions who have died since then and the thousands who will die today are mostly from Africa.
Many of the deaths could have been prevented through more equitable, effective and sustainable water management policies and practices.
We draw the attention of the Commission on Sustainable Development at its thirteenth session and of United Nations General Assembly at its high-level plenary meeting for a comprehensive review of the progress made in the fulfilment of the commitments contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to the continuing water-related challenges in Africa.
These revolve around four key areas, namely: water and health; water and poverty reduction; water and economic development; and water and environmental sustainability.
For our part, we are taking the necessary steps to reverse and halt the situation in conformity with the objectives of the African Union and the strategic direction provided by the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).
We shall count on international solidarity and partnerships to overcome the implementation constraints confronting us in our pursuit of the achievement of the water and sanitation targets in the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the Millennium Declaration.
Institutional framework
Inspired by the African Union goals of economic and political integration, which commit African countries to the principles of democracy, human rights, good governance, gender equality and people-centered development, we have adopted an institutional framework for the overall management of water resources in Africa.
In April 2002, African ministers responsible for water established the African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW) as a regional body to provide the political and strategic oversight of the management of water resources on the continent.
Recognizing, among other things, the importance of strengthening existing partnerships and the need to establish new ones, AMCOW has created a technical arm, the Technical Advisory Committee, to manage these partnerships in the spirit of mutual respect, responsibility and accountability.
Consistent with the policies of the African Union, AMCOW upholds the importance of equitable subregional representation and balance, which is manifested through equitable regional representation on its Executive Committee and the Technical Advisory Committee.
Under the auspices of AMCOW and using subregional mechanisms and intergovernmental bodies, efforts are under way to take stock of progress made in the preparation of national integrated water resource management (IWRM) plans and to assess technology support requirements and capacity-building needs in this area.
This exercise is being undertaken with the invaluable support of UN Water-Africa (the former Interagency Group for Water in Africa), the Global Water Partnership and our development cooperation partners.
In recognition of the role and contribution of AMCOW, in the Sirte Declaration on the Challenges of Implementing Integrated and Sustainable Development in Agriculture and Water in Africa, adopted on 27 February 2004, African heads of State and Government recommended that the Council's mandates, structures and activities be integrated into the activities of the Commission of the African Union and its specialized technical committees.
Regional economic communities can play, and in some instances such as in Southern and West Africa are already playing, an increasingly important role in coordinating water governance and cooperation issues at the subregional level.
Progress achieved to date, although uneven, has demonstrated that cooperation around shared waters can promote regional integration.
There is a need to strengthen these institutions and also to strengthen river basin organizations so as to enhance cooperation in the management of shared waters.
At the national level, we recognize that the overall responsibility for the governance and equitable distribution of water resources including assurance of access for the poor, hence water policy, lies with national Governments.
We are persuaded also of the need to include all stakeholders, especially women, in decision-making at the local level.
To this end, the capacity of local government structures should be enhanced to secure the efficient management and delivery of water and sanitation services at the local level.
AMCOW has sought to mobilize support to Governments in making relevant legislative and institutional reforms and implementing programmes to develop capacity in integrated water resources management, and developing and disseminating IWRM methodologies.
C. Setting water policy priorities in Africa
Building on the internationally adopted Ministerial Declaration on Water Security in the Twenty-First Century, which marked the emergence of an international consensus on the importance of water in sustainable development, the Pan-African Implementation and Partnership Conference on Water, held in Addis Ababa from 8 to 13 December 2003, confirmed the following eight key water policy challenges and priorities from the community level to continental level in Africa:
(a) Ensuring the knowledge base;
(b) Meeting basic needs;
(c) Securing the food supply;
(d) Protecting ecosystems;
(e) Managing risks;
(f) Valuing and allocating water;
(g) Governing water wisely; and
(h) Sharing water resources.
The conference also examined the African water crisis and identified the following nine major challenges:
(a) Tripling access to water and quadrupling access to improved sanitation;
(b) Closing the sanitation gap of the urban poor;
(c) Reducing high level of water-related diseases and deaths;
(d) Preventing water pollution in cities;
(e) Raising food security;
(f) Expanding irrigation for agriculture;
((g) Doubling hydropower generation and services;
(h) Reducing costs of water-related disasters; and
(i) Sharing water among sectors and countries.
D Implementation and partnerships
Over the last three years, AMCOW has made a number of ministerial commitments that constitute a set of needed measures to tackle the water and sanitation challenges in our region.
Since its inception in April 2002, AMCOW has concentrated on promoting implementation mechanisms and partnerships on water, with a view, in particular, to identifying how best to achieve, by 2015, the targets for safe water and improved sanitation through the development of strategic approaches.
That requires promoting better water governance and forging new partnerships on water, including the design and implementation of effective IWRM and efficiency plans.
Since the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, hosted by our continent, AMCOW has taken stock of the actions taken to date and agreed on the need to accelerate progress towards achieving the 2005 IWRM target.
Through the work of the African Union, AMCOW, NEPAD and other regional processes, priority has been given to mobilizing the crucial political commitment, as well as the necessary regional and national resources, for accelerated action in cooperation with our development cooperation partners.
Intensive work has been undertaken at the national, subregional and regional levels as already indicated.
At the global level, cooperative links have been forged with relevant networks and institutions and also with development cooperation partners to enhance the effective assessment of the present status of national IWRM implementation and systematic monitoring of future progress in our region.
In November 2004, at its fifth session, AMCOW considered how best to accelerate action to achieve the 2005 IWRM target, as well as the Millennium Development Goals water supply target and the World Summit on Sustainable Development sanitation target by 2015.
At that session we made a wide range of decisions and reached agreement on the necessary policy actions, which include:
(a) Strengthening the governance of AMCOW to make it more effective as a regional mechanism for promoting cooperation, dialogue and policy development;
(b) Adopting a triennial (2005-2007) work programme and, consequently, establishing the AMCOW trust fund, managed by UNEP with solid support from the European Union, to support the implementation of the work programme;
(d) Putting in place an African water facility, in partnership with the European Union, NEPAD and the United Nations agencies in Africa, which will be managed by the African Development Bank, and, highlighting the new forms of partnerships that need to be forged if the water and sanitation targets are to be achieved, a governing council consisting of five AMCOW ministers, five donor representatives, a NEPAD representative and a United Nations representative;
(e) Cooperating with the African Union in the context of the Sirte Declaration on the Challenges of Implementing Integrated and Sustainable Development in Agriculture and Water in Africa, adopted by the Heads of State and Government of the African Union at their second extraordinary session, held in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in February 2004;
(f) Cooperating with the G-8 countries within the framework of the G-8 action plan on water, particularly in promoting transboundary initiatives on international waters;
(g) Cooperating with the European Union to implement the European Union Water Initiative for Africa - the European Union-Africa “Water for Life” agreement;
(i) Working closely with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) on implementing the Water for African Cities Programme;
(j) Cooperating with the African Development Bank in the launching and implementation of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative;
(k) Strengthening collaboration with civil society organizations in recognition of their important role in awareness-raising, capacity-building and implementation of water programmes;
(l) Joining forces with the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council in its campaign on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH);
(m) Preparing inventories of major subregional water initiatives, projects and programmes in the five subregions of Africa in order to strengthen the assessment of progress made and needed; and
(n) Preparing a report on water policy challenges and priorities in Africa to inform and inspire our participation in the current policy cycle of the Commission on Sustainable Development.
Through the AMCOW consultative process at the national, subregional and regional levels, we have identified a set of policy measures and actions, which are listed below.
These actions form part of our efforts aimed at tackling the water and sanitation crises and challenges in Africa:
(a) Developing and implementing IWRM plans;
(b) Strengthening regional institutional and policy frameworks for achieving the IWRM goal;
(c) Enhancing water-use efficiency and prudently managing competing uses;
(d) Strengthening the management of transboundary rivers and lake basins;
(e) Expanding the participation of civil society groups, particularly women, and the private sector;
(f) Strengthening centres and institutions of excellence for water resources management;
(g) Increasing technology support and capacity-building for water resources management;
(h) Scaling up actions for improved sanitation in Africa;
(i) Ensuring water for African cities;
(j) Ensuring rural water supply and sanitation;
(k) Ensuring the explicit inclusion of water in poverty reduction strategy papers;
(l) Transferring urban revenues for rural water supply development and human and institutional capacity-building efforts;
(m) Allocating a fixed percentage of national budgets to water development and management; and
(n) Securing bilateral and multilateral aid to supplement the budgetary commitments of African Governments.
E. Creating an AMCOW road-map for the way forward in Africa ooops - this is the actual text that went forward to csd - so I fear we'll have to use this amcow - at least when quoting this para -
We, the AMCOW ministers, also recognize that a new strategic approach is needed if we are to be realistic in our efforts to achieve the water and sanitation targets.
For example:
(a) To meet the water target in sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 328 million people must gain access to some form of improved water supply by 2015, at an average rate of over 32 million every year, 630,000 every week and 126,000 every weekday starting in January 2006;
(b) To meet the sanitation target in sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 303 million people must acquire some form of improved sanitation by 2015, at an average rate of over 30 million every year, 580,000 every week and 116,000 every weekday starting in January 2006.
The goal of meeting the 2015 targets of the Millennium Development Goals in Africa is possible if the implementation process is strategically planned and launched in a practical way in January 2006.
For example, trying to provide safe water to an annual average of over 26 million people a year starting in 2006 would require an immediate doubling or tripling of the present delivery capacity in many African countries.
Such a huge increase in such a short time is an unrealistic expectation.
At the Pan-African Implementation and Partnership Conference on Water, held in Addis Ababa in 2003, we considered practical ways and strategic approaches to be followed in pursuit of the water and sanitation targets.
Our countries will have a more realistic chance to meet the water target by initially providing water to around 10 million additional people, starting in 2006, and then increasing that annual target and capacity by 20 per cent every year until 2015.
The following table shows how such a strategically graduated approach could achieve the target of providing improved water supply to over 267 million people and improved sanitation to over 292 million people in sub-Saharan Africa between now and 2015.

On the surface these figures appear daunting but they look less intimidating when presented in a more practical way, as water and sanitation services are generally not provided to individuals but to rural homesteads and urban households.
With an estimated average of six persons per household in sub-Saharan Africa, that means delivering water and sanitation services to around 44 million households over the period 2006-2015, starting with a target of around 1.7 million households in 2006.
Similar strategically graduated plans with specific targets can be prepared from the local to national levels in all our countries.
A set of such plans for every country and subregion was prepared and presented by UNEP and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) at the Pan-African Implementation and Partnership Conference on Water in December 2003.
Such plans provide a clear basis for assessing progress achieved and that still needed in reaching the 2015 water and sanitation targets.
But they also provide a practical basis for preparing the procurement and capacity-building plans on the expertise, equipment and funds needed at the local, national, subregional and regional levels in Africa.
Attainment of the 2015 water and sanitation targets of the Millennium Development Goals will only meet the needs of half of those in Africa who need reasonable access to safe water and sanitation: the needs of the other half must still be met.
If, however, our countries are able to maintain for a further three or four years the annual level of delivery achieved by 2015, the target of safe water and sanitation for all by 2025 could be achieved in our continent by 2020.
For a major international target to have been met in Africa five years before its global deadline would represent an unprecedented and historic achievement and mark a major milestone in the continent's humanitarian progress.
The poor of Africa, who constitute the majority on our continent, need and deserve such an historic success.
Beyond CSD-13: accelerating implementation and monitoring progress
The Millennium Development Goals for water and sanitation present a necessary and unavoidable challenge to political leaders and policy makers in and outside Africa.
We are aware of the need to establish, beyond the thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly to review progress in the fulfilment of the commitments contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, an effective mechanism for the monitoring and review of implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the establishment of a formal mechanism for such a review.
We wish to announce our intention to establish such a monitoring and evaluation mechanism for Africa, to be housed at the African Water Facility or an appropriate institution in the region.
To make the mechanism operational, AMCOW will take upon itself the role of ensuring regular reporting by member States coordinated by the regional economic communities.
A dedicated special Commission will undertake the analysis and review of the national reports.
The African Water Facility will provide institutional backup to the Commission.
The African review mechanism will work within the global review mechanism that we hope to see established.
We are moving forward, we urge you to join in us in our march towards a better future for our people.
