* Reissued for technical reasons.
Introduction
The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 was initially set out in the report of the Secretary-General dated 19 December 2002 (A/57/683 and Add.1) and subsequently revised in his report dated 19 September 2003 (A/58/381).
It amounted to $677,312,300 gross ($661,771,300 net), exclusive of the budgeted voluntary contributions in kind in the amount of $2,274,000, and provided for 10,040 troops, 760 military observers, 182 civilian police, 938 international staff, 1,299 national staff, including 25 national officers, and 419 United Nations Volunteers.
Based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions contained in paragraphs 5 and 55 of its reports dated 9 May 2003 (A/57/772/Add.10) and 20 October 2003 (A/58/447 and Corr.1), respectively, the General Assembly, by its resolutions 57/335 of 18 June 2003 and 58/259 A of 23 December 2003 appropriated a total amount of $641,038,300 gross ($629,390,800 net) for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004.
This amount has been assessed on Member States.
Mandate performance
The mandate of MONUC was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000.
The mandate for the performance period was provided by the Council in its resolution 1493 (2003) of 28 July 2003.
The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to maintain international peace and security in the region.
Within this overall objective, the Mission has, during the performance report period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below.
These frameworks are grouped by components: peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Transitional Government and elections, rule of law and human rights, human dimension of sustainable peace, and support.
The 2003/04 period is the first period for which the Mission was able to assess its performance against the planned results-based frameworks set out in the 2003/04 budget.
The performance report compares the actual indicators of achievement, i.e. the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement, and compares the actually completed outputs with the planned outputs.
Component 1: peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Component 2: Transitional Government and elections
Component 3: rule of law and human rights
Component 4: human dimension of sustainable peace
Component 5: support

Analysis of variances
The variance of $473,000 under this heading is attributable to increased Mission subsistence allowance requirements owing to the accelerated deployment of military observers, offset in part by lower actual average emplacement, rotation and repatriation travel cost ($2,613 per person one-way compared to the budgeted $2,750).
The variance of $12,129,400 under this heading is attributable primarily to the accelerated deployment of troops and the consequential increased requirements for standard troop costs, rations and contingent-owned equipment.
While the application of a delayed deployment factor in respect of additional troops resulted in the overall reduction of requirements, in particular for troop costs, by approximately 5 per cent, the actual vacancy rate for the period was 0.6 per cent.
The variance of $154,800 under this heading is attributable to the lower actual number of one-way travel of civilian police personnel (120 compared to 251 planned) offset in part by increased Mission subsistence allowance requirements owing to the accelerated deployment of civilian police.
During the period, 62 civilian police personnel were emplaced and 29 were rotated.
The variance of $3,869,200 under this heading is attributable primarily to increased requirements for Mission subsistence allowance and common staff costs for international staff offset in part by reduced requirements under international salaries.
The increased requirement for Mission subsistence allowance derives from the lower average vacancy rate of 14.9 per cent compared to the 30 per cent vacancy factor applied to the calculation of Mission subsistence allowance costs.
The higher requirement under common staff costs is attributable to service and family allowances being charged to common staff costs but budgeted under international staff salaries, combined with a higher percentage of international staff holding 100 series appointments.
The variance of $1,712,900 under this heading is attributable primarily to increased salary and common staff cost requirements arising from a higher proportion of staff at the G-3 and higher grade levels.
While the estimated requirements were based on the salary scale applicable to the G-2 step 1 level, 70 per cent of the staff were at higher grade levels.
The variance of $845,500 under this heading is attributable primarily to the slower than planned deployment of United Nations Volunteers offset in part by the increase from $2,219 to $2,428 of the Volunteers' living allowance effective March 2004.
The variance of $50,500 under this heading is attributable to the requirement for the services of an engineer specializing in airfield infrastructure rehabilitation projects, engaged for a six-month period from 1 November 2003 to 30 April 2004.
The variance of $1,318,700 under this heading is attributable primarily to increased requirements for administrative, logistical and substantive support to the sectors and team site locations throughout the country and Mission area in connection with the deployment and redeployment of troops and civilian personnel to the east of the country, in particular in North and South Kivu.
The increased requirements were partially offset by reduced training-related travel requirements owing to the prioritization of training programmes and emphasis on training organized in the Mission.
The variance of $13,618,500 under this heading is attributable primarily to the deferral to the next financial period of several airfield renovation projects because of the delays in the procurement process, lower requirements for generators owing to their transfer from other missions, reduced requirements for security, safety and firefighting equipment and for rental of premises resulting from the downsizing of the Kananga and Mbandaka sectors, the closure of team site locations and coordination centres and the non-expansion of the forward headquarters in Kisangani, offset in part by higher requirements for construction services and the recording, under this heading, of charges pertaining to diesel fuel for vehicles (see also paragraph 16 below).
The variance of $232,800 under this heading is attributable primarily to the recording under the facilities and infrastructure heading of charges pertaining to diesel fuel for vehicles partially offset by requirements for 16 additional right-hand-drive vehicles for the Mission's offices in Kampala and Entebbe, Uganda, and increased spare parts consumption for older vehicles given the poor road conditions in the country.
The variance of $6,541,300 under this heading is attributable primarily to the non-acquisition of navigational support and airfield lighting equipment owing to the deferral of airfield rehabilitation projects; the lower actual number of helicopter flying hours (14,433 compared to the budgeted 17,560 hours) offset in part by increased requirements for cargo transportation by the Mission's medium and heavy cargo aircraft to support troop deployment in the Ituri region, as well as actual master aviation third-party and air travel accident insurance premiums for helicopters.
The variance of $521,600 under this heading is attributable to the rental of fewer than planned speedboats and pushers.
During the period, seven speedboats and seven pushers were rented as compared to the planned nine speedboats and nine pushers.
The variance of $255,900 under this heading is attributable primarily to increased requirements for the acquisition of communications equipment to support expanded operations in the east of the country and increased military contingents' self-sustainment requirements offset in part by lower contractual personnel requirements for communications support services and reduced requirements for commercial communications owing to lower actual INMARSAT usage charges as a result of the downsizing of the Kananga and Mbandaka sectors.
The variance of $1,646,200 under this heading is attributable to lower actual expenditures on information technology equipment owing to favourable unit costs under the new systems contracts introduced during the reporting period and delayed implementation of the Microsoft enterprise agreement in respect of software licenses finalized by the end of the reporting period.
The variance of $685,300 under this heading is attributable to the increased self-sustainment requirements owing to the accelerated deployment of military contingents.
The variance of $1,456,500 under this heading is attributable primarily to reduced requirements for the short and long-term rental of commercial river barges, as the cargo movement requirements in the east of the country could not be supported by river transport, offset in part by increased requirements for military accoutrements as well as personal protection gear, including, in particular, ceramic-plated anti-fragmentation jackets.
