If any measures are necessary to facilitate the transition from the pre-accession regime to that resulting from the application of this Article, the Commission shall adopt the required measures.
Article 22

Tendering, contracting, implementation and payments for pre-accession assistance under the Phare programme, the Phare cross-border cooperation programme and pre-accession funds for Cyprus and Malta shall be managed by implementing agencies in the new Member States as from 1 May 2004.
The Commission shall adopt European decisions to waive the
ex ante
control by the Commission over tendering and contracting following a positively assessed Extended Decentralised Implementation System (EDIS) in accordance with the criteria and conditions laid down in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 of 21 June 1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89(
12
If these decisions to waive
ex ante
control have not been adopted before 1 May 2004, any contracts signed between 1 May 2004 and the date on which the Commission decisions are taken shall not be eligible for pre-accession assistance.
However, exceptionally, if the Commission decisions to waive ex-ante control are delayed beyond 1 May 2004 for reasons not attributable to the authorities of a new Member State, the Commission may accept, in duly justified cases, eligibility for pre-accession assistance of contracts signed between 1 May 2004 and the date of these decisions, and the continued implementation of pre-accession assistance for a limited period, subject to
ex ante
control by the Commission over tendering and contracting.

Global budget commitments made before 1 May 2004 under the pre-accession financial instruments referred to in paragraph 1, including the conclusion and registration of subsequent individual legal commitments and payments made after 1 May 2004, shall continue to be governed by the rules and regulations of the pre-accession financing instruments and be charged to the corresponding budget chapters until closure of the programmes and projects concerned.
Notwithstanding this, public procurement procedures initiated after 1 May 2004 shall be carried out in accordance with the relevant Union acts.3.
The last programming exercise for the pre-accession assistance referred to in paragraph 1 shall take place in the last full calendar year preceding 1 May 2004.
Actions under these programmes will have to be contracted within the following two years and disbursements made as provided for in the Financing Memorandum(
13
), usually by the end of the third year after the commitment.
No extensions shall be granted for the contracting period.
Exceptionally and in duly justified cases, limited extensions in terms of duration may be granted for disbursement.
4.
In order to ensure the necessary phasing out of the pre-accession financial instruments referred to in paragraph 1 as well as the ISPA programme, and a smooth transition from the rules applicable before and after 1 May 2004, the Commission may take all appropriate measures to ensure that the necessary statutory staff is maintained in the new Member States for a maximum of fifteen months following that date.
During this period, officials assigned to posts in the new Member States before accession and who are required to remain in service in those States after 1 May 2004 shall benefit, as an exception, from the same financial and material conditions as were applied by the Commission before 1 May 2004 in accordance with Annex X to the Staff Regulations of officials and the conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities laid down in Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68(

15
).

The commitment appropriations for the Transition Facility, at 1999 prices, shall be 200 million euro in 2004, 120 million euro in 2005 and 60 million euro in 2006.

PROVISIONS ON THE IGNALINA NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN LITHUANIA
Article 52
Acknowledging the readiness of the Union to provide adequate additional assistance to the efforts by Lithuania to decommission the Ignalina nuclear power plant and highlighting this expression of solidarity, Lithuania has undertaken to close Unit 1 of the Ignalina nuclear power plant before 2005 and Unit 2 of this plant by 31 December 2009 at the latest and subsequently decommission these units.
Article 53
1.
During the period 2004-2006, the Union shall provide Lithuania with additional financial assistance in support of its efforts to decommission, and to address the consequences of the closure and decommissioning of, the Ignalina nuclear power plant (hereinafter &#x2018; the Ignalina Programme &#x2019; ).2.
Measures under the Ignalina Programme shall be decided and implemented in accordance with the provisions laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 of 18 December 1989 on economic aid to certain countries of Central and Eastern Europe(
23
).3.
The Ignalina Programme shall, inter alia, cover: measures in support of the decommissioning of the Ignalina nuclear power plant; measures for the environmental upgrading in line with the
acquis
and modernisation measures of conventional production capacity to replace the production capacity of the two Ignalina nuclear power plant reactors; and other measures which are consequential to the decision to close and decommission this plant and which contribute to the necessary restructuring, environmental upgrading and modernisation of the energy production, transmission and distribution sectors in Lithuania as well as to enhancing the security of energy supply and improving energy efficiency in Lithuania.4.
The Ignalina Programme shall include measures to support plant personnel in maintaining a high level of operational safety at the Ignalina nuclear power plant in the periods prior to the closure and during the decommissioning of the said reactor units.5.
For the period 2004-2006 the Ignalina Programme shall amount to 285 million euro in commitment appropriations, to be committed in equal annual tranches.6.
The contribution under the Ignalina Programme may, for certain measures, amount to up to 100 % of the total expenditure.

The Ignalina Programme shall be, for this purpose, seamlessly continued and extended beyond 2006.
