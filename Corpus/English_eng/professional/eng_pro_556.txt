Statements were also made by two observers: Sao Tome and Principe (on behalf of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries — CPLP) and Palestine.
The general debate was preceded by statements made by the Chairman of the Committee and the Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information.
In his opening statement, the Chairman of the Committee noted the significance of the session, which was occurring during the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization and at a time of change.
He said the Secretary-General's reports presented for the consideration of the Committee clearly showed that effective reform and reorganization of the Department of Public Information had occurred.
The Department was the voice through which the United Nations spoke, and the Committee could strengthen that voice by giving the Department the tools it needed, he said.
The Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information, who introduced the reports of the Secretary-General, said that the Department had made measurable progress as a result of its reorientation, which had begun three years ago.
With the exception of the regionalization of the United Nations information centres, the Department had implemented those aspects of the reform proposals that were within the authority of the Secretary-General or were based on existing General Assembly resolutions and guidance provided by the Committee on Information.
It had devised a new mission statement and new operating model, and had reorganized itself to make better use of human and financial resources.
The Department had also set up new mechanisms to be more responsive to clients and had reached out to the media and civil society through new technologies.
As a result of its reorientation efforts, the Department had established four clear strategic directions for its work:
• A client-oriented approach that joins the Department of Public Information and Secretariat departments as partners
• Integration of new information and communication technologies at all levels of work that increase productivity and speed up delivery of services
• United Nations system-wide coordination that promotes the collective use of vital resources
• Strengthened partnerships with civil society and public and private sectors that create a global outreach
A fifth element, which ran through each of the above, is the institutionalization of a culture of evaluation into the work of the Department.
In taking up the substantive questions before the Committee, speakers emphasized the central role of the United Nations in global affairs and of the Department of Public Information as its public voice.
One speaker on behalf of a large group noted that the Department had an indispensable role in promoting a positive public image of the United Nations.
The work of the Department in this area should continue to be carried out in all Member States, particularly in the media of the host country.
Reiterating the importance of the Department's role in providing “accurate, impartial, comprehensive and timely information”, the speaker urged that there be a consistent message between the Department and any other entities that provided public information material on the United Nations.
Another speaker, also representing a large group, commended the Department for its efforts to meet the various challenges it faced in 2004, and also for its efforts to develop a more strategic approach to promoting global awareness and greater understanding of the work of the United Nations in priority areas.
In particular, the group welcomed the Department's approach to focus on key messages as part of a coordinated communications strategy.
Referring to the Department's role in promoting a positive public image of the United Nations, one speaker on behalf of a large group noted that the Department had to expend considerable resources to counter negative publicity in the media about the United Nations.
While the Organization should not be shielded from justified criticism, it was regrettable that this type of publicity had overshadowed the other areas of work of the United Nations.
“The United Nations is on many occasions not given due credit for its work”, another speaker observed.
One speaker, referring to the Organization's “mixed image”, said that the Department had been countering the negative publicity “valiantly and creatively”, but that there was no way for the Department to match the market reach of the conglomeration of modern media.
He noted that Member States should recognize that the United Nations received a lot of criticism that it did not deserve, “owing either to wrong expectations being placed on it by the public at large, and often by Member States too, or to outright attacks against the United Nations”.
Several speakers underscored the importance of the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization and the High-level Summit in September 2005.
A speaker representing a large group underlined the importance of coordinated activities in connection with the Summit, which he felt should encompass strong support for and the widest possible cooperation with national public awareness campaigns conducted by Member States with a view to bringing to the people better knowledge of United Nations activities and achievements.
Another speaker, also representing a large group, agreed with the observation of the Secretary-General that the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary would be a time of reflection and renewal, which presented the Department with an excellent opportunity to tell the United Nations story in a more dynamic way.
A number of speakers noted the importance they attached to the commemoration of World Press Freedom Day (3 May), which in 2005 would be observed outside the framework of the annual session of the Committee on Information.
According to one speaker, a free press was fundamental for true democracy, and it was important to recall the affirmation in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that “everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”.
Another speaker emphasized that freedom of the press was closely linked to sustainable economic and social development, which was a valuable tool to ensure the exercise of fundamental rights and liberties.
Another speaker representing a large group noted with concern that in many countries freedom of the press did not exist and that the dissemination of information remained controlled and limited.
However, another speaker noted that information often “failed in its intrinsic duty” and was misused for “infringement of sovereignty”.
Referring to reform in the Department of Public Information, a speaker noted that as a result of the reorientation process initiated in 2002, a transformed Department had emerged, which was serving the rest of the United Nations system well.
Another speaker expressed satisfaction with the Department's new operating model and the further integration of new information and communication technologies into its global communication infrastructure.
Another speaker described the Department as a “model department” that had shown an “exemplary ability to cater to the very varied needs of its clients”.
Agreeing that the reorientation process of the Department was complete, one speaker suggested that the Department should continue to integrate the culture of evaluation into all its future plans and programmes and review the quality of its products and services.
Another speaker on behalf of a large group stressed that self-evaluation and performance management were essential for the success of such a large and complex organization as the Department.
The speaker, who pointed out that 80 per cent of the Department's target audiences had expressed satisfaction in terms of the usefulness, relevance and quality of its products, services and activities, encouraged the Department to further deepen the culture of evaluation in every aspect of its activities.
Several speakers referred to the growing digital divide between developed and developing countries and called for greater efforts by the international community and the Department of Public Information to close that gap.
As a result of the widening gap, vast segments of the population in developing countries were not benefiting from the present information and communication technology revolution, another speaker noted.
A number of speakers also referred to the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society (Tunis, 16-18 November 2005).
According to one speaker, who addressed the meeting on behalf of a large group, the outcome of this Summit should provide for specific initiatives to be taken at all levels to assist in bridging the digital divide, as well as place information and communication technologies in the service of development.
The speaker urged the Department to continue to promote the Summit as an important international event.
Several speakers welcomed the Department's efforts to promote the “dialogue among civilizations and cultures” and commended the Department for launching its “unlearning intolerance” seminar series, which has so far included seminars on anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.
According to one speaker, the seminar on anti-Semitism had been “a very good step towards a situation in which Jews everywhere feel that the United Nations is their home too”.
Another speaker asked the Department to explore different ways and means, including utilizing the potentials and capacities of United Nations information centres in different regions and countries, to promote a culture of dialogue, respect and understanding among people.
Another speaker spoke appreciatively of the annual seminar organized by the Department on the question of Palestine, which this year will take place in Cairo (13-14 June 2005).
Several speakers singled out the United Nations website as an important source of information about the Organization.
One speaker described the United Nations website as “exceedingly effective, useful and well-organized”.
Another speaker, representing a large group, expressed support for the efforts made by the Department to strengthen the United Nations website in all official languages.
Expressing the group's concern at the continuing disparity among the different official languages on the United Nations website, the speaker urged that all efforts be directed towards addressing this issue.
Those efforts should conform with relevant General Assembly resolutions through the reallocation of resources and the deployment of staff to the required language posts, the speaker said.
Several speakers also underscored the importance of providing information in local languages and commended the network of United Nations information centres for their efforts to develop websites that catered to the needs of local populations in developing countries.
Another speaker, also representing a large group, welcomed the Department's efforts to further attract website users through a redesign of the site's top-level pages, including database-driven features, for easy access to the latest developments.
The speaker particularly welcomed the increasing compliance with the requirements for persons with disabilities.
However, another speaker asked the Department to provide additional information on accessibility by persons with disabilities and on the status of the project to establish a United Nations portal.
The speaker, while noting the growth in the overall number of pages viewed on the website, also asked the Department to provide a statistical analysis of the number of pages actually viewed, sorted by official language, and not just “percentage” increases in the number of pages viewed across language sites.
At the same time, several speakers called for the continuation of the use of traditional media, including radio and print, in disseminating the main messages of the United Nations.
One speaker, noting the Department's continued progress towards strengthening partnerships with radio and television broadcasters, commended the Department for launching a new radio programme dedicated to Africa.
A number of speakers commented on the importance of closer coordination between the Department of Public Information and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
Speaking on behalf of a large group, one speaker observed that such coordination was essential in ensuring the effectiveness of the information components in peacekeeping missions.
This was of current relevance to the international community in the context of the surge in peacekeeping operations and the allegations of abuse and exploitation in peacekeeping missions.
The speaker requested the Department of Public Information to provide specific information ensuring that the activities undertaken by the information components in peacekeeping missions were under the financial responsibility of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
Another speaker felt that the peacekeepers' job was greatly facilitated when local communities were aware of the benefits a peacekeeping operation brought to them.
The Department of Public Information and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations should fruitfully collaborate to ensure that the objectives of the peacekeeping operations were well known to the communities they were set up to secure, he said.
The new strategic directions taken by United Nations libraries were commented on by several speakers.
One speaker, addressing the Committee on behalf of a large group, noted that any change in the methods of United Nations libraries should continue to respect the previously agreed mandate and General Assembly resolutions relevant to libraries, as well as be subject to prior intergovernmental discussion and agreement.
The speaker also cautioned that the proposal to introduce technological innovations in the provision of library services should take into account the physical and other challenges faced by Member States in being able to effectively utilize such technology.
Echoing the same view, another speaker noted that what made a library a living experience was the availability of printed material, including books, newspapers and other publications.
The speaker hoped that United Nations libraries would not abandon their traditional role.
However, other speakers welcomed the proposed changes in library services and said that they supported the newly developed motto “from collections to connections”.
One speaker expressed confidence that the new model would enhance the important role librarians play, as they would be positioned to better assist their clients or partners in finding relevant, authoritative and up-to-date information.
A central focus of the general debate was the report of the Secretary-General on the further rationalization of the network of United Nations information centres.
According to one speaker representing a large group, the report of the Secretary-General had provided an assessment of lessons learned from the proposed regional model.
Based on this, the group endorsed the conclusion that no further regionalization was possible.
The speaker reiterated the group's view that the presence of United Nations information centres in developing countries, in particular the least developing countries, strengthened the flow of information in these countries and assisted in addressing the disparities faced by them in the areas of access to information and information technology.
The speaker, underlining the view of the group, stressed that any proposal for the further rationalization of the network of those centres must be in close consultation with the host countries, other countries served by the information centres and the regions involved, and must take into account the geographical, linguistic and technological characteristics of different regions.
In addition, adequate resources should be allocated so as to ensure the effective functioning and strengthening of United Nations information centres in developing countries.
Another speaker, also representing a large group, expressed the hope that the new report of the Secretary-General was not a preparatory measure to resume the rationalization process or the closure of United Nations information centres.
“The regionalization process is over”, the speaker observed.
Another speaker, expressing support for the proposal that Governments provide rent-free premises or rent-subsidized premises, underlined that any proposal for further rationalization, which could include the closure of United Nations information centres in the event these conditions could not be met, “must necessarily be in consultation with the host countries, other countries served by these information centres and regions involved, taking into account the distinct characteristics of each region”.
Presenting a different view on the process of rationalization of United Nations information centres, one speaker representing a large group reiterated that the policy of the European Union with regard to the regionalization of United Nations information centres had not changed.
The group members accepted the argument that the pursuit of regionalization must be tailored to the circumstances in each region and that the Western European model would not be applicable to all regions.
They also agreed that there could be “a certain advantage in taking a more gradual approach on this subject for the time being”.
However, a gradual approach “must not mean a static one”, the speaker said.
The countries in Western Europe had agreed to close down centres in their capitals on the understanding that other Member States would also take a similar decision in their own countries if circumstances warranted it.
Restating their commitment to regionalization, the speaker asked the Secretariat to “use fully the authority they have in making executive decisions on where best to focus their efforts” and advised them to make “bold proposals” for the approval of the General Assembly.
Another speaker, who commended the Department for taking steps with a view to strengthening the centres' operations, argued that for a variety of reasons, the information centre system continued to need further rationalization.
He said he was not convinced that the regionalization/rationalization process would have continued to move forward to the extent necessary to effect real change even if the United Nations information centre budget had not been cut.
The speaker reminded the Committee that the decision to reduce the budgetary allocation to United Nations information centres had been “willingly agreed by all”.
Another speaker argued that the rationalization process should not automatically be understood as a reduction in the number of centres, but rather as an improvement to promote a more systematic and effective flow of information and more active outreach activities.
The priorities of rationalization should be determined primarily on the basis of demand for the services provided by United Nations information centres and the availability of alternative means of access to United Nations information services.
The speaker reminded the Committee that currently about one fourth of United Nations Member States were outside of the scope of the Department's field information capacity and hoped that the rationalization of United Nations information centres would proceed in such a way as to strengthen the Organization's information outreach to those Member States currently remaining outside of the scope.
The Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information provided an in-depth response to a wide range of questions raised by delegations during the general debate, on 20 April 2005.
In a statement made at the final meeting of the Committee on 3 May 2005, a delegate speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China reaffirmed the Group's position in relation to the rationalization of United Nations information centres and observed that it was the understanding of the Group that rationalization meant improving the effectiveness and efficiency of United Nations information centres and activities of the Department of Public Information.
It was also the understanding of the Group that given the importance of United Nations information centres in developing countries and their core responsibility in transmitting the message of the United Nations, any improvements in the context of rationalization would not be to the detriment of the existing United Nations information centres worldwide.
The Group requested that this statement be reflected in the official records of the Committee on Information.
Chapter IV

Concurring with the view of the Secretary-General that the contents of public information and communications should be placed at the heart of the strategic management of the United Nations and that a culture of communications should permeate all levels of the Organization, as a means of fully informing the peoples of the world of the aims and activities of the United Nations, in accordance with the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, in order to create broad-based global support for the United Nations,
Stressing that the primary mission of the Department of Public Information is to provide, through its outreach activities, accurate, impartial, comprehensive and timely information to the public on the tasks and responsibilities of the United Nations in order to strengthen international support for the activities of the Organization with the greatest transparency,

Recognizing that developments in the information and communication technology revolution open vast new opportunities for economic growth and social development and can play an important role in the eradication of poverty in developing countries, and, at the same time, emphasizing that the revolution also poses challenges and risks and could lead to the further widening of disparities between and within countries,
Recalling its resolution 56/262 of 15 February 2002 on multilingualism, and emphasizing the importance of making appropriate use of the official languages of the United Nations in the activities of the Department of Public Information, aiming to eliminate the disparity between the use of English and the five other official languages,
