Human rights questions
Letter dated 20 January 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
On the occasion of the commemoration to be held in the General Assembly next Monday, 24 January 2005, of the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps in Europe, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has informed you, by Communication No. 31 of 11 January 2005, that it supports the convening of the special meeting commemorating that significant event.
Nevertheless, the Republic, inspired by the democratic and humanist principles of the revolution which guide its international relations of solidarity with the people and strict adherence to the truth, cannot fail to point out the following:
The fact that there are major democratic forces on the European continent which are opposed to the resurgence of Nazism and its xenophobic, racist, discriminatory and ethnocentric manifestations, which threaten democratic institutions of human coexistence on the continent.
Of course, these forces also exist in other latitudes and regions of the world.
Our revolutionary people and Government identify fully with the position of those progressive sectors, in the name of the interests of humanity as a whole.
A tangible demonstration of that commitment has been seen in Venezuela since 1939, when the country's people and Government gave asylum in their territory to a group of Jews who were victims of Nazi persecution in Europe.
Since that time, what has become the present Jewish community in Venezuela has lived in our territory free from harassment, threat or repression, in peace and harmony with the Venezuelan people, over the past 60 years;
The perverse political use which imperialist States and their allies have made up to the present of the crimes committed by some of them, defeated in the so-called Second World War, to cover up the atrocities they have been committing against peoples and nations continuously since 1945 without redress;
The identification and historical continuity between the war of aggression for the division of the world which took place between 1939 and 1945, and the war of conquest that the United States of America and its current allies have been waging against the peoples and nations of the world who possess strategic resources, from the second half of the twentieth century to the present.
It must be taken into consideration that the second war, characterized as worldwide, was inter-imperialist in nature, and was a people's war of liberation, in which the former Soviet Union played a decisive role.
This people's war of liberation was the determining factor in the defeat of fascism and the liberation of those who survived extermination in the Nazi concentration camps;
For the reasons given, we consider that, in the name of humanity and justice for the peoples of the world, on an equal basis as the commemoration of the Holocaust of the Jewish people in the 1940s of the past century, the collective memory of all human beings on the face of the Earth and the agenda of the United Nations should also include the sad remembrance and due commemoration, inter alia, of the Holocaust of the Japanese people at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, the crimes against the Vietnamese people from 1970 to 1975, the extermination of ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia during the 1980s, the extermination of the Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 and the massacre of the Palestinian, Afghan and Iraqi people currently taking place, not to mention other peoples who have been victims of similar situations, for instance what was done to the indigenous peoples of Latin America and other regions, all acts which were perpetrated, supported or incited by the imperialist States and their allies.
I should be grateful if this communication could be circulated to delegations represented in the General Assembly.
