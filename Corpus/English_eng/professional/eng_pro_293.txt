Joint statement concerning cooperation between Japan and the Federative Republic of Brazil on United Nations reform
Tokyo, 26 May 2005
This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the inception of the United Nations.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Junichiro Koizumi, and the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (hereinafter referred to as “both leaders”), based on a common understanding that this is the year to realize a reform to strengthen the United Nations, welcomed the report of the Secretary-General “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all”.
Both leaders stressed the need for comprehensive United Nations reform, including in the areas of development, security and human rights, and also stressed the importance of the revitalization of the General Assembly, as it represents the general will of all the Member States, as well as the importance of enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of United Nations agencies and organs in the social and economic fields, such as the Economic and Social Council, in order to effectively address urgent challenges.
They reiterated their resolve to further cooperate to make the summit meeting on the Millennium Declaration in September a great success.
Both leaders shared the view that the Security Council must be reformed to enhance its representativeness, effectiveness and credibility, so that it reflects the reality of the international community in the twenty-first century in order to effectively address today's challenges.
Both leaders, including in the G-4 setting, reiterated their determination to continue to support each other's candidature and to work together towards realizing the reform of the Security Council, by expanding the membership in both the permanent and non-permanent categories, including developed and developing countries in the permanent membership, together with other Member States.
Both leaders were resolved to work strenuously to accelerate their efforts towards the adoption of the framework resolution by summer, with maximum flexibility, and also called on other Member States to join as co-sponsors with a view to reaching as wide a base of support as possible.
