Human rights questions: implementation of human rights instruments
United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Introduction
Submission of the report
The present report was prepared in accordance with the arrangements approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 36/151 of 16 December 1981, by which it established the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.
The report sets out the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Fund at its twenty-third and twenty-fourth sessions, which were held in Geneva from 4 to 8 October 2004 and 13 to 22 April 2005, respectively.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights approved those recommendations on behalf of the Secretary-General.
The present report complements the report on the activities of the Fund submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session (E/CN.4/2005/54 and Corr.1).
The Secretariat informed the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session (A/59/353) that, as the annual session of the Board of Trustees of the Fund had been postponed to October 2004, a comprehensive report would be submitted to the Assembly at its sixtieth session.
Mandate of the Fund
The Fund receives voluntary contributions from Governments, non-governmental organizations and individuals.
In accordance with the practice established by its Board of Trustees in 1982, the Fund provides grants to non-governmental organizations that submit projects involving medical, psychological, social, financial, legal and humanitarian or other forms of assistance to torture victims and their relatives.
The list of organizations financed by the Fund in 2005 can be found in annex I to the present report.
C. Board of Trustees
The Secretary-General administers the Fund through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with the advice of a Board of Trustees composed of five members acting in their personal capacity, appointed by the Secretary-General with due regard to equitable geographical distribution and in consultation with their Governments.
In August 2004, the Secretary-General appointed the following members for a transitional period of one year: Ribot Hatano (Japan), Sonia Picado (Costa Rica), Ivan Tosevski (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), Theo van Boven (Netherlands) and Amos Wako (Kenya).
The renewal of the membership of the Board is in progress and should be finalized in August 2005.
The Secretary-General has requested that the criteria for the appointment of new members be elaborated.
He has suggested that such criteria could include the following:
(a) Members of the Board of Trustees should be independent experts acting in their personal capacity.
The principle of independence requires that the members not be subject to direction or influence of any kind or to pressure from the State or its agencies in regard to the performance of their duties.
It also requires that, as a rule, members not be financially associated with organizations benefiting from the support of the Fund;
(b) Members of the Board should be appointed with respect for gender balance and equitable geographical distribution, in consultation with their Governments.
Outgoing members should be replaced by members from other countries in the same region;
(c) Members should have wide experience in the field of human rights, in particular in the fight against torture, and knowledge of fund-raising, allocation of funds and project management;
(d) Members should be appointed for a three-year term, renewable once;
(e) Members should abstain from engaging in any functions or activities that may appear to be not readily reconcilable with their independence;
(f) Members should be able to dedicate the time necessary to fulfil their mandate.
D. Admissibility criteria
Project admissibility criteria are outlined in the Fund's guidelines.
They require a project to be presented by a non-governmental organization.
The beneficiaries must be victims of torture as defined in article 1 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (resolution 3452 (XXX)).
Priority is given to projects providing direct assistance to torture victims.
This could consist of medical or psychological assistance, help with social or financial reintegration through vocational training for victims or legal assistance to secure compensation for victims or members of their families.
Depending on the funds available, the Fund can finance projects to organize training programmes, seminars or conferences to allow health-care professionals or other service providers to exchange best practices.
However, grant requests for projects involving investigation, research, studies, publications or similar activities are not admissible.
The Fund can provide emergency assistance to individual cases in countries where no project is receiving support.
This type of request is examined according to a specific procedure outlined in the guidelines.
Detailed information on the various types of assistance provided through the projects financed by the Fund and their impact on beneficiaries can be found in the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session (A/58/284, paras.
Twenty-third session of the Board of Trustees
The Board of Trustees held its twenty-third session from 4 to 8 October 2004 and made recommendations for grants in the total amount of $6.7 million to 172 organizations in 61 countries.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights approved those recommendations on 11 October 2004 on behalf of the Secretary-General.
In spite of the limited resources available, and consistent with recommendation 3 of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the evaluation of the Fund (see E/CN.4/2005/55, para.
76), the Board resumed its practice of financing training and seminars, thus allowing health professionals, social workers, lawyers and other service providers to exchange experiences and develop new strategies to address the needs of torture victims.
The Board recommended an allocation of $57,000 to nine organizations for training to be organized between the end of the twenty-third session and the beginning of 2005.
The Board expressed satisfaction with the efforts undertaken by the Secretariat since its previous session to organize assessment visits to projects in the field.
From 2002 to October 2004, 58 projects in 16 countries had been evaluated by staff of OHCHR or United Nations field presences.
Visits contributed to ensuring that the funds received were used for the purpose intended.
The Secretariat also worked closely with field presences of OHCHR and other United Nations field presences, where possible, to ensure that the new proposals received complied with the Fund's admissibility criteria for the selection of projects.
No new project can receive funding before a pre-screening visit has taken place and a positive assessment made, confirming that all eligibility criteria have been met.
More detailed information on the twenty-third session of the Board is contained in the report of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session (E/CN.4/2005/54).
Twenty-fourth session of the Board of Trustees
At its twenty-fourth session, held from 13 to 22 April 2005, the Board recommended that $8.5 million be allocated to new grants, after the statutory deduction of the cash reserve for next year and programme support costs, to 186 projects in 68 countries for the year 2005.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights, on behalf of the Secretary-General, approved those recommendations on 27 May 2005.
In addition, the Board approved the paragraph on the Fund to be included in the joint statement to be issued on the occasion of the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture (see annex II).
Change in the funding cycle
During the session, the Board implemented recommendation 10 of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (see E/CN.4/2005/55, para.
76), following its evaluation of the functioning of the Fund, whereby “support from the Fund should be for a future period, rather than for one that has largely passed, and the funding cycle should be changed accordingly”.
The Board established that the funding cycle should be adjusted to the calendar year over a three-year period to ensure that by 2008 grants would be paid to beneficiary organizations early in the year.
It was therefore decided that grants allocated in 2005 and 2006 would cover an 18-month period, according to table 1, allowing for a complete new cycle in 2008.
In addition to the amount allocated for 2005, the Board also recommended that $3.1 million be paid to grantees in January 2006, contingent upon the availability of funds, to cover the first half of 2006.
Grantees will therefore receive funding in two instalments: the first will cover the period from January to December 2005, and the second, the period from January to June 2006.
Table 1 Funding cycle
Financial situation of the Fund
Taking into consideration the change in the funding cycle of the Fund and the fact that grants were allocated to cover an 18-month period, the Board had to rely on contributions from regular donors which had not yet been received at the time of its twenty-fourth session.
Table 2 indicates the contributions received for the attribution of grants at the twenty-fourth session of the Board, as well as outstanding pledges made by Member States.
It includes contributions received between April and July 2005, which have been allocated to grants recommended at the twenty-fourth session.
Figure 1 illustrates the contributions and pledges received during the period by regional group.

C. Recommendations adopted by the Board
The Board reviewed information prepared by its secretariat concerning 255 projects, including the analysis of narrative, financial and audit reports on the use of grants paid in previous years.
It also considered requests for new grants amounting to $14.1 million for projects to be implemented in 2005/06.
Figure 2 provides information on the geographical distribution of grants made by the Board at its twenty-fourth session, while table 3 identifies the number of projects subsidized in 2005, by region.
The Board continued its practice of financing requests for training and seminars, and recommended an amount of $50,000 for the organization of six workshops.
In accordance with the Fund's guidelines, the Board also recommended the allocation of $125,000 for emergency assistance to organizations encountering unforeseen financial difficulties during the intersessional period or to fulfil individual requests meeting the requirements of the Fund.

Table 3 Number of subsidized projects in 2005, by regional group
While more than half the grants disbursed at the twenty-fourth session were made to organizations based in Western countries, the recipients of that aid are mostly refugees or asylum-seekers from other geographic regions; however, the Board recommended that the secretariat be more proactive in identifying organizations in developing countries, in particular in Africa, that might merit funding.
It encouraged field presences of OHCHR to identify such projects and called upon the secretariat to undertake this activity during its regular monitoring and evaluation missions.
The Board also requested that the secretariat provide proposals to it at its twenty-fifth session on ways and means of establishing a budget line to assist organizations working on the rehabilitation of victims of torture through the field activities of OHCHR.
The Board was pleased that 72 projects in 28 countries had been visited since its previous session.
The Board appreciated the efforts made by the secretariat, United Nations field presences and United Nations funds and programmes to undertake evaluation missions of both ongoing and new projects.
It recommended that, in future, consideration be given to increasing the allocation of funds for evaluation and monitoring, which could amount to 1 per cent of the budget of the Fund.
The secretariat was also encouraged to continue its cooperation and exchange of information with other funding agencies, in particular the European Commission and the Oak Foundation, in order to better monitor the management of the projects financed by the Fund.
Members of the Board held a meeting with the Chief of the Resource Mobilization Unit of OHCHR to exchange ideas with regard to funding possibilities.
The Board encouraged the secretariat of the Fund to continue to work with the Unit in order to increase the contributions to the Fund and to find ways of increasing the allocation to the Fund of unearmarked contributions received by OHCHR.
The Board noted that work was progressing on the book, to be launched on 26 June 2006, to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fund, and recommended that a further $110,000 be set aside to ensure its completion.
The Board expressed appreciation for the requests to the Secretary-General made by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights in their most recent resolutions on the question of torture to ensure the provision of adequate staff and facilities for the bodies and mechanisms involved in combating torture.
It noted that the increase in the number of applications received each year would require strengthening of the capacity of the secretariat.
It recommended that adequate staff, equipment, materials and facilities be provided to ensure the efficient functioning of the secretariat of the Fund and the Board.
Members of the Board welcomed the information that a computer expert would begin to work on the computerization of the operations of the secretariat of the Fund in July 2005 and recommended that a further $100,000 be set aside to provide the secretariat with the necessary technological support.
Members of the Board took note of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the evaluation of the Fund conducted pursuant to paragraph 39 of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2003/32, which they discussed with interest.
They welcomed some of its recommendations, in particular those relating to the need to improve the geographical balance of projects funded, a more active role for the Board of Trustees in fund-raising and the multi-year funding proposal.
On the basis of the information available to it, the Board estimated that the needs for 2006, including with respect to applications for direct assistance and for training and seminars, would amount to approximately $15 million.
Report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the evaluation of the Fund
At the request of the Commission on Human Rights, the Office of Internal Oversight Services initiated an independent evaluation in December 2003, in accordance with United Nations regulations and rules, of the functioning of the Fund, including, in particular, the lessons and best practices learned from the Fund's activities, with a view to further enhancing its effectiveness.
The findings and recommendations of the Office are contained in a report to the Commission at its sixty-first session (E/CN.4/2005/55).
The following paragraphs provide information on action taken by the secretariat and the Board of Trustees to implement those recommendations.
Background papers will be presented to the Board at its twenty-sixth session to assist in making policy decisions on other recommendations.
Recommendation 1 was “more consistent application of the definition of torture”.
As the implementation of this recommendation requires advice from the Board of Trustees, it will need to be considered by the Board at its next session.
At present, when the secretariat is confronted with borderline cases, it seeks the advice of the Board; members of the Board are also consulted during the intersessional period on this issue.
Recommendation 2 was “clarification on treatment of family members” of torture victims, who are also beneficiaries of the numerous projects financed by the Fund.
Likewise, the implementation of this recommendation will require guidance from the Board of Trustees, and a background paper will be prepared for its next session.
Recommendation 3 called for “awarding grants for training”, in particular training of staff of grantee organizations.
Since its twenty-third session, in October 2004, the Board has resumed the practice of financing training and seminars, thus allowing service providers from different organizations to exchange experiences, best practices and lessons learned.
At its last session, $50,000 was allocated to six workshops.
Recommendation 4, “greater geographical balance in grant allocation”, called for a proactive approach by the secretariat in identifying potential grantees.
When reviewing applications, requests received from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean are given priority.
Those regions are normally considered at the outset of the session, while applications from the group of Western European and other States are reviewed at a later stage.
Since 2004, the secretariat has encouraged United Nations field presences to identify suitable applicants from regions that are underfunded when carrying out evaluations of existing projects.
At its last session, the Board recommended that the secretariat be more proactive in identifying organizations in developing countries that could be eligible for funding.
With regard to recommendation 5, “strengthened requirements for admissibility” for new applicants, since 2004 no grant has been released to a new applicant organization before a visit has confirmed that the eligibility criteria have been met.
Recommendation 6 called for a “more strategic funding formula”, inter alia, through multi-year project approval for three-year periods for projects with a good track record.
The Board will also be provided with a background paper on possible funding priorities and with possible proposals for multi-year funding when the change in the funding cycle is implemented.
Recommendation 7 was “better use of the Board of Trustees”.
It stressed the need to reinforce the role of the Board as a policymaking organ, in particular with regard to priority-setting and impact assessment.
At its next session, in April 2006, the Board will discuss a number of policy issues, and the secretariat foresees convening a meeting of the Board in April 2007 to discuss methods of work, guidelines for applicants and the secretariat, strategies, priorities and fund-raising.
Thereafter, a meeting will be convened every year in April to discuss substantive issues, while the annual meeting to allocate grants will be held in October.
Recommendation 8 called for “increased staffing”, taking into account the complexity of the issues dealt with by the secretariat and the portfolio of projects.
Two new staff members with strong backgrounds in management and information and technology have been recruited in 2005 to reinforce the present secretariat.
Recommendation 9 called for “strengthened management systems”.
An amount of $150,000 was approved by the Board of Trustees at its twenty-third session for the purchase or design of a management system meeting the requirements of the Fund.
At its twenty-fourth session, the Board recommended that a further $100,000 be set aside to provide the secretariat with the required technological support.
In July 2005, a computer expert began work on the computerization of the operations of the secretariat of the Fund, which will allow for the generation of statistics on the number, gender and age of the victims assisted and the types of assistance provided by the various projects financed, and will allow organizations to apply and report online.
Recommendation 10, calling for an “improved funding cycle” by allocating grants for a “future period, rather than one that has largely passed”, was implemented at the twenty-fourth session of the Board (see para.
9 above) through the allocation of grants for an 18-month period.
The same will occur in 2006 so that a complete new cycle will start in 2008, when grants will be paid at the beginning of the calendar year.
Recommendation 11 called for a “systematic and ongoing monitoring and evaluation system”.
Of the 238 currently active projects, 178 have been evaluated by staff of OHCHR and United Nations field presences since the year 2000.
A schedule of visits has been established whereby all ongoing projects will have been visited by the end of 2006.
Thereafter, follow-up visits will be undertaken every four to five years more often, if required.
In order to address recommendation 12, “enhanced reporting on Fund activities and impact”, the preparation of a book on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fund, to be launched on 26 June 2006, has begun.
The book will seek to demonstrate the impact of the Fund on the lives of victims of torture through the work of the organizations financed.
Other dissemination tools, such as a fact sheet and a remodelled web page, will also be prepared.
The computerization of the operations of the Fund will allow the secretariat to generate statistics on the type of assistance provided by grantees, the number of beneficiaries, their age, gender and other relevant data for inclusion in the annual reports of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights.
With respect to recommendation 13, “strengthened financial monitoring”, including a threshold for audit reports, the Board, at its twenty-third session, established that grantees receiving less than $15,000 are not required to produce audit reports.
The auditors of the Office of Internal Oversight Services have agreed to elaborate criteria, in accordance with international accounting standards, to facilitate the review of audit reports by the secretariat of the Fund.
In addition, a new staff member with a background in grant management and accounting has recently been recruited.
Recommendation 14 called for the “creation of a technical adviser roster”, an issue which will require a policy decision by the Board at a future session.
Recommendation 15 called for “commencement of capacity-building of grantees”.
It is foreseen that, in the framework of the ongoing computerization of the operations of the Fund, a forum will be designed allowing organizations assisting torture survivors worldwide to exchange experiences and perspectives online.
Recommendation 16 called for “stronger donor relations” and for grantees to be invited to donor meetings.
The Fund has accordingly strengthened its relations with donors: five regional meetings were organized for donors and the Chairman of the Board in March 2005.
Beneficiary organizations from the five geographical regions were invited to brief donors on their activities, thereby illustrating the direct impact the Fund has on the lives of the assisted victims.
Fund-raising will be a priority issue considered by the Board at its next session, together with the various policy issues indicated above.
The secretariat foresees organizing a meeting at the next session of the Board with other institutional donors to address the issue of greater synergy.
Needs assessment for 2006
On the basis of applications received for 2005, the Board estimated at its twenty-fourth session that requests for approximately $15 million should be expected for the year 2006.
If, at its next session, the Board were to allocate grants with a zero-growth increase compared to 2005, a minimum amount of $11.6 million would be required after deduction of the cash reserve and programme support costs, taking into account the fact that the grants allocated will need to cover an 18-month period.
How to make a contribution to the Fund

Conclusions and recommendations
Pursuant to the appeals by the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Board of Trustees of the Fund, donors are invited to pay their contributions to the Fund before March 2006 to enable the Board to take them into account at its twenty-fifth session, in April 2006.
The General Assembly, the Commission and the Board have also urged regular donors to increase their contributions, if possible, in order to provide the Board with the resources to meet the growing needs of torture victims and the members of their families.
The Board strongly encourages Governments that have not yet contributed to the Fund to do so for the first time, preferably before March 2006.

Joint statement on the occasion of the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, 26 June 2005
Recognizing that the lives of individuals, their well-being and sense of security continue to be scarred by torture on a daily basis, and that torture is reported with growing frequency from all regions of the world, on the occasion of the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, we, the United Nations Committee against Torture, the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the question of torture, the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights:
Reaffirm the concerns highlighted in our previous joint statements, re-emphasize the absolute nature of the prohibition of torture, including the principle of non-refoulement where there is a danger of an individual being subjected to torture, and stress that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as a justification for torture.
Recall the obligation of States to take effective measures to prevent all acts of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Stress that the importance of prevention cannot be overemphasized, and call for the universal ratification of the Convention against Torture and its Optional Protocol.
Urge the creation or strengthening of national preventive mechanisms which are mandated to undertake independent visits to places of deprivation of liberty, as required by the Protocol.
Remind States parties to the Convention of the desirability of making the declaration under article 22 providing for individual communications.
Recall the obligation of States to investigate and punish all acts of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment and strengthen efforts to fight impunity.
Recognizing the ordeals of victims and survivors of torture, both those who have spoken out and those who have suffered in silence, urge States to give effect to their obligation under the Convention to ensure that “the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible”.
Recall that victims of torture have a right to sue for compensation, including civil compensation, which can be based upon universal jurisdiction.
Urge the sixtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly to adopt the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law.
Acknowledge the achievements of the Special Rapporteur on the question of Torture, whose mandate was created 20 years ago, and stress the importance of his work in preventing torture and protecting potential victims.
Urge all States to issue a standing invitation and extend cooperation to the Special Rapporteur.
Recall that 10 years ago the Fourth World Conference on Women recognized that sexual violence and gender-based violence constitute torture where the State perpetrates such acts, consents or acquiesces to them.
Highlight the need to raise awareness of such forms of violence, including domestic violence, and to strengthen measures to prohibit and prevent, as well as investigate, prosecute and punish all such acts.
Note that gender-based violence, including domestic violence, plays a particularly insidious role in teaching and perpetuating a culture of violence.
Recognize the key role of non-governmental organizations in providing assistance to survivors of torture and call upon Governments, private and public entities and individuals to express their solidarity with victims of torture and members of their families by contributing generously to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.
