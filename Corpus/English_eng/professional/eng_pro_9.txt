Before taking up his duties each Judge shall, before the Court of Justice sitting in open court, take an oath to perform his duties impartially and conscientiously and to preserve the secrecy of the deliberations of the Court.
Article 3
The Judges shall be immune from legal proceedings.
After they have ceased to hold office, they shall continue to enjoy immunity in respect of acts performed by them in their official capacity, including words spoken or written.
The Court of Justice, sitting as a full Court, may waive the immunity.
If the decision concerns a member of the General Court or of a specialised court, the Court shall decide after consulting the court concerned.
Where immunity has been waived and criminal proceedings are instituted against a Judge, he shall be tried, in any of the Member States, only by the court competent to judge the members of the highest national judiciary.
Articles 11 to 14 and Article 17 of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the Union shall apply to the Judges, Advocates-General, Registrars and Assistant Rapporteurs of the Court of Justice of the European Union, without prejudice to the provisions relating to immunity from legal proceedings of Judges which are set out in the first, second and third paragraphs of this Article.
Article 4
The Judges may not hold any political or administrative office.
They may not engage in any occupation, whether gainful or not, unless exemption is exceptionally granted by a European decision of the Council, acting by a simple majority.
When taking up their duties, they shall give a solemn undertaking that, both during and after their term of office, they will respect the obligations arising therefrom, in particular the duty to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of certain appointments or benefits.
Any doubt on this point shall be settled by decision of the Court of Justice.
If the decision concerns a member of the General Court or of a specialised court, the Court shall decide after consulting the court concerned.
Article 5
Apart from normal replacement, or death, the duties of a Judge shall end when he resigns.
Where a Judge resigns, his letter of resignation shall be addressed to the President of the Court of Justice for transmission to the President of the Council.
Upon this notification a vacancy shall arise on the bench.
Save where Article 6 applies, a Judge shall continue to hold office until his successor takes up his duties.

If the person concerned is a member of the General Court or of a specialised court, the Court shall decide after consulting the court concerned.

Likewise, where the Court of Justice finds that an action falls within the jurisdiction of the General Court, it shall refer that action to the General Court, whereupon that Court may not decline jurisdiction.
Where the Court of Justice and the General Court are seised of cases in which the same relief is sought, the same issue of interpretation is raised or the validity of the same act is called in question, the General Court may, after hearing the parties, stay the proceedings before it until such time as the Court of Justice has delivered judgment, or, where the action is one brought pursuant to Article III-365 of the Constitution or pursuant to Article 146 of the EAEC Treaty, may decline jurisdiction so as to allow the Court of Justice to rule on such actions.
In the same circumstances, the Court of Justice may also decide to stay the proceedings before it.
In that event, the proceedings before the General Court shall continue.
Where a Member State and an institution are challenging the same act, the General Court shall decline jurisdiction so that the Court of Justice may rule on those applications.
Article 55
Final decisions of the General Court, decisions disposing of the substantive issues in part only or disposing of a procedural issue concerning a plea of lack of competence or inadmissibility, shall be notified by the Registrar of the General Court to all parties as well as all Member States and the institutions of the Union even if they did not intervene in the case before the General Court.
Article 56
An appeal may be brought before the Court of Justice, within two months of the notification of the decision appealed against, against final decisions of the General Court and decisions of that Court disposing of the substantive issues in part only or disposing of a procedural issue concerning a plea of lack of competence or inadmissibility.
Such an appeal may be brought by any party which has been unsuccessful, in whole or in part, in its submissions.
However, interveners other than the Member States and the institutions of the Union may bring such an appeal only where the decision of the General Court directly affects them.
With the exception of cases relating to disputes between the Union and its servants, an appeal may also be brought by Member States and institutions of the Union which did not intervene in the proceedings before the General Court.
Such Member States and institutions shall be in the same position as Member States or institutions which intervened at first instance.
Article 57
Any person whose application to intervene has been dismissed by the General Court may appeal to the Court of Justice within two weeks from the notification of the decision dismissing the application.

Article 58

Article 59

Article 60
Without prejudice to Article III-379(1) and (2) of the Constitution or Article 157 of the EAEC Treaty, an appeal shall not have suspensory effect.
By way of derogation from Article III-380 of the Constitution, decisions of the General Court declaring a European law or European regulation binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States to be void shall take effect only as from the date of expiry of the period referred to in the first paragraph of Article 56 of this Statute or, if an appeal shall have been brought within that period, as from the date of dismissal of the appeal, without prejudice, however, to the right of a party to apply to the Court of Justice, pursuant to Article III-379(1) and (2) of the Constitution, and Article 157 of the EAEC Treaty for the suspension of the effects of the European law or European regulation which has been declared void or for the prescription of any other interim measure.
Article 61
If the appeal is well founded, the Court of Justice shall quash the decision of the General Court.
It may itself give final judgment in the matter, where the state of the proceedings so permits, or refer the case back to the General Court for judgment.
Where a case is referred back to the General Court, that Court shall be bound by the decision of the Court of Justice on points of law.
When an appeal brought by a Member State or an institution of the Union, which did not intervene in the proceedings before the General Court, is well founded, the Court of Justice may, if it considers this necessary, state which of the effects of the decision of the General Court which has been quashed shall be considered as definitive in respect of the parties to the litigation.
Article 62
In the cases provided for in Article III-358(2) and (3) of the Constitution, where the First Advocate-General considers that there is a serious risk of the unity or consistency of Union law being affected, he may propose that the Court of Justice review the decision of the General Court.
The proposal must be made within one month of delivery of the decision by the General Court.
Within one month of receiving the proposal made by the First Advocate-General, the Court of Justice shall decide whether or not the decision should be reviewed.
