1 See A/60/228, table 2.
The Russian Federation had signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.
It provided a list of international treaties that it had ratified in recent years (2000-2005),1 including the following instruments:
• Agreement between States members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on a regional counter-terrorist structure (Federal Act No.
7-F3 of 5 March 2004);
• Protocol approving the statute on the procedure for organizing and conducting joint anti-terrorist measures in the territory of the States members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) (Federal Act No.
15-F3 of 2 April 2004);
• United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and supplementary Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, and Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (Federal Act No.
26-F3 of 26 April 2004).
The Russian Federation was in the process of decision-making concerning the signing of the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.
The State Duma of the Russian Federation had passed, on first reading, the draft Counter-Terrorism Act, which considerably enhances the State's ability to prevent and combat terrorist occurrences.
Federal Act No.
74-F of 21 July 2004 had amended articles 57 and 205 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which increased the penalties for acts of terrorism to as much as life imprisonment.
A Federal Act of 22 April 2004 had amended article 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, whereby persons suspected of committing crimes of a terrorist nature could be detained, as a preventive measure, for up to 30 days.
The following administrative and legal measures had been taken to prevent the financing of terrorism:
• Federal Act No.
115-F3 of 7 August 2001 on the prevention of the money-laundering and the financing of terrorism, in conjunction with the amendments and additions made to the Act in 2002 and 2004, had fully met the international obligations of the Russian Federation as regards combating the financing of terrorism and the relevant recommendations by the Financial Action Task Force on Money-Laundering.
• Presidential decree No. 1263 of 1 November 2001 had established the Committee of the Russian Federation for Financial Monitoring, a federal executive organ empowered to take measures to prevent money-laundering and to coordinate the activities of other federal executive organs in that area.
Under Presidential decree No. 314 of 9 March 2004, the Committee was reconstituted as the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring.
The provisions of Security Council resolutions 1267 (1999), 1333 (2000), 1373 (2001) and 1390 (2002) on the prevention of the financing of terrorism were implemented by Presidential decrees No. 786 of 5 May 2000, No. 266 of 6 March 2001, No. 6 of 10 January 2002 and No. 393 of 17 April 2002 respectively.
A Russian law, in force since January 2003, provides for an administrative procedure to suspend transactions involving money or other assets in cases in which any of the parties is suspected of being involved in terrorist activities.
Decision No. 27 of the Government of the Russian Federation of 18 January 2003 established a procedure for drawing up lists of such entities and individuals and disseminating them among institutions conducting transactions involving money or other assets.
On the initiative of the Russian Federation, the Eurasian Group on Combating Money-Laundering and Financing of Terrorism was formed, on 6 October 2004.
Based on the model of the Financial Action Task Force on Money-Laundering, the group is made up of Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation and Tajikistan.
In 2004, the Russian Federation contributed $1 million to the funding of institutional and other Group measures; it allocated about $3 million in 2005.
Between 2000 and 2004, 15 foreign nationals had been prosecuted for offences under articles 205 and 208 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
All but two had been found guilty by Russian courts and sentenced to terms of imprisonment accordingly.
Federal and international investigations had been launched against two foreign nationals suspected of organizing terrorist activities and committing a number of other offences.
In the Republic of Tatarstan, six people had been charged in 2004 in connection with criminal activities by Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami.
In two cases, the accused were brought before the courts.
In November 2004, two persons were tried and sentenced by the Moscow Municipal Court for a number of terrorist offences, and sentenced to eight and four years imprisonment.
In 2003 and 2004, the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation had considered a number of applications from foreign States for the extradition of 18 foreign nationals detained in Russian territory.
All 18 had been accused of having committed acts of terrorism or of organizing or participating in the activities of unlawful armed groups, or of being active in banned extremist and terrorist organizations (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami).
Applications for extradition were accepted in 12 cases.
The Russian Federation referred to the main anti-terrorism instruments prepared within the framework of CIS as a firm basis for stepping up effective joint efforts to combat terrorism.
The instruments included: the 1999 treaty on cooperation among States members of CIS on combating terrorism; the 1999 treaty on the procedure for the presence and cooperation of officers of law enforcement agencies in the territories of States members of CIS; the 2002 protocol approving the statute on the procedure for organizing and conducting joint anti-terrorist measures in the territory of the States members of CIS; and the 2003 agreement on measures to control international transfers of the Igla and Strela portable anti-aircraft missiles by States members of CIS.
In December 2004, in Brussels, the Russian Federation and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had signed an agreement that defined the legal and organizational parameters of the Russian Federation's involvement in the NATO counter-terrorist operation “Active Endeavour” in the Mediterranean area.
In July 2004, the Russian Federation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations had signed a joint declaration on cooperation in combating international terrorism.
At the bilateral level, the Russian Federation had established security and counter-terrorism working groups with the following countries: China, Germany, India, Japan, Pakistan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
The Russian Federation had also begun dialogue and consultations with Canada, France, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Italy and Poland.
