Financing of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone
Proposed donation of assets to the Government of Sierra Leone
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Introduction
The Security Council established the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) by its resolution 1270 (1999) and subsequently adjusted it in its resolutions 1289 (2000), 1346 (2001), 1389 (2002), 1436 (2002), 1400 (2002) and 1492 (2003).
In its resolution 1537 (2004) of 30 March 2004, the Council defined the configuration of the Mission's residual presence, which the Council decided would remain in Sierra Leone for an initial period of six months, from 1 January 2005.
In its resolution 1562 (2004) of 17 September 2004, the Council extended the mandate of UNAMSIL for an additional nine months, until 30 June 2005.
It is expected that the current mandate of the Mission will be extended until 31 December 2005, and the Mission is thereafter expected to complete its liquidation activities during the next six-month period ending 30 June 2006.
The inventory value of the assets of the Mission as at 30 June 2004 amounted to some $71.9 million, 12 per cent of which are proposed for donation to the Government of Sierra Leone at the end of the UNAMSIL mandate.
While the report on the final disposition of UNAMSIL assets will be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session and will reflect the actual disposition of property, it is imperative that the Assembly take action on the proposed donation of assets to the Government of Sierra Leone at this time before the expected termination of the mandate on 31 December 2005.
Proposed donation of assets to the Government of Sierra Leone
The process of identifying assets for donation was guided by financial regulation 5.14 and by section VII of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A and took into consideration the recommendation contained in paragraph 53 of the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/55/874) that the proposed transfer of assets to a host Government be submitted to the Committee for review and approval by the General Assembly prior to finalizing the transfer to the host Government.
During its presence in Sierra Leone, the Mission has served an integral role in the rehabilitation of the infrastructure of the country.
This rehabilitation included, for example, installation of prefabricated bridges, repair of airport runways and provision of transportation for Government construction materials used to build police barracks.
As the Mission now prepares to withdraw from Sierra Leone, it has reviewed its asset holdings and identified those that do not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations.
These assets, however, remain of operational value to local authorities, and the importance of the assets proposed for donation to the Government of Sierra Leone is pointed out in the twenty-first report of the Secretary-General on UNAMSIL (S/2004/228, para. 59).
Moreover, withdrawal of these assets could set back the rehabilitation process of the country, particularly since there still are infrastructural and logistical challenges faced by the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces and the Sierra Leone Police, as described in the twenty-second report (S/2004/536, paras.
23 and 55), as well as in the twenty-third report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/724, para. 12).
The inventory value of the assets proposed for donation amounts to $8.4 million, with a corresponding residual value of $3.8 million.
Detailed information and justification of the reasons for the proposed donation of assets to the host Government is provided below:
(a) Communications equipment (304 items).
The equipment proposed for donation, owing to normal wear and tear, does not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations.
These assets are earmarked for the Sierra Leone Police to assist them in the performance of their duties;
(b) Data-processing and office equipment (1,166 and 40 items).
The data-processing assets proposed for donation do not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations.
The remaining life span of these assets is less than two years;
(c) Accommodation equipment (362 items).
These items are air conditioners that are beyond their economic life span and do not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations;
(d) Generators (56 items).
These items consist of electrical generators of various wattage outputs from 4-105 kVA.
Owing to normal wear and tear and high maintenance costs, these generators are no longer considered cost effective and do not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations;
(e) Prefabricated buildings (539 items).
These items comprise 162 tents erected at transit camps, 171 Kobe houses erected at the transit camps and regional locations at Kenema and Magburaka, 21 ablution containers installed at the transit camps and 185 accommodation containers installed at various locations.
Due to normal wear and tear, the tents are not suitable for dismantling and re-erection.
The Kobe houses cannot be dismantled and re-erected.
The accommodation and ablution containers were received from liquidating missions in 1999 and have outlived their normal life span;
(f) Water purification equipment (6 items).
These units are installed at the transit camps to supply potable water and are recommended to be left in situ to continue facilitating the utility of these camps for use by the Government of Sierra Leone;
(g) Medical and other miscellaneous equipment (141 and 241 items).
The medical equipment and supply equipment proposed for donation does not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations owing to age and normal wear and tear;
(h) Petrol tank and metering equipment (2 items).
These items are hand tools and petrol metering equipment that are beyond their economic life span, and due to normal wear and tear do not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations;
(i) Vehicular equipment (148 items).
These assets comprise 95 light vehicles, 3 medium vehicles, 5 heavy vehicles, 1 forklift and 44 workshop tools.
These items do not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations due to their age, mileage and condition;
(j) Marine equipment (1 item).
This asset is a rigged inflatable boat used as a rescue craft.
The age and condition of the boat is such that it does not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations;
(k) Refrigeration equipment (60 items).
These items consist of 2 refrigeration containers that have been used as mortuaries and 58 small office refrigerators.
Due to their age and condition, these items do not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations;
(l) Office equipment (519 items).
These assets include an assortment of office equipment (25), including paper shredders, manual and electric typewriters, electric adding machines and currency counters.
Due to their age and condition, these items do not meet the requirements for transfer to other United Nations operations or for sale to other United Nations agencies, international organizations or non-governmental organizations.
Action to be taken by the General Assembly at its sixtieth session
The action to be taken by the General Assembly is to approve the donation of assets with an inventory value of $8,406,072 and a corresponding residual value of $3,829,178 to the Government of Sierra Leone.
