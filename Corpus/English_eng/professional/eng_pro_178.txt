Agenda item 31
Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)
Letter dated 31 January 2005 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
In accordance with instructions from my Government, I have the honour to refer to the letter dated 3 January 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Argentina to the United Nations addressed to you (A/59/662), transmitting in the annex thereto the text of a press release issued on 3 January 2005 by the Government of Argentina on the question of the Falkland Islands.
The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has no doubts about the sovereignty of the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas, and rejects the claim by the Government of Argentina to sovereignty over those islands and areas and that the Falkland Islands are under illegal occupation by the United Kingdom.
I should be grateful if you would arrange for the text of the present letter to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly under agenda item 31.
(Signed) Emyr Jones Parry
