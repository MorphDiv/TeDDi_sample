The architecture of the governance of Africa has been significantly altered in recent times.
The African Union has come into existence and serves as the over-arching regional body for the continent.
It was established to accelerate the process of political and economic integration within the continent.
The Union carries out this function by promoting and supporting cooperation between and among African countries.
Among its many other functions, the Union provides an enabling forum for African cCountries to work together to establish initiatives that promote proper development and use of water resources.
The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has as one of its aims the eradication of poverty and promotion of sustainable development.
In view of the above strategic considerations, regional cooperation between and among key institutions in Africa must be accorded top priority.
The outcomes of the Pan-African Implementation and Partnership Conference and the decisions of the African Ministers' Council on Water at its fifth of the 5th session on AMCOW, provide a sound basis for collaborative arrangements at the national and sub-regional levels.
Opportunities should be identified for strengthening the Council's AMCOW's presence and work at both the national and sub-regional levels as follows:
(a) Clear terms of reference should be drawn up for the AMCOW national focal points of the Council;
(b) At the sub-regional level, the involvement of regional economic communities and relevant intergovernmental bodies wouldill help secure greater collaboration.
Special agreements or mMemorandums of uUnderstanding on areas of cooperation wouldill provide strategic direction; and
(c) The AMCOW Council's Vvice-presidents for the five sub-regions should explore the possibilities of convening regular annual sub-regional consultations to monitor progress in the implementation of the CouncilAMCOW's decisions and work programme.
Suggested Aaction
The Executive Committee might wish to consider, with a view to its possible approval,
Consideration, for approval, of the specific recommendations of the TTechnical AAdvisory CCommittee.
