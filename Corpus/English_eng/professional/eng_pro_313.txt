Information on the programme of work of the Fifth Committee is not available as the Fifth Committee has not yet taken a decision on this matter.
The preliminary programme of work is prepared based on 13 weeks of work for the main part of the session.
Since there are fixed dates for the observance of United Nations Day, two official United Nations holidays and the scheduling of some items, owing either to long-time practice and/or General Assembly mandate, the weeks are counted based on the opening date of the sixtieth session on Tuesday, 13 September 2005, and the date of recess on Tuesday, 13 December 2005.
Agenda items and their numbers cited herein are from the preliminary list of items for the sixtieth session (A/60/50 and Corr.1).
All items on the preliminary list are pending approval by the General Assembly at its sixtieth regular session for their inclusion on the agenda and allocation.
Some items that are on the preliminary list are not contained in the draft programme, either in accordance with resolution 58/316 or so that they may be scheduled at a later date.
As the first item preceding the opening of the general debate, the Secretary-General will present his report on the work of the Organization.
The General Assembly Hall will not be available for meetings on Tuesday morning, 25 October 2005, to allow time for the dismantling of the stage and the checking of audio and telecommunications equipment.
Presentation of reports could also take place during the thematic debate.
A rolling list of speakers would be open one month before the beginning of the session.
Delegations are encouraged to limit the time of their statements to a maximum of 10 minutes, and statements on behalf of groups of countries should not exceed 15 minutes.
The list should give priority to high-level representatives and be regularly shared with the Committee so as to increase transparency.
Wide civil society participation is encouraged.
World Food Day is usually observed on 16 October.
From 1 November to 4 November, in observance of Ramadan, morning meetings of the Second Committee will be from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and afternoon meetings will be from 2.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.
The provisional programme of work was approved by the Sixth Committee at its 28th meeting on 18 February 2005.
