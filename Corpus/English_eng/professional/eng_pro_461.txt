Sixtieth session
Item 100 (b) of the provisional agenda*
Review of the implementation of the recommendations and decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth special session
United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research
Note by the Secretary-General
The Secretary-General hereby transmits to the General Assembly the report of the Director of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research on the activities of the Institute for the period from August 2004 to July 2005 and the proposed programme of work and estimated budget for 2005 and 2006.
The report was considered and approved for submission to the General Assembly by the Board of Trustees of the Institute at the forty-fifth session of the Secretary-General's Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters, held from 29 June to 1 July 2005.
Report of the Director of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research on the activities of the Institute for the period from August 2004 to July 2005 and the proposed programme of work and budget for 2005-2006
Contents
The present report informs the Board of Trustees of the activities of UNIDIR during the period August 2004 to July 2005 and the planned programme for 2006 and beyond.
Management and staffing
The work of UNIDIR is carried out with a dedicated small staff: a director, a deputy director, an administrative assistant, a specialized secretary for publications, a part-time computer systems manager, a research programmes and publications manager, a part-time conference organizer, a part-time fund-raising assistant, editors for the journal and for reports and books, and project researchers.
UNIDIR staff numbers continue to grow, and core staff members are on one-year renewable contracts.
A stronger core staff is being developed to reinforce the Institute's research programme.
All attempts are being made to increase the core and project income of UNIDIR, so that staff numbers can be increased and contracts can be improved.
Over the last year, UNIDIR had 29 staff members, 2 of which were directing staff, 3 support staff (administrative and technical), 5 core substantive programme staff, 12 project research staff and 7 visiting research fellows.
In 2004-2005, UNIDIR sustained its Young Researchers programme, hosting 26 young researchers from 20 countries.
Women are well represented on the UNIDIR staff: two thirds of the staff is female, including the Director.
The present report covers a period of institutional restructuring due to UNIDIR's needs as a growing institute.
The Institute is increasing its outreach — including developing a network of UNIDIR alumni — increasing the emphasis on skills development through training of core staff and setting up the computerization of the growing resource library.
Subvention from the United Nations regular budget
A subvention, used to cover the costs of the Director and administration, is necessary for the coming biennium.
Such a subvention is important not only economically, but also to ensure the independence of the Institute.
The subvention is currently set at $238,200, and is cost adjusted.
The cost-adjusted UNIDIR subvention in 2004 was $274,200 and is $202,300 in 2005.
In view of the importance of the United Nations subvention, continuing support for its increase and continuing cost adjustment is needed to facilitate growth in voluntary income.
A note by the Secretary-General on the continuing need for a subvention for UNIDIR was submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, in September 2004 (A/C.5/59/3/Add.1).
Recent and planned activities
The Institute research programme comprises three areas: global security and disarmament, regional security and disarmament, and human security and disarmament.
Global security and disarmament
Much of the focus of the work of UNIDIR is on global security and disarmament.
This includes research on the implementation of treaties already agreed and on issues relevant to current or potential negotiations.
Conference on Disarmament
UNIDIR continues to be actively engaged in a range of consultations on the issues pertaining to the work of the Conference on Disarmament.
UNIDIR is involved in discussions and seminars on Conference on Disarmament reform, the participation of civil society, fissile materials, nuclear disarmament, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, security assurances and outer space issues.
Nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation
In April 2005, UNIDIR launched a new research seminar series: Working our Way to Nuclear Disarmament.
Over a two-year period, the project will examine how States could realistically begin a serious process towards the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.
As part of that effort, in June 2005 UNIDIR held a seminar entitled “Eliminating Weapons of Mass Destruction: Prospects for Effective International Verification”.
In December 2004, UNIDIR and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) began a joint pilot project for the European Commission, Strengthening EU cooperative threat-reduction activities: programming community actions in support of the European Union Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
The project, which takes place over 20 months, is one half of a larger pilot project that also includes small arms, light weapons and explosive remnants of war.
The publication Disarmament Forum, issue 4, 2004, was dedicated to the 2005 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), held in New York in May 2005.
Papers such as: Is the NPT up to the challenge of proliferation?, Strengthening non-proliferation rules and norms — the three-state problem, A.Q.
Khan and the Limits of the Non-proliferation Regime, IAEA Safeguards and the NPT, Voluntary action in the fight against weapons of mass destruction and Contextualizing past, present and future challenges to the NPT regime were written by Rebecca Johnson, George Perkovich, Christopher Clary, Ben Sanders, Rose Gottemoeller and Rhianna Tyson.
The Special Comment was by the Director-General of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei.
As a further part of contributing to the preparations for the NPT Review Conference, in April 2005 UNIDIR hosted a day of NPT Round-table Consultations with the British American Security Information Council and the Oxford Research Group.
In March 2005, UNIDIR and SIPRI co-published and launched the book entitled, The 1995 NPT extension decision: an insider's view by Jayantha Dhanapala, which related the account of the former United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament and UNIDIR Director of the 1995 Extension Conference for the NPT, over which he presided.
The book was launched at a seminar, hosted by the Government of Sri Lanka.
Missiles and missile defences
Following the inconclusive final meeting of the Panel of Governmental Experts on the issue of missiles in all its aspects in 2004, the General Assembly in its resolution 59/67 requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report, with the support of qualified consultants and UNIDIR, as appropriate, taking into account the views expressed by Member States, to contribute to the United Nations endeavour to address the issue of missiles in all its aspects, by identifying areas where consensus can be reached, and to submit it to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.
UNIDIR is working with the Department for Disarmament Affairs to implement the resolution.
Biological and chemical weapons
UNIDIR and the Geneva Forum have held a series of meetings on the issue of biological weapons over the last year, including a brainstorming meeting on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, 30 Years of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention: Looking Back, Looking Forward, and The BTWC New Process: Prospects for 2006 and Beyond.
In addition, in June 2005, UNIDIR co-sponsored an international seminar with the Governments of France and Switzerland and the Geneva Centre for Security Policy on Biological and Chemical Weapons Threat on the occasion of the eightieth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Protocol.
The first issue of Disarmament Forum in 2005 focused on science, technology and the Convention on Biological Weapons regimes.
Topics such as the malign misuse of neuroscience, the assault on the immune system, non-lethal technologies, and the potential for professional codes were written by Alexander Kelle, Malcolm Dando, Katheryn Nixdorff, Nick Lewer, Neil Davison and Brian Rappert.
The Special Comment was written by Dr. Robin Coupland.
UNIDIR, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (United States office) and the Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute are working together to create a training programme to enhance the awareness of bioscientists of the safety and security risks, in terms of misuse and proliferation, that they face in their work and research.
Space technologies and space law
In March 2005, in partnership with the Governments of the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation and the Simons Foundation (Canada), UNIDIR hosted a two-day workshop on Safeguarding Space Security: Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space.
UNIDIR has recently published Safeguarding Space for All: Security and Peaceful Uses, a report of a conference of the same name held in 2004.
In addition, UNIDIR is currently publishing a book entitled Common Security in Outer Space and International Law, by Dr. Detlev Wolter.
Implementing treaties
Work has begun on a joint study with the South Eastern Europe Clearinghouse for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SEESAC) and the University of Bradford to investigate the costs of destroying small arms and light weapons.
In cooperation with the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, UNIDIR began a research programme in 2001 to study the role of regional bodies in implementing global treaties.
The research, headed by Dr. Lawrence Scheinman, includes workshops, an international conference and a report on the modes and mechanisms of treaty implementation activities by regional organizations with a view to assessing the value of devolving regional work to regional bodies.
In October 2004, UNIDIR hosted a meeting with the Arms Control Center's Scientists Working Group on Biological and Chemical Weapons (United States), the Verification Training and Information Centre (United Kingdom), and the NGO Committee on Disarmament entitled Should the UN Have a Standing Capacity for Weapons of Mass Destruction Investigations?
Security and disarmament thinking
UNIDIR's lexicon of arms control, disarmament and security terms entitled Coming to terms with security: a lexicon for arms control, disarmament and confidence-building, has now been translated into Arabic, Spanish, Hungarian and Korean.
It is currently being updated to take account of new developments and being translated into French.
In addition, in collaboration with the Verification Research, Training and Information Centre, UNIDIR has published Coming to Terms with Security: A Handbook on Verification and Compliance in Arabic and English.
In the last decade, there have been several attempts to reformulate the disarmament and security agenda.
A seminar series (co-hosted with the Department for Disarmament Affairs) on Disarmament as Humanitarian Action was established in 2000.
Following three successful seminars, in February 2004 UNIDIR began a multi-year research project entitled Disarmament as Humanitarian Action: Making Multilateral Negotiations Work.
The project is aimed at reframing and rethinking the ways and means for international arms control and disarmament processes so that the focus of international effort is on practical steps to benefit humanity.
The project held an expert meeting in November 2004 and published Alternative Approaches in Multilateral Decision Making: Disarmament as Humanitarian Action in 2005.
Bringing the private sector into approaches to prevent conflict has found increasing resonance in both the conflict prevention and the business communities.
UNIDIR, the Economic Commission for Europe and SIPRI have developed a range of initiatives and responses for the commercial sector to increase the security of the communities in which they operate and thus assist in attempts to prevent conflict in high-risk regions.
UNIDIR's project Exploring the Opportunities for Conflict Prevention Through Private-Public Partnerships aims to assess the extent to which international companies, in partnership with government and civil society, can support the development of security in conflict-prone countries.
To assist the process of United Nations reform, UNIDIR hosted a discussion meeting at Geneva on the report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change (see A/59/565) along with members of the Panel's secretariat and the Secretary-General's staff.
Information management and information security are two aspects of the information age that have major implications for international peace, security and disarmament.
In this regard, UNIDIR is developing a project looking at these aspects of the way in which the international system manages information.
A meeting on managing information in the United Nations is proposed for later in 2005.
Regional security and disarmament
Regional security has always been a priority in UNIDIR's research programme.
Over the last years, UNIDIR has focused on Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, North-East Asia, South Asia and Central Asia.
Peacekeeping
In order to support peacekeeping efforts, UNIDIR began a new project to include women in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes through better research, training and education in order to further the objectives of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).
This project has had an input into the United Nations integrated disarmament, demobilization and reintegration standards — a process that has identified the gaps and response required for effective disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.
Post-conflict needs assessment is a new approach that UNIDIR has developed based on the requirements of the Conflict Analysis Framework of the World Bank.
The aim of the approach is to develop a protocol to assist key post-conflict development actors assess the needs of local communities that have been embroiled in conflict.
The work is heavily dependent on intertwining the knowledge bases of the security, conflict prevention, development and anthropological disciplines.
In 2005, UNIDIR will begin a project supported by the Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship programme of the European Commission to study EU and United Nations planning for crisis management and peacebuilding.
In particular the project will look at best practices and inter-institutional learning.
Regional security fellowships
UNIDIR's fellowship programme has focused on regional security.
Eight fellows were brought from two regions to work collectively for six months at Geneva.
The aim of the fellowship is to provide new ideas for security policy in regions of conflict.
The two regions of focus so far have been South Asia and the Middle East.
Over the next years, UNIDIR plans to focus on the Middle East and North-East Asia.
Latin America
Las politicas globales, regionales y nacionales ante los regímenes de desarme y no proliferación de armas nucleares, by Marcelo F.
Valle Fonrouge, was published in late 2003; an English-language version is in publication.
As part of the contribution to security in Latin America, UNIDIR and the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean embarked on a multi-year collaborative project to establish a database on small arms and light weapons issues.
Asia
The second issue of Disarmament Forum in 2005 was focused on North-East Asian Security.
Papers on the security situation on the Korean peninsula, missile proliferation and missile defences were written by François Godement, Chung Min Lee, Charles L. Pritchard, Gu Guoliang and Hazel Smith.
The Special Comment was written by Professor Kuniko Inoguchi.
The Middle East
UNIDIR's lexicon of arms control, disarmament and security terms, Coming to terms with security: a lexicon for arms control, disarmament and confidence-building and its companion volume Coming to terms with security: a handbook on verification and compliance have each been published as a back-to-back English-Arabic volume to facilitate arms control in the Middle East.
Following UNIDIR's successful Middle East fellowship programme, the report entitled Peace in the Middle East: P2P and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, by Adel Atieh, Gilad Ben-Nun, Gasser El Shahed, Rana Taha and Steve Tulliu, was published in 2005.
As a result, the cooperative work of two of the fellows to implement trust and confidence-building measures in the Israeli-Palestinian context, continues with the War-torn Societies Project International (WSP-International) in the region.
A book entitled, Building a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East: Global Non-Proliferation Regimes and Regional Experiences, a joint undertaking with the League of Arab States, was published in 2004.
In March 2005, UNIDIR participated in a joint Department for Disarmament Affairs-League of Arab States Small Arms and Light Weapons capacity-building meeting in Algiers.
Further work includes a project to look at capacity-building and training in border controls in North African States.
Africa
UNIDIR's work in Africa has continued with its expanded focus.
Work in West Africa included the publication of Exchanging weapons for development in Mali: weapon collection programmes assessed by local people, by Geofrey Mugumya.
A project on transfers of small arms, light weapons and associated ammunition and parts within West Africa and their consequences on disarmament and conflict prevention initiatives in the region supporting the implementation of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) moratorium is now in development with ECOWAS.
Discussions on how UNIDIR, the Department for Disarmament Affairs and UNDP can help build capacity in the African Union have been evolving over the previous six months.
UNIDIR and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sierra Leone have collaborated on a joint study based on the findings of a 1,200-person survey on matters related to small arms, light weapons and personal security in Sierra Leone.
A forthcoming joint publication, From Research to Roadmap: Learning from the Arms for Development Initiative in Sierra Leone, illustrates the types of security problems people suffered in Sierra Leone following the recent conflict.
UNIDIR is currently working with some key partners in African countries on developing a New African Theory of Peacebuilding that will build on African experiences stemming from traditional practices rather than practices that are imposed from outside.
In addition, owing to popular demand, UNIDIR will reissue its book Bound to Cooperate: Conflict, Peace and People in Sierra Leone, with an additional preface to update it.
C. Human security and disarmament
UNIDIR is involved in academic and policy discussions on the topic of human security.
The joint UNIDIR-Department for Disarmament Affairs-Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue work on Disarmament as Humanitarian Action has been viewed as an important contribution to the current thinking on new approaches to security and UNIDIR's work on small arms, landmines and health security have made a significant contribution to the field.
The third issue of Disarmament Forum in 2004 looked at the topic of human rights, human security and disarmament.
Papers included such issues as defining and measuring human security, weapons of mass destruction and human rights, small arms and light weapons, human rights monitoring and armed conflict, and were written by Kevin Boyle, Sigmund Simonsen, Taylor Owen, Peter Weiss, John Burroughs, Barbara Frey, Michael O'Flaherty and David Petrasek.
The Special Comment was written by Dr. Mary Robinson.
In an effort to generate awareness about the relationship between security and human rights issues, UNIDIR hosted the exhibit “Building a Culture of Peace for the Children of the World” during the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights.
European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War
In October 2004, UNIDIR began a 20-month project for the European Commission entitled European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War.
The project is working to provide the European Union with a coherent set of policies on controlling the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.
The project involves a network of research organizations commissioned to write policy papers, a validation phase to test the findings and a series of meetings and publications to communicate the results.
The validation phase will incorporate capacity-building for border controls within the League of Arab States.
Weapons collection in exchange for development projects
Weapons-collection programmes to mop up the large surpluses of small arms that exist following conflict are now the accepted practice.
UNIDIR has carried out a detailed analysis of selected weapons-collection programmes in order to assist policymakers, donor countries, United Nations specialized agencies, and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to devise better strategies to collect weapons from civilians and former combatants.
Using participatory monitoring and evaluation techniques, UNIDIR has identified key criteria for successful weapons collection.
The project has studied the experiences of Mali, Albania and Cambodia and assisted work in Somalia, Kenya and Sierra Leone.
In September 2004, UNIDIR held an international conference to disseminate and discuss the findings of the project.
Four books have been published by the project and another is in publication.
One of these publications is an analysis of the research results and the implications for weapons collection and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.
Another is a comparative analysis of the methodologies that have been used in various evaluations.
Illicit brokering of small arms and light weapons
As part of a collaborative project with the Department for Disarmament Affairs, UNIDIR is embarking on a research project to study the issue of illicit brokering and its impact on the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons.
The project forms part of a wider consultative process to ascertain the views of States in line with General Assembly resolution 58/241 of 23 December 2003.
Geneva Forum meetings on Small Arms
The Geneva Forum is a collaborative programme started in 1998 between UNIDIR, the Quaker United Nations Office and the Geneva Graduate Institute of International Studies.
Part of the Forum's work is a series of discussions at Geneva on controlling the spread of small arms.
In the past year, the Geneva Forum held seven meetings of the Geneva Process — a discussion forum on the implementation of the Programme of Action.
In addition, UNIDIR has continued to collect information from States, NGOs and international organizations and worked with the International Action Network on Small Arms and Small Arms Survey to put this information into an online database, accessible through UNIDIR's website.
In late 2004, the Geneva Forum published a report entitled, The Role of Regional Organisations in Stemming the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons: Sharing Experience and Drawing Lessons.
Capacity-building for implementing the United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms
UNDP, the Department for Disarmament Affairs, UNIDIR and Small Arms Survey are carrying out a joint project to develop capacity in relevant countries to assist them in their reports on the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action.
The project has expanded to assist more States, including a series of regional meetings and a “caravan” in southern Africa, which comprises experts from UNDP, the Department for Disarmament Affairs and UNIDIR.
In addition, UNIDIR has carried out a timely analysis of the reports made to the 2003 Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons in order to help better ascertain where capacity-building was most needed.
The analysis was published in Implementing the United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons — Analysis of the Reports Submitted by States in 2003/2004, by Valerie Yankey-Wayne and Elli Kytömäki, and launched at a seminar with UNDP and the Department for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat.
A further analysis is being made of the reports to the 2005 Biennial Meeting of States.
The United Nations Coordinating Action on Small Arms Database Development Project was initiated in March 2005, with a view to facilitating collation and dissemination of information among Coordinating Action on Small Arms members as well as to Member States and the public in general.
UNIDIR will develop the country profiles section featuring country-specific information, including a brief needs assessment as well as an inventory of relevant expertise existing within Member States and that could be mobilized to provide assistance.
Security sector governance
UNIDIR and the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces have developed a programme of work on the Challenges of Security Sector Governance in West Africa.
Later in 2005, the Centre will publish a book from that project and launch the second phase of the research.
In 2004, UNIDIR participated in a conference in Abuja on the challenges of security sector governance in Africa, which was co-hosted by the Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution and the Centre.
Disarmament and development
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 57/65 of 22 November 2002, a Group of Governmental Experts was established to report on the relationship between disarmament and development.
UNIDIR was appointed as consultant to the study, which reported to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, in December 2004 (A/59/119).
Landmines and other explosive remnants of war
UNIDIR is working with the European Commission to develop a coherent set of policies on explosive remnants of war (see also para.
41 above).
The project has developed a network of research organizations commissioned to write policy papers, a validation phase to test the findings and a series of meetings and publications to communicate the results.
Research on explosive remnants of war, such as cluster munitions, is planned in the near future.
Health, human rights and security
The connections between security, human rights and health are increasingly of interest to the disarmament and security debate.
UNIDIR is cooperating with the World Health Organization, other United Nations bodies and NGOs on the effects of and issues pertaining to interpersonal violence and the spread of weapons.
The third issue of Disarmament Forum in 2004 was dedicated to human rights and human security (see para.
39 above).
The work of UNIDIR, the Department for Disarmament Affairs and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue on Disarmament as Humanitarian Action has focused on the health effects of weapons and UNIDIR continues to collaborate with the University of Liverpool on the long-term effects of the use of chemical weapons on civilians.
Networking
One of UNIDIR's main functions is to cooperate actively with specialized agencies, organizations and institutions of the United Nations system and with other organizations active in the field of disarmament.
UNIDIR has a number of formal and informal programmes and working arrangements with a wide selection of other organizations.
Electronic networking
In cooperation with SIPRI, the United Nations Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the International Security Network and the University of Pittsburgh, UNIDIR is establishing a database on researchers and institutes around the world on small arms and light weapons and other security issues.
The UNIDIR website has a networking feature that comprises two parts: e-di@logue and for comment.
E-di@logue is a discussion forum.
Short pieces are put up for wider discussion.
For comment is a way for UNIDIR authors to obtain comments on draft papers before they are published and a way to disseminate new ideas out to a more diverse audience.
Disarmament Forum
UNIDIR publishes a bilingual quarterly journal, Disarmament Forum, which has now been in publication for over five years.
Each issue has a theme related to security and disarmament.
There are papers by experts focusing on the theme and shorter articles on other subjects.
Summaries of UNIDIR current research projects and recent publications are contained within each issue.
Over 40 women experts have contributed articles to Disarmament Forum in the past five years.
C. Education for disarmament
The United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Education submitted its report to the Secretary-General and to the General Assembly in October 2002.
UNIDIR has now increased its work on disarmament education substantially.
In late 2004, during the meetings of the First Committee of the General Assembly, the Department for Disarmament Affairs and UNIDIR held a round-table discussion aimed at assisting States in their reporting on the implementation of the recommendations in the report.
Conferences, seminars and discussion meetings
UNIDIR holds a range of different types of research meetings both at Geneva and in different regions around the world.
The meetings are held with the dual purpose of examining issues of security, arms control and disarmament and of fostering cooperation with and among research institutes in the areas concerned.
UNIDIR includes as many women speakers as possible in its publications and conferences.
The UNIDIR joint project with the Quaker United Nations Organization and the Geneva Graduate Institute, the Geneva Forum, has held 20 meetings in the last year on a wide range of issues such as conflict goods, global security, biological weapons, small arms, firearms and explosive remnants of war.
E. Collaboration with other institutions
UNIDIR has continued to increase the number of collaborating institutes for research projects and meetings.
The biennial International Security Forum took place in October 2004 in Montreux.
As part of an attempt to improve the functioning of the United Nations system, there is renewed cooperation among the bodies of the United Nations system.
UNIDIR has increased its cooperative work with the Department for Disarmament Affairs through the joint project on Disarmament as Humanitarian Action, and through the involvement of UNIDIR personnel with the various group of governmental experts studies and the substantive support UNIDIR can provide.
UNIDIR continues to be a member of the Coordinating Action on Small Arms, an initiative of the Department for Disarmament Affairs.
UNIDIR is also continuing its collaboration with UNDP on small arms and development issues and is working closely with the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace and Disarmament.
In 2004-2005, UNIDIR provided the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with two researchers to assist in formulating UNHCR responses to small arms and light weapons.
A special issue of Refugee has been written with UNIDIR's assistance in time for the 2005 Biennial Meeting of States.
UNIDIR works with a number of other bodies within the United Nations system.
The Institute aims to support work towards peace and international security throughout the United Nations and is particularly interested in linking peace, security, disarmament, human rights and development together.
UNIDIR is participating in a series of meetings — the Geneva Research and Policy Dialogue — held by the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva to increase cooperation between United Nations research bodies and outside research institutes.
As a result of such meetings, UNIDIR has recently increased its collaborative work with other United Nations research organizations, in particular the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) and the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD).
In November 2004, the Geneva Research and Policy Dialogue was held under the joint invitation of the United Nations Office at Geneva and the United Nations University.
Research collaboration between the organizations has been fostered as a result of that series of meetings, in particular a collaboration between UNRISD and UNIDIR on research needs in the United Nations.
Fellowship and Young Researchers Programme
The UNIDIR fellowship programme brings visiting research fellows to Geneva for a period of one to six months.
The visiting fellows programme aims to: provide training for researchers from developing States; allow them to interact with each other, with researchers from developed States, the United Nations Secretariat, delegations and non-governmental institutes; and increase the quality of UNIDIR's work, thereby enhancing the utility of UNIDIR's information disseminated to Governments and institutes.
UNIDIR's increasingly competitive programme brings young researchers from all over the world to work at UNIDIR for short periods.
In the 2004-2005 period UNIDIR hosted 26 young researchers from 20 countries, including Argentina, China, Colombia, Ghana, India, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia and Uganda.
UNIDIR also hosts one Canadian Junior Professional Consultant per year.
Most of those partnerships are based on agreements that recognize UNIDIR as a legitimate provider of training for university students.
That means that students who are accepted at UNIDIR can obtain university credits for their placement internship or their internship can otherwise be counted as part of the university requirements for a degree.
Publications
UNIDIR is planning a large number of publications over the coming 18 months.
They include the quarterly journal, Disarmament Forum, and books and research reports.
Between July 2004 and July 2005, UNIDIR published:

Direct programme and administrative costs for 2006
In 2004 UNIDIR started two major projects: A Strategy for European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War; and Reinforcing EU Cooperative Threat-Reduction Programmes: Community Action in Support of the European Union Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.
These projects were largely financed by two European Commission grants of €1.5 million each and will run through to June 2006.
Upon approval of pending fund-raising applications, the provisions made for other research programmes and administrative costs are minimal and will be increased as funding comes forward.
(a) Salaries and related staff costs: $649,700.
These estimated requirements are needed to cover the salaries and related staff costs of UNIDIR regular staff.
In 2006 the regular staff will consist of the Director (D-2), the Deputy Director (D-1) and two General Service staff.
The total estimated requirements under this heading are based on the standard salary costs applicable to Geneva (version 20) and reflect no change over the 2005 revised requirements.
(b) Consultants' fees and travel: $20,000.
This provision will be needed to hire the services of a professional designer for the cover pages of UNIDIR's publications ($10,000), and consultancies for the study entitled, A Strategy for European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War.
It reflects a decrease of $47,000 over the 2005 revised requirements.
(c) Ad hoc expert groups: $67,600.
This provision, reflecting an increase of $29,600 over the 2005 budget requirements, will be needed to cover the travel expenses of experts participating in the expert group meetings for the project entitled, A Strategy for European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War and for the project entitled, Disarmament as Humanitarian Action: Making Multilateral Negotiations Work.
(d) Personal service contracts: $1,503,300.
This provision will be needed to extend the contracts of the staff in-house working on recurrent projects.
In 2000, the contracts were brought into line with regular United Nations contracts and in 2001 the related posts were graded by the Office of Human Resources Management of the United Nations Office at Geneva.
In 2002, the salaries were increased to bring net salaries into line with the related gradings.
The estimated requirements reflect a decrease of $1,650,900 over the 2005 revised requirements, as the project entitled, A Strategy for European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War will end on 15 June 2006.
(e) Official travel of staff: $40,000.
The estimated requirements for travel of staff in 2006 reflect a decrease of $63,600 over the revised 2005 revised estimates and will be used mainly by the project staff for A Strategy for European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War and non-project-related travel of staff.
Other project-related travel will be added if funds are received for that purpose.
The Director and members of the staff receive invitations to conferences and seminars which have to be declined because of the limited travel budget of UNIDIR.
On the other hand, they also receive a number of invitations where the costs are covered by the host institution: such travel will, at times, be combined with UNIDIR's missions, thereby reducing costs to the Institute.
Travel for fund-raising purposes will, as far as possible, be combined with travel for other purposes.
(f) Other specialized training: $2,000.
This provision, reflecting no change over the revised 2005 budget requirements, will be needed to train UNIDIR staff on new software.
(g) Other contractual services: $2,000.
This provision, reflecting no change over the 2005 budget requirements, will be needed to extend and expand the existing contractual services for the website and services related to the data-processing equipment.
(h) Hospitality: $2,000.
The estimated requirements for hospitality in 2006 reflect a decrease of $6,100 over the 2005 revised estimates and will be used mainly for the project A Strategy for European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War.
(i) Rental of conference room: $2,000.
This provision, reflecting no change over the 2005 revised estimates, will be used for the conferences organized in the framework of the project A Strategy for European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War in Cairo and Geneva.
(j) Rental of conference-servicing equipment: $2,000.
These estimated requirements, reflecting no change over the 2005 revised estimates, will be used for the conferences organized in the framework of the project A Strategy for European Action on Small Arms, Light Weapons and Explosive Remnants of War in Cairo and Geneva.
(k) Maintenance costs: $2,000.
This provision, reflecting no change over the 2005 revised estimates, will be used to extend the current data-processing equipment maintenance contracts.
(l) Communication: $1,000.
This provision, reflecting no change over the 2005 revised estimates, will be used to extend the current Nomadic facilities.
(m) Paper for internal reproduction: $12,000.
The estimated requirements under this heading will be used to purchase the paper for the production of Disarmament Forum.
They reflect an increase of $2,000 over the 2005 revised requirements.
(n) Subscription and standing orders: $2,500.
This provision, reflecting no change over the 2005 resources requirements will be used to extend the current subscriptions.
(o) Acquisition of office equipment: $5,000.
These estimated requirements reflect a decrease of $17,400 over the revised 2005 budget requirements.
They will be needed to purchase new printers.
(p) Acquisition of software packages: $1,000.
This provision is budgeted to upgrade existent software equipment and reflects no change over the revised 2005 budget requirements.
(q) Acquisition of facsimile machine: $1,000 — Stationery and office supplies: $1,000 — Data-processing supplies: $1,000.
Under these headings, the estimated requirements are identical to those for 2005 and will be needed to pay the leasing of the facsimile machine, the usual office and data-processing supplies.
Programme support costs
A provision of $104,000, representing 5 per cent of the total estimated expenditure less the amount of the United Nations regular budget subvention of $238,200 will be needed for programme support costs in 2006.
C. Operating cash reserve
In compliance with administrative instruction ST/AI/284, an amount of $283,000 will be kept as operating cash reserve.
It represents 15 per cent of the total 2006 estimated expenditure funded from extrabudgetary resources, less the expenditure related to the project entitled, Reinforcing EU Cooperative Threat Reduction Programmes: Community Action in Support of the European Union Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, for which UNIDIR has asked for exemption of the operating cash reserve.
