Sixtieth session
Item 121 of the provisional agenda*
Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit
Letter dated 27 July 2005 from the President of the Economic and Social Council to the President of the General Assembly
The 10-year review of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Copenhagen, 1995) and of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995) resulted in the following two Declarations:
Declaration on the tenth anniversary of the World Summit for Social Development (adopted by the Commission for Social Development at its forty-third session, 9-18 February 2005).
The declaration recognizes in paragraph 2 that “the implementation of the Copenhagen commitments and the attainment of the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, are mutually reinforcing and that the Copenhagen commitments are crucial to a coherent, people-centred approach to development”.
Declaration of the Commission on the Status of Women on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-ninth session, 28 February-11 March 2005).
The declaration emphasizes in paragraph 3 that “the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action is essential to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and [stresses] the need to ensure the integration of a gender perspective in the high-level plenary meeting on the review of the Millennium Declaration”.
In response to Economic and Social Council resolution 2004/58 and decision 2004/309, in which the Commissions were requested to transmit the declarations through the Economic and Social Council to the General Assembly, the two Commissions requested the Council in their reports (E/2005/26 and E/2005/27) to transmit the declarations to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.
The Council, at its substantive session of 2005, held from 29 June to 27 July 2005, took note of this request.
I would, therefore, appreciate if you could transmit the two declarations* to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session, including the World Summit.
I would also like to bring to your attention that, in both the high-level and coordination segments of the Economic and Social Council, we discussed the publication issued by the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination on “One United Nations: catalyst for progress and change”.
This publication, which describes the United Nations system's response to the Millennium Declaration and the way ahead for the system, is also highly relevant to the work of the World Summit.
