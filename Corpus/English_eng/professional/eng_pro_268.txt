Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 108
Programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005
Strengthened and unified security management system for the United Nations: standardized access control
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on a strengthened and unified security management system for the United Nations: standardized access control (A/59/776).
The General Assembly, in its resolution 59/276 of 23 December 2004, decided to defer until the second part of its resumed fifty-ninth session consideration of the Secretary-General's proposal on the global access control system, pending receipt of a detailed report of the Secretary-General.
The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General intends to address the General Assembly's request in detail in a comprehensive progress report to be submitted at its sixtieth session.
In the interim, the Department of Safety and Security intends to comprehensively assess security requirements relating to access control and formulate a strategic global approach.
The Committee was informed that it is intended to establish a project access control team, comprising internal and external (consultant) security experts, to develop an implementation strategy.
Requirements for specialized outside consultant expertise is projected at $180,000 from within the overall resources approved for the biennium 2004-2005 and included within the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 under section 33, Safety and security.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the eventual aim of the standardized access system was to find the right balance between measures to be implemented and perceived security threats.
The Committee was also informed that cooperative activities had been undertaken with United Nations funds and programmes whose staff would require regular access to United Nations facilities worldwide.
The planned access measures would include United Nations Headquarters facilities as well as other offices away from Headquarters.
The Department of Safety and Security is taking steps to ensure that a full understanding of secure access is reached at all United Nations locations.
The report of the Secretary-General (para.
3) includes the following anticipated project time frames:
• Planning and preliminary design of the project: 6-9 months
• Implementation phase: 18-24 months
• Total project duration: 24-33 months.
The Advisory Committee looks forward to a more developed time frame in the report to be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.
The Committee was informed that necessary measures will be taken to meet perceived immediate threats pending completion of the project.
The Committee sees merit in the careful and measured approach presented in the report of the Secretary-General to proceed incrementally to ensure that the new access system will be balanced against the perceived threat to United Nations facilities.
The Committee recommends that the General Assembly take note of the report of the Secretary-General on standardized access control with the expectation that a comprehensive progress report will be presented during the sixtieth session.
