Convinced that human rights education is a long-term and lifelong process through which everyone learns tolerance and respect for the dignity of others and the means and methods of ensuring that respect in all societies,
Believing that human rights education is essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and contributes significantly to promoting equality, preventing conflict and human rights violations and enhancing participation and democratic processes, with a view to developing societies in which all human beings are valued and respected,
Welcoming the proclamation by the General Assembly on 10 December 2004 of the World Programme for Human Rights Education, structured in consecutive phases, which began on 1 January 2005,
Adopts the revised draft plan of action for the first phase (2005-2007) of the World Programme for Human Rights Education, which focuses on primary and secondary school systems;
Encourages all States to develop initiatives within the World Programme for Human Rights Education and, in particular, to implement, within their capabilities, the revised draft plan of action;
Requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in close cooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, to promote the national implementation of the revised draft plan of action, provide relevant technical assistance when requested and coordinate related international efforts;
Appeals to relevant organs, bodies or agencies of the United Nations system, as well as all other international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, within their respective mandates, to promote and technically assist, when requested, the national implementation of the revised draft plan of action;
Calls upon all existing national human rights institutions to assist in the implementation of human rights education programmes consistent with the revised draft plan of action;
Requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to widely disseminate among States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations the revised draft plan of action.
