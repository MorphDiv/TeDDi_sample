Sixth Meeting
Zagreb, 28 November - 2 December 2005
Item 12 of the provisional agenda
Consideration of matters arising from/in
the context of reports submitted under Article 7
Presented by Argentina and Chile
Background
At the 1999 First Meeting of the States Parties, the States Parties adopted a reporting format to facilitate transparency reporting as required under Article 7 of the Convention.
At the 2000 Second Meeting of the States Parties, the States Parties reviewed the technical ways and means of circulating reports, adopting Form J to provide States Parties with an opportunity to report voluntarily on matters pertaining to compliance and implementation not covered by the formal reporting requirements contained in Article 7, particularly to report on assistance for the care and rehabilitation, and social and economic reintegration, of mine victims.
At the 2002 Fourth Meeting of the States Parties, the States Parties again reviewed the technical ways and means of circulating reports, encouraging the maximization of the potential of the reporting format as an important tool to measure progress and communicate needs with a view to facilitating cooperation and assistance efforts.
In addition, a cover page was tabled as a means of facilitating reporting by States Parties whose transparency information changes little - if at all - from year to year.
In summary, the States Parties continually have reviewed their reporting methods to ensure an efficient and effective exchange of information -information that is required for States Parties to provide and other information that States Parties may wish to share to facilitate implementation.
The States Parties emphasised this point in the Nairobi Action Plan, stating that “transparency and the open exchange of information have been essential pillars on which the Convention's practices, procedures and tradition of partnership have been built, through both formal means and informal means” and that “transparency and effective information exchange will be equally crucial to fulfilling their obligations during the period 2005-2009.”
With particular regard to information on mines retained in accordance with the exceptions in Article 3, the States Parties agreed in Action #54 of the Nairobi Action Plan that States Parties that have retained such mines should “provide information on the plans requiring the retention of mines for the development of and training in mine detection, mine clearance, or mine destruction techniques and report on the actual use of retained mines and the results of such use.” Article 7 does not state that the provision of such information is obligatory.
However, many States Parties have already indicated their willingness to volunteer such information.
Hence, providing them with a standardised means of doing so may be of assistance to them and enable others to also provide such information should they wish.
Current situation
Form D of the Article 7 reporting format currently includes three tables enabling States Parties to provide required information, as follows:
Retained for development of and training in (Article 3, para.1)
The types, quantities and, if possible, lot numbers of all anti-personnel mines retained for the development of and training in mine detection, mine clearance or mine destruction techniques, as well as the institutions authorized by a State Party to retain anti-personnel mines in accordance with Article 3.
Transferred for development of and training in (Article 3, para.1)
The types, quantities and, if possible, lot numbers of all anti-personnel mines transferred for the development of and training in mine detection, mine clearance or mine destruction techniques, as well as the institutions authorized by a State Party to transfer anti-personnel mines in accordance with Article 3.
Transferred for the purpose of destruction (Article 3, para.2)
The types, quantities and, if possible, lot numbers of all anti-personnel mines transferred for the purpose of destruction, as well as the institutions authorized by a State Party to transfer anti-personnel mines in accordance with Article 3.
Proposal
In order to facilitate the application of Action #54 of the Nairobi Action Plan, it is proposed that Form D of the Article 7 reporting format be amended to provide an opportunity for States Parties to “provide information on the plans requiring the retention of mines for the development of and training in mine detection, mine clearance, or mine destruction techniques and report on the actual use of retained mines and the results of such use.”
In particular, it is proposed that the existing table 1 be renumbered as table 1a and that the following two tables be added, as indicated in the attached annex, to provide States Parties with an opportunity to volunteer the following information:
1b.
Actual development of and training in (Article 3, para.1)
The permitted purpose for which mines were used, the activity or project in which these mines were used, progress made or objectives realized in the use of these mines, the types and quantities of mines used and any other relevant information (e.g., the location of the use of the mines).
1c.
Future development of and training in (Article 3, para.1)
The permitted purpose for which mines are intended to be used, the activity or project in which these mines will be used, details of the plans or objectives of the projects in which the mines will be used, quantitative details on these projects (e.g., the numbers of individuals to be trained, the number of dogs to be tested, etc.), the time period when these mines will be used, the types and numbers of mines which likely will be used, and any other relevant information.
Conclusion
Information on mines retained under Article 3 that States Parties are required to provide in accordance with Article 7 relates to quantity.
However, many States Parties have expressed an interest in sharing, on a voluntary basis, information on the utility of retained mines.
The essence of this proposal combines these concepts of quantity and utility, enabling States Parties to efficiently and effectively share information on both quantity and use, and, to provide both required and additional information.
