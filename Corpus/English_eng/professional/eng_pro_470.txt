Sixtieth session
Request for the inclusion of an item in the provisional agenda of the sixtieth session
Observer status for the Latin American Integration Association in the General Assembly
Letter dated 15 July 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
In accordance with the decision adopted on 16 February 2005 by the Committee of Representatives of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI), which is currently being chaired by Ecuador, and in keeping with Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, I have the honour to request the inclusion in the provisional agenda of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly the item entitled “Observer status for the Latin American Integration Association in the General Assembly”.
The Latin American Integration Association is an international and intergovernmental organization whose objective is to promote the socio-economic development of the twelve countries which are members, with the ultimate aim of establishing a Latin American common market.
Its current Secretary-General is Didier Opertti Badan.
In fulfilment of Rule 20 of the aforementioned Rules of Procedure, an explanatory memorandum on the nature and description of the organization (see annex I) and the relevant draft resolution (see annex II) are annexed to this letter.
I should be grateful if you would circulate this letter and its annexes as a document of the General Assembly.
(Signed) Jaime Moncayo Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations
Annex I
Explanatory memorandum
The Latin American Integration Association was established by the Treaty of Montevideo in 1980 and is made up of twelve member countries: the United Mexican States, the Argentine Republic, the Republic of Bolivia, the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Republic of Chile, the Republic of Colombia, the Republic of Cuba, the Republic of Ecuador, the Republic of Paraguay, the Republic of Peru, the Eastern Republic of Uruguay and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
In accordance with article 1 of the Treaty, the member countries agree to pursue the regional integration process begun in 1980 with the Latin American Free Trade Association to promote the harmonious and balanced socio-economic development of the region, with the long-term objective of the gradual and progressive establishment of a Latin American common market.
The three basic duties of the Latin American Integration Association are the promotion and regulation of reciprocal trade, economic complementation and the development of economic cooperation actions encouraging market expansion.
In order to fulfil those duties, the member countries established an area of economic preferences, composed of a regional tariff preference (RTP), regional scope agreements (RSA) and partial scope agreements (PSA).
It is also important to note that actions towards the achievement of the long-term objective mentioned above are governed by five principles: pluralism, convergence, differential treatment, multiplicity and flexibility.
In accordance with the latter, the development of an integration process of variable configuration was facilitated, according to the specific needs of countries and varying economic conditions.
The regional integration process has been described as a pragmatic framework to equalize the heterogeneous nature of the region and as channelling through an institution the will of its member countries.
This dynamic has been developing into a flexible legal framework that, without commitments established in advance, includes all the elements to allow the framework to evolve towards higher levels of economic integration and, in the long term, to attain the objective of a Latin American common market, in accordance with article 1 of the Treaty.
This legal framework, with its functions, mechanisms and principles, has permitted and facilitated the development of the integration process in the region through the formation of a complex and dynamic structure of trade relationships of various degrees of depth and commitment.
For the purpose of achieving the optimum level of effective collaboration and interaction between the Association and the United Nations, it would be appropriate to consolidate their mutual relations on a regular and structured bases.
The granting of observer status in the General Assembly to the Association would contribute to that aim.
It would enable the interaction between the Association and the United Nations to be strengthened and would expand the ability of both to promote development and cooperation at both the regional and the global level.
Annex II

Taking into account the desire of the Latin American Integration Association to intensify its collaboration with the United Nations,
