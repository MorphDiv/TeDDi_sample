The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Agenda item 113 (continued)
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations (A/59/668/Add.11)
The President (spoke in French): Before turning to the item on our agenda, I would like to invite the attention of the General Assembly to document A/59/668/Add.11, in which the Secretary-General informs the President of the General Assembly that, since the issuance of his communications contained in documents A/59/668 and Addenda 1 to 10, Dominica has made the payments necessary to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.
May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note of the information contained in this document?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 17 (continued)
Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments
(h) Appointment of members of the Joint Inspection Unit
Note by the President of the General Assembly (A/59/788)
The President (spoke in French): As indicated in document A/59/788, as a result of the resignation of Mr. Christopher Thomas of Trinidad and Tobago, the General Assembly is required, at its fifty-ninth session, to appoint a person to serve as a member of the Joint Inspection Unit for a period expiring on 31 December 2008.
In accordance with the procedures described in article 3, paragraph 1, of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, and having consulted the regional group concerned, I requested Peru to propose a candidate to replace Mr. Thomas.
The candidate, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 59/267 of 23 December 2004, should have experience in at least one of the following fields — oversight, audit, inspection, investigation, evaluation, finance, project evaluation, programme evaluation, human resources management, management, public administration, monitoring and/or programme performance — as well as knowledge of the United Nations system and of its role in international relations.
As also indicated in document A/59/788, as a result of the consultations held in accordance with article 3, paragraph 2, of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, including consultations with the President of the Economic and Social Council and with the Secretary-General in his capacity as Chairman of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, I submit to the Assembly the candidature of Mr. Juan Luis Larrabure of Peru for appointment as a member of the Joint Inspection Unit for a period beginning immediately and expiring on 31 December 2008.
May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to appoint that candidate?
It was so decided.
The President (spoke in French): The General Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 17.
