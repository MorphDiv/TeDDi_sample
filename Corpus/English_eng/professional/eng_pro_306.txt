Annex to the letter dated 7 June 2005 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly
The Embassy of the United Kingdom presents its compliments to the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship, and has the honour to acknowledge their note of 6 May 2005.
Her Majesty's Government firmly rejects this protest.
The inclusion of the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the British Antarctic Territory in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe simply confirms the present position with regard to the status of these British Overseas Territories.
These Territories have been included in the Treaty establishing the European Community since the accession of the United Kingdom on 1 January 1973.
The United Kingdom has no doubts about its sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, the British Antarctic Territory and their surrounding or adjacent maritime areas.
The Embassy of the United Kingdom takes the opportunity to renew to the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs the assurance of its highest consideration.
2 June 2005
