Addendum
Contents
Introduction
By its resolution 58/271 of 23 December 2003, the General Assembly appropriated under section 3, Political affairs, of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 an amount of $169,431,700 for special political missions.
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other political initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and/or the Security Council (A/59/534/Add.1), as well as the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/59/569/Add.1), the Assembly, in its resolutions 59/58 of 3 December 2004 and 59/277 of 23 December 2004, appropriated additional amounts totalling $179,621,600 for special political missions under section 3 of the programme budget for 2004-2005, bringing the total appropriation for special political missions to $349,053,300.
The amount of resources appropriated by the Assembly for special political missions did not include the full resource requirements for 2004-2005 for: (a) the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), for which funding was provided only for the first four months of 2005, and (b) the United Nations Observer Mission in Bougainville (UNOMB), for which funding was provided for liquidation activities only.
The purpose of the present report is to seek additional funding for those two special political missions in 2005 on the basis of Security Council resolution 1557 (2004) with regard to UNAMI and on the basis of the letter dated 23 December 2004 from the President of the Security Council addressed to the Secretary-General (S/2004/1016) with regard to UNOMB.
The current mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq ends on 11 August 2005, and it is anticipated that it will be extended again.
The mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Bougainville was extended for six months, to 30 June 2005.
Table 1 below indicates the resources appropriated for UNAMI and UNOMB for the biennium 2004-2005, estimated expenditures against the appropriations and the additional requirements, along with their mandates and expiry dates.
A summary of requirements by major component is presented in table 2.

United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq
($87,793,500)
Background, mandate and objective
In its resolution 1483 (2003) of 22 May 2003, the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative for Iraq, whose responsibilities would involve reporting regularly to the Council on his activities carried out pursuant to the resolution.
Subsequently, in its resolution 1500 (2003) of 14 August 2003, the Council established the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq for an initial period of 12 months to support the Secretary-General in the fulfilment of his mandate under resolution 1483 (2003) in accordance with the structure and responsibilities set out in his report of 17 July 2003 (S/2003/715).
Under the terms of resolution 1483 (2003), the Mission is mandated by the Security Council, inter alia, to carry out the following activities:
(a) To coordinate activities of the United Nations in post-conflict processes in Iraq, to coordinate among United Nations and international agencies engaged in humanitarian assistance and reconstruction activities in Iraq and to assist the people of Iraq by:
(i) Coordinating humanitarian and reconstruction assistance of United Nations agencies and between those agencies and non-governmental organizations;
(ii) Promoting the safe, orderly and voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons to their homes;
(iii) Facilitating the reconstruction of key infrastructure, in cooperation with other international organizations;
(iv) Promoting economic reconstruction and the conditions for sustainable development, including through coordination with national and regional organizations, as appropriate, civil society, donors and the international financial institutions;
(v) Encouraging international efforts to contribute to basic civilian administration functions;
(vi) Promoting the protection of human rights;
(vii) Encouraging international efforts to rebuild the capacity of the Iraqi civilian police force;
(viii) Encouraging international efforts to promote legal and judicial reform;
(b) To report regularly to the Council on its activities carried out pursuant to resolution 1483 (2003).
In its resolution 1546 (2004) of 8 June 2004, the Security Council affirmed that the United Nations should play a leading role in assisting the Iraqi people and Government in the formation of institutions for representative government.
In addition, the Council decided that in implementing, as circumstances permitted, their mandate to assist the Iraqi people and Government, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and UNAMI, as requested by the Government of Iraq, should:
(a) Play a leading role:
(i) To assist in the convening, during July 2004, of a national conference to select a consultative council;
(ii) To advise and support the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, as well as the Interim Government of Iraq and the Transitional National Assembly, on the process for holding elections;
(iii) To promote national dialogue and consensus-building on the drafting of a national constitution by the people of Iraq;
(b) And also:
(i) To advise the Government of Iraq on the development of effective civil and social services;
(ii) To contribute to the coordination and delivery of reconstruction, development and humanitarian assistance;
(iii) To promote the protection of human rights, national reconciliation and judicial and legal reform in order to strengthen the rule of law in Iraq;
(iv) To advise and assist the Government of Iraq on initial planning for the eventual conduct of a comprehensive census.
In his letter to the President of the Security Council dated 21 September 2004 (S/2004/764), the Secretary-General indicated that in order for the Mission to be able to expand its staffing and its activities in Iraq, it would be necessary, in addition to the protection provided by the multinational force, to establish an integrated United Nations security structure to carry out access control and patrols within mission facilities, to provide personal security details for personnel both within United Nations premises and on the move, to conduct training and to coordinate security arrangements between UNAMI and other United Nations organizations, as well as with the multinational force under unified command as authorized by the Council in its resolutions 1511 (2003) and 1546 (2004).
The integrated security structure of UNAMI would consist of four elements, namely, international security staff, protection coordination officers, personal security details and guard units and would be in addition to the protection provided by the multinational force.
The deployment of those four elements would be subject to ongoing assessments of the overall security situation in Iraq and the related deployment of substantive staff.
Deployment would also depend on the completion of the necessary logistical arrangements, including secure office and living accommodations.
Furthermore, the Secretary-General advised the Security Council that, with regard to the fourth element of the integrated security structure, namely, the guard units, there would eventually be a need for three formed units, each consisting of up to 160 armed civilian police, paramilitary or military personnel to be provided as contingents from Member States.
The guard units would form part of UNAMI and would have the specific responsibility of controlling access to and conducting patrols within UNAMI premises and proposing security arrangements for UNAMI.
The Security Council welcomed the proposed arrangements set out in the letter of the Secretary-General and urged Member States to respond positively with contributions (S/2004/765).
The mandate of UNAMI, under Security Council resolution 1557 (2004), expires on 11 August 2005.
Political activities
In implementing the UNAMI mandate, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and his political team focused their efforts on promoting a better understanding between the political players who had chosen to participate in the political process as well as those who had remained outside.
In response to many appeals for United Nations assistance in supporting the political and electoral processes, from both Iraqi political leaders and Member States, the Special Representative met with Iraqi religious, tribal and political figures not only in Iraq, but also in Dubai, Amman, Beirut, Damascus and London.
The discussions provided access to the perspectives of a variety of political groups in Iraq with regard to participation in the political process.
The Special Representative encouraged all concerned to ensure that the Transitional Government and National Assembly provided mechanisms to ensure that those who had not participated in the elections were adequately represented in the constitution-making process that would follow.
The 30 January elections were an important milestone in the long and difficult process of political transition.
The United Nations played an important role, pursuant to its mandate as set out in Security Council resolution 1546 (2004), in advising and supporting the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq on the process of holding elections.
Under the overall responsibility of the Special Representative, the United Nations electoral assistance team worked effectively with the members of the Independent Electoral Commission to ensure that all the necessary preparations were put into place within a very tight time frame.
In the context of the seventh meeting of foreign ministers of the neighbouring countries of Iraq, held in Amman on 5 and 6 January 2005, the follow-up meeting to the Sharm el-Sheikh international meeting, held in Cairo on 11 January 2005, and visits to Beirut and Damascus, the Special Representative and his political team were able to review the prospects for the elections and their wider ramifications with senior government officials and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States.
The Special Representative stressed the need to encourage Iraqi political actors to engage directly with each other to enable them to discern the political aspirations and objectives they shared, which could provide a basis for compromise and reconciliation.
In turn, all the regional interlocutors acknowledged the leading role of the United Nations and encouraged its efforts to facilitate political dialogue in Iraq.
Electoral activities
On 30 January 2005, three simultaneous elections were held in Iraq, those for the Transitional National Assembly, for 18 governorate councils and for the Kurdistan National Assembly.
The elections met recognized international standards in terms of organization, regulations and procedures.
The assessments by Iraqi and international observers indicated overall satisfaction with the conduct of the polls.
An open process of complaint and resolution was formulated and implemented by the Independent Electoral Commission, supported by both Iraqi lawyers and international specialists.
The Commission officially certified the vote on 17 February 2005 after all major complaints had been dealt with; those outstanding complaints which would be decided after certification were assessed to be of such a nature that they could not affect the result.
The electoral assistance team, which, in addition to United Nations experts, included experts from the European Union, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Chile and the International Foundation for Election Systems, provided technical, logistical, financial and administrative assistance to the Independent Electoral Commission in a number of key areas.
Key tasks in support of the electoral process included developing the regulatory framework for the elections and all operational and administrative procedures; building the institutional framework of the Commission and consolidating its establishment and presence throughout the country; establishing the voter registry; developing the Commission's information technology system; developing and producing all electoral materials; training Commission officials and personnel; supporting public outreach efforts, including public information and civic/voter education; providing training to national observation groups; supporting the process for accreditation of electoral observers; coordinating logistical support and donor contributions; and coordinating international technical assistance delivered to the Commission.
During 2005, pending a formal request by Iraq, United Nations electoral support may encompass the following tasks: (a) consultation between the United Nations and the elected representatives of the Transitional National Assembly with a view to providing assistance in the formulation of an electoral framework and promoting agreement on an electoral system and regulations as part of the constitutional process; (b) technical assistance to strengthen the Commission's capabilities, including personnel, institutional and administrative capacities, for the preparation of a constitutional referendum and elections; and (c) a continued leading role in the coordination of international electoral assistance, including technical, administrative, logistical and financial support for the organization of a constitutional referendum and elections in December.
Constitutional support
The Security Council, in its resolution 1546 (2004), decided that the United Nations should take a leading role to promote national dialogue and consensus-building on the drafting of a national constitution by the people of Iraq when so requested by the Government of Iraq.
According to the Transitional Administrative Law, the Transitional National Assembly has to prepare a draft of a permanent constitution by no later than 15 August 2005 (with a possible one-time extension of six months), which would then be put to a referendum by no later than 15 October 2005 (or 15 April 2006).
Pending a formal request by Iraq, UNAMI, in cooperation with concerned offices at Headquarters and with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has been preparing for an envisioned fourfold role in support of the constitution-making process: (a) political facilitation — promoting dialogue among key constituencies on the procedures and structure of the constitution-making process to foster inclusiveness, public participation and transparency and promoting consensus on key constitutional issues that may prove controversial; (b) public information support for a wide-ranging Iraqi media campaign to maximize transparency; (c) provision of technical assistance to the Iraqi constitution-drafting body; and (d) coordination of international assistance.
Reconstruction and humanitarian activities
United Nations agencies and programmes continue to support the process of rebuilding Iraq both inside and outside the country.
Staffan de Mistura was appointed Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Reconstruction and Development.
A deputy humanitarian/reconstruction coordinator was deployed to Baghdad to enhance communication with the Iraqi authorities on reconstruction and development issues and to enhance donor coordination.
The United Nations country team has engaged in a broad range of capacity-building activities, programmes and projects in collaboration with line ministries.
From December 2004 to March 2005, the United Nations country team will have carried out approximately 100 capacity-building activities in the form of technical training, workshops, seminars, conferences and high-level meetings, actively involving participants from all ministries and many civil society organizations.
Despite the continuing fragile security environment, the United Nations was able to continue its reconstruction efforts throughout Iraq.
Those activities include: rehabilitation of schools; strengthening of vocational education; rehabilitation of water treatment plants; rehabilitation of power plants and upgrading of transmission systems; construction of housing projects for selected vulnerable groups in urban centres; provision of support for the Ministry of Trade's public distribution system and procurement and delivery of food items; provision of technical assistance to the National Mine Action Authority; protection of and provision of material assistance to internally displaced persons and returning Iraqi refugees; provision of support to civil society through professional organizations and women's groups and provision of support to the electoral process, including women's voter education programmes.
Human rights
The UNAMI Human Rights Office continues to monitor the human rights situation in the country and to work with Iraqi institutions and civil society to address the legacy of the past as well as present challenges in a spirit of fostering national reconciliation.
Its interventions are based on the human rights programme developed in 2004 jointly with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), other United Nations agencies, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Human Rights, as well as with the Ministries of Displacement and Migration, Women's Affairs, Civil Society and Interior.
The UNAMI Human Rights Office is assisting in the establishment of a national centre for missing and disappeared persons, as requested by the Minister of Human Rights.
The Office has also engaged with the Minister of Justice to implement projects addressing the reform of the Ministry, as well as the legal, judiciary and penitentiary systems.
Regarding Iraqi civil society organizations, the Human Rights Office, together with OHCHR and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), is implementing a country-wide programme including conferences, seminars, training, research and publications.
Following a conference on the role of civil society organized in December 2004 by UNOPS in cooperation with UNAMI, a three-phase training-of-trainers programme on human rights was begun on 10 February 2005.
Training on project management took place from 20 to 24 February 2005.
Public information
The UNAMI Public Information Office has continued its concerted efforts to publicize and raise awareness of the Mission's political, humanitarian and reconstruction work in Iraq through targeted outreach to the Iraqi people, media, donors and other stakeholders.
It has provided briefings, press releases, media advisories, official statements and interviews in addition to promoting conferences, training workshops for the Iraqi people and seminars organized by various components of the Mission.
The Public Information Office is promoting the next donors' meeting, to be held in Amman in April or May 2005.
In addition, the Office is in the process of redesigning the Mission's web site to make it more user-friendly, achieve language parity and provide more core documents.
Basra and Erbil deployments
A five-member United Nations liaison detachment team was deployed to Basra on 12 February 2005.
Hardened accommodation has been provided by the multinational force for a six-person team, together with office accommodation and full “life-support” facilities at the Basra Palace.
This is intended to be a temporary accommodation pending the construction of a longer term facility at another building on the Basra Palace island.
As concerns the Al-Maquil port facility, while it is complete, it will be used only when security conditions permit.
A United Nations liaison detachment was deployed to Erbil in February 2005.
It had a four-member team by 16 February 2005 and, as in the case of Basra, the multinational force has provided containers for accommodation and office space.
The liaison detachment will oversee the completion of the United Nations compound adjacent to the airfield.
Objective, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement
The objective, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement of the Mission are presented below.
External factors
The objective is expected to be achieved provided that circumstances are favourable for the United Nations to carry out its role as mandated by the Security Council, the security situation in Iraq does not negatively affect the political transition process and there is continuing political will.
Resource requirements
The estimated requirements of UNAMI for the eight-month period from 1 May to 31 December 2005 amount to $87,793,500 net ($91,871,700 gross).
Of that amount, $5,320,900 would be met from the unencumbered balance of the amount already appropriated for UNAMI.
Thus, the overall requirements of UNAMI for the eight-month period from 1 May to 31 December 2005, after taking into account the unencumbered balance, would amount to $82,472,600 net ($86,550,800 gross).
The requested amount of $87,793,500 net ($91,871,700 gross) would provide for: (a) the cost of deployment to Baghdad, Basra and Erbil of three guard units comprising 334 personnel ($20,479,600), including logistics/life support provided to those troops by the multinational force; (b) salaries and common staff costs, applicable mission subsistence and hazard allowances and logistical capability support for 344 international staff positions in Iraq, assuming a 10 per cent vacancy rate ($37,241,800); (c) salaries and common staff costs, hazard pay and overtime for 472 national staff positions, taking into account a 5 per cent vacancy factor ($6,445,500); (d) services of experts and consultants ($845,100); (e) official travel ($556,900); (f) facilities and infrastructure ($6,818,500); (g) ground transportation ($566,500); (h) air transportation ($6,457,300); (i) communications ($3,931,400); (j) information technology ($1,113,700); and (k) other operational costs ($3,337,200).
United Nations Observer Mission in Bougainville
($648,400)
Background, mandate and objective
The United Nations Observer Mission in Bougainville was established in 2003, initially for six months, as a follow-up mission to the United Nations Political Office in Bougainville.
The establishment of the Mission was requested by the Secretary-General in a letter to the Security Council dated 19 December 2003 (S/2003/1198) in the light of the progress achieved in the peace process in Bougainville and in accordance with the request of the Government of Papua New Guinea, which was also supported by the Bougainville parties.
The Mission was mandated to carry out the following functions:
(a) To chair the Peace Process Consultative Committee, which would consult with the parties on the peace process and make preparation for elections;
(b) To report on the security and subsequent destruction of the contained weapons;
(c) To monitor the constitutional process leading to the adoption of the Bougainville Constitution;
(d) In accordance with the amended Constitution of Papua New Guinea, and if requested by any of the parties, to verify and certify substantial compliance by the parties in the handing in of weapons and whether the level of security was conducive to the holding of elections;
(e) Perform other good offices as appropriate or when requested to do so by the parties.
On the basis of the exchange of letters between the Secretary-General and the Security Council (S/2004/526 dated 25 June 2004 and S/2004/527 dated 30 June 2004), the mandate of UNOMB was extended until December 2004.
Subsequently, in his report to the Security Council of 29 September 2004 (S/2004/771), the Secretary-General reported on the progress achieved by the parties to the Bougainville Peace Agreement, the development of a constitution for an autonomous Bougainville government, preparations for elections and the plan for the closing of the Mission.
In anticipation that the Mission would end by 31 December 2004 and enter its liquidation phase immediately thereafter, no resources were requested for the continued operation of UNOMB except for liquidation activities.
By his letter of 21 December 2004 (S/2004/1015), the Secretary-General brought to the attention of the President of the Security Council a letter addressed to him by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration of Papua New Guinea and informed the Council that UNOMB held the chairmanship of the Peace Process Consultative Committee and monitored and reported to the Consultative Committee on the security situation, a role that was especially crucial in the period leading up to the elections.
He also indicated that the renewed activities of Francis Ona across Bougainville made it imperative that UNOMB continue to facilitate a dialogue between his supporters and the Bougainville leaders until the voting was completed and that every effort should be made to sustain the progress achieved thus far to enable the parties to reach a successful conclusion of the peace process in June 2005.
In his reply dated 23 December 2004 (S/2004/1016), the President of the Security Council informed the Secretary-General that the Council had taken note of the recommendation of the Secretary-General and requested him to submit a report within three months providing an assessment of the situation on the ground and a mission closure plan.
The Secretary-General will be submitting the requested report.
Objective, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement
The objective, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement of the Mission are presented below.
External factors
The objective is expected to be achieved provided that the situation on the ground is conducive to weapons disposal and elections and the Government of Papua New Guinea and other parties fully participate in the implementation of the peace process.
Resource requirements
The resource requirements for UNOMB for the period from 1 January to 15 August 2005, including the liquidation period of one and a half months, are estimated at $648,400 net ($701,400 gross).
The amount appropriated by the General Assembly in its resolution 59/277 for the envisaged liquidation phase amounted to $180,300.
However, as the mandate of UNOMB was subsequently extended, estimated expenditures exceed the appropriation by $53,400.
Thus, the overall requirements for UNOMB for the period up to 15 August 2005, after the estimated expenditure to date is taken into account, amount to $701,800 net ($754,800 gross).
This amount would provide for the continuation of the four international positions (one P-5 head of mission, one P-4 political affairs officer, one Field Service administrative officer and one Field Service communications officer) and four Local level positions ($306,200); official travel of the head of mission and his staff ($55,600); and operational requirements, including premises/accommodation, air operations, communications and supplies and services ($286,600).
Estimated resource requirements for special political missions emanating from the decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council
The total requirements for the activities described in the present report are estimated at $88,441,900 net ($92,573,100 gross).
Of that amount, $5,320,900 would be met from the unencumbered balance against the existing appropriation.
Mission-by-mission budget estimates are set out in table 1 above.
Action required of the General Assembly
The General Assembly is requested to:
(a) Approve the budgets for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the United Nations Observer Mission in Bougainville as shown in table 1 above;
(b) Note that the charging of expenditures against the appropriation for UNAMI beyond 11 August 2005 would be subject to the extension of its current mandate;
(c) Note that the requirements arising under the regular budget in connection with the extension of UNAMI and UNOMB are estimated at $83,174,400 net ($87,305,600 gross), taking into account the unencumbered balance amounting to $5,320,900 of the existing appropriation;
(d) Appropriate $83,174,400 under section 3, Political affairs, and $4,131,200 under section 34, Staff assessment, to be offset by a corresponding amount under income section 1, Income from staff assessment, of the programme budget for 2004-2005.
