Preface
The General Assembly, in its resolution 58/269 of 23 December 2003 on strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change, requested the Secretary-General to prepare, on a trial basis, for submission to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, a strategic framework to replace the four-year medium-term plan, which would comprise in one document:
(a) Part one: a plan outline, reflecting the longer-term objectives of the Organization;
(b) Part two: a biennial programme plan, to cover two years.
The General Assembly also affirmed in that resolution that the strategic framework should constitute the principal policy directive of the United Nations and should serve as the basis for programme planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation; decided to review, with a view to taking a final decision at its sixty-second session, the format, content and duration of the strategic framework, including the necessity of maintaining part one, and requested the Secretary-General to submit a report, through the Committee for Programme and Coordination, reviewing the experiences gained with the changes made in the planning and budgeting process.
The Assembly also decided that the programme narratives of the programme budget fascicles should be identical to the biennial programme plan.
The Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, through the Committee for Programme and Coordination at its forty-fourth session, the proposed plan outline and biennial programme plan of the strategic framework for the period 2006-2007.
For its deliberations the Committee for Programme and Coordination also had before it conference room paper prepared by the Secretariat on the review of part two: biennial programme plan by the relevant sectoral, functional and regional bodies.
The General Assembly, in its resolution 59/275 of 23 December 2004 on programme planning, having considered the report of the Committee for Programme and Coordination,1 endorsed the conclusions and recommendations contained therein with respect to the biennial programme plan for the period 2006-2007, those of the First Committee concerning programme 3, Disarmament (A/C.5/59/17), those of the Second Committee concerning programme 10, Trade and development (A/C.5/59/15), those concerning programme 19, Human rights (A/C.5/59/26), and those of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) concerning programme 23, Public information (A/C.5/59/14).
The Assembly decided to take no decision on the content of part one: plan outline.
In the same resolution, the General Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to issue in one document, before the forty-fifth session of the Committee for Programme and Coordination, only the priorities and the biennial programme plan as adopted.
The content of the present document reflects that request.

Programme 3 Disarmament
Overall orientation
3.1 General and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control remains the ultimate goal of all efforts exerted in the field of disarmament.
The main responsibilities for disarmament lie with Member States.
The United Nations, in accordance with its Charter, has a central role and primary responsibility in supporting Member States in this area.
3.2 The mandate for the programme derives from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions in the field of disarmament, including the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, the first special session devoted to disarmament (resolution S-10/2).
The programme is also guided by the United Nations Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/5) and takes into account other relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
Weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, continue to be of primary concern to the Organization.
Conventional disarmament, especially with regard to major weapons systems, small arms and light weapons and landmines, has received growing attention from the international community over the last few years.
3.3 Within the Secretariat, substantive responsibility for the programme is vested in the Department for Disarmament Affairs.
The Department's strategy for implementing the programme is based on its role and responsibility for facilitating and encouraging, as appropriate, disarmament measures at all levels.
The Department will continue to assist Member States in promoting, strengthening and consolidating multilaterally negotiated principles and norms in all areas of disarmament.
Support will be given to efforts of Member States in the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation in order to help maintain international peace and security and to contribute to global efforts against terrorism.
The Department will enhance its efforts aimed at promoting and facilitating the implementation of the Programme of Action adopted at the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, as well as practical disarmament measures.
It will promote transparency, based on the principle of undiminished security for all, and confidence-building measures in the field of disarmament.
It will continue to be a source of impartial and factual information on disarmament and security-related matters for Member States, organizations of the United Nations system, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations and will expand its educational outreach programmes.
Through its regional centres for peace and disarmament, the Department will assist Member States in promoting regional approaches to disarmament and security.
It will also continue to contribute to efforts to enhance disarmament expertise in Member States, particularly in developing countries.
3.4 The Department will seek to achieve the objectives of the programme by facilitating the process of multilateral deliberation and negotiation.
This will include providing substantive organizational support to the First Committee, the Disarmament Commission and other subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly, the Conference on Disarmament and its subsidiary bodies, review conferences and other meetings of parties to multilateral disarmament agreements, as well as to expert groups mandated by the General Assembly.
This will also include monitoring and assessing current and future trends in the field of disarmament and international security.

Programme 4
Peacekeeping operations
Peacekeeping operations
Overall orientation
4.1 The purpose of the programme is to support the maintenance of peace and security through the deployment of peacekeeping operations in accordance with and by authority derived from the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.
The mandates of the programme are provided in resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.
4.2 The programme closely coordinates five interdependent and complementary subprogrammes (Operations, Mission support, Military, Civilian police and Mine action coordination) and integrates cross-cutting responsibilities.
Programme strategies are based on the development of capacities to address a wide variety of conflict situations and the need to plan, establish, manage and direct peacekeeping operations.
A rapid and effective response to Security Council and General Assembly mandates is crucial for supporting the implementation of peace agreements between the parties to a conflict.
Peacekeeping mandates may include the monitoring of ceasefires and buffer zones; disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating ex-combatants; reforming military establishments; training, advising, and monitoring police forces; creating security conditions conducive to the return of refugees and internally displaced populations; promoting electoral and judicial reform and assisting civil administrations; facilitating political processes to consolidate peace and legitimate government authority; coordinating economic rehabilitation and mine-clearance programmes; and facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
Missions may also be mandated to maintain law and order and assume responsibility for a transitional administration or executive law enforcement, including criminal justice functions.
The programme serves as the lead department in the implementation of integrated mandates, including multisectoral assistance operations, and provides logistical and administrative support, in addition to demining coordination.
Regional approaches to peacekeeping, in terms of peacekeeping capacity, political strategies and common support to multiple operations, will be pursued when appropriate.
4.3 The programme will inform Member States on all phases of peacekeeping operations, paying particular attention to the requirements of troop and police contributors, which need to make informed decisions on their participation in peacekeeping missions.
Special attention will be given to the safety and security of peacekeepers in the field.
Careful consideration will also be given to gender and geographical balance in the staffing of peacekeeping operations.
4.4 Meeting the complex and evolving challenges of modern peacekeeping requires an integrated approach and greater coordination within the United Nations system and with external peacekeeping partners, including international financial institutions and regional organizations, to enhance the ability of the international community to maintain peace and security.
To increase the programme's effectiveness, the research, analysis, review and application of peacekeeping best practices and lessons learned will continue, as will continued emphasis on proper conduct and tailored training for all peacekeeping personnel.
In addition, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations will continue its gender mainstreaming strategy, aimed at providing better policies and programmes that take fully into account the impact of peacekeeping operations on women, men, girls and boys.
This will entail the incorporation of gender perspectives in all peacekeeping activities, from the initial planning stages to the liquidation of a mission, as well as ensuring adequate gender expertise at Headquarters and in the field.
4.5 The programme will provide substantive and technical support to the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, including follow-up on decisions related to peacekeeping operations taken by the Security Council and the General Assembly.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations will implement the recommendations of the Special Committee, as endorsed by the General Assembly.
Subprogramme 1 Operations
Strategy
4.6 The Office of Operations will continue to perform its core functions of providing timely advice and analysis to the Security Council, the General Assembly, intergovernmental bodies and troop-contributing and other contributing countries on peacekeeping issues and on the integrated planning, effective direction of and support for peacekeeping operations through, inter alia, the provision of policy and operational guidance, security management and gender mainstreaming.
4.7 The United Nations faces increased challenges in planning for and effectively implementing the complex mandates that are often called for in peacekeeping operations today and in meeting the planning demands of surges in operational activity.
The Office of Operations will seek to coordinate a fully integrated mission-planning process across all stakeholders within the United Nations system, producing a mission concept of operations and component plans that are fully understood, integrated and owned, both at Headquarters and in the field.
Best practices and lessons learned will be incorporated into the design, planning and implementation of new and existing missions.
The safety and security of personnel working in peacekeeping operations will be accorded the highest priority, and to that end appropriate attention, both at Headquarters and in the field, will be given to information management, security assessment and risk and threat analysis.
In addition, the Office of Operations will seek to promote regional peacekeeping capacity and organizational relationships and focus on partnerships to address cross-cutting issues.
Subprogramme 2 Mission support
Strategy
4.8 Within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the substantive responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Office of Mission Support.
The activities of the Office include ongoing support to peacekeeping and other operations in the areas of personnel, finance, logistics and communications.
The subprogramme will enable missions to sustain themselves effectively and efficiently for the fulfilment of their mandates, respond to changing circumstances on the ground or changes in mandate and provide assistance and services when missions are unable to do so themselves.
The subprogramme will continually monitor and provide policy guidance and oversight to the delivery of mission support.
The subprogramme will also work towards the effective management of field missions.
To that end, the subprogramme will enhance resource planning and improve project management techniques and processes, including the development of a repertoire of replicable support models for a variety of strategic conditions in launching, sustaining and liquidating missions.
The subprogramme will also work towards ensuring operational readiness and will prioritize the timely deployment of financial, personnel and material resources, as well as enhance its capacity rapidly to deploy a fully effective mission to areas of operation.
It will strengthen and support the operational capacities of the Department by managing and coordinating training and career development for civilian staff in field missions.
Concerted efforts will be made to improve gender balance and geographical distribution in the staffing of field missions.
Subprogramme 3 Military
Strategy
4.9 Within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the substantive responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Military Division.
To meet the objectives, operational plans must be in place for the military components of potential and current peacekeeping operations, as must be appropriately trained and rapidly deployable personnel and other military resources.
The activities of the subprogramme will include: the preparation of operational plans for military components of peacekeeping operations, such as contingency plans for potential, ongoing or closing operations; the generation of military forces, observers and Headquarters staff for deployment, including pre-deployment assessments, coordination of deployments and rotations of the military components of missions; daily monitoring of and support to the military components of peacekeeping operations; and the conduct and coordination of peacekeeping training activities for deploying uniformed personnel of Member States.
Consideration to relevant gender dimensions will be given in undertaking these activities.
4.10 The subprogramme will provide military advice to peacekeeping partners within and outside the programme and will develop closer linkages with regional organizations, including the African Union, the European Union, the Economic Community of West African States, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and others, on all military peacekeeping issues.
The subprogramme will produce policies and papers on the employment of military capability in support of peacekeeping objectives and will liaise closely with peacekeeping partners to standardize approaches.
To enhance the Organization's capacity to respond to conflicts, effective rapid deployment mechanisms and the immediate availability of military contingents and personnel to deploy to new operations is essential.
A review of the United Nations standby arrangements mechanisms will therefore be ongoing.
Subprogramme 4 Civilian police
Strategy
4.11 Within the Department, the substantive responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Civilian Police Division.
In a post-conflict society the re-establishment of the rule of law and strengthening of the national internal security apparatus and institutions are paramount for the creation of an environment for lasting peace.
In this regard, the Division develops, together with the Department's judicial and corrections experts, comprehensive police plans for peacekeeping operations that consider the judicial and correctional systems in place; the interrelation between the police, judiciary and corrections institutions; the nature of criminal procedures and laws in effect; and the relevant gender dimensions.
With other relevant parts of the Department, the Division engages in partnerships, particularly with the United Nations Development Programme and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, for the development of national policing institutions and judicial and correctional systems.
Through the standardization of mission oversight, the provision of strategic advice and guidance and the engagement of partners at Headquarters, the Civilian Police Division assists missions with the implementation of mandates that range from monitoring, training, mentoring, assisting and advising local police, as well as performing executive policing functions, when mandated.
4.12 Through the active engagement of Member States, the Division will continue to refine the recruitment process and to ensure that police officers with the required skills, including female officers, are recruited according to the needs of each mission.
The Division will also ensure that police-contributing countries are provided with comprehensive training programmes for delivery at national police training institutions, as well as pre-deployment training materials.
The Division will consider how to further enhance efficient planning and early implementation of mandates.
4.13 The Civilian Police Division will act as a repository for civilian police peacekeeping issues.
To enhance the development of institutional memory and expertise and the dissemination of lessons learned and best practices, the Division will actively engage regional and subregional organizations on all aspects of policing issues.
It will also strengthen its engagement with Member States and regional peacekeeping training centres on current training practices, policing standards, training policy and material.
In addition, the Division will continue to develop partnerships with police services, police colleges, research and academic institutions, police associations and others.
Subprogramme 5 Mine action coordination
Strategy
4.14 The substantive responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the United Nations Mine Action Service, which is the coordinating body in the United Nations for mine action.
The Service will work with other United Nations and non-governmental organization partners to assist affected nations to develop local mine action capacity; develop and manage mine action programmes in support of peacekeeping missions or in humanitarian emergencies, when appropriate; develop policies and promulgate lessons learned in the areas of mine clearance, mine risk education, victim assistance, advocacy and stockpile destruction; and coordinate the mobilization and administration of resources for mine action.
It will also undertake assessment missions and surveys to establish priorities.
The Mine Action Service will continue to oversee the development and implementation of internationally agreed standards that will provide a framework for efficient, effective and safer mine action activities and provide guidance and coordination for the development of new mine action technologies.
It will produce, gather and disseminate information to aid mine action and to raise awareness of mine related issues.
Moreover, it will coordinate the implementation of the United Nations mine action advocacy strategy so as to strengthen the normative framework for the mine and explosive remnants of war problem, as well as the rights of survivors of mines and explosive remnants of war; to promote the integration of mine action throughout the work of the United Nations system; and to promote compliance by non-State actors with obligations and commitments on matters related to mines, explosive remnants of war and survivors' rights.
Consideration will be given to relevant gender dimensions in undertaking these activities.
Peacekeeping missions
United Nations Truce Supervision Organization
Strategy
4.15 The United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) will continue to provide trained military observers under the operational support command of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, assisting with the implementation of their respective mandates.
It will continue its core functions of maintaining a minimum acceptable level of patrols, notwithstanding deterioration in the regional security situation.
Moreover, it will continue mobile patrolling and will increase the number of observation patrols to ensure a greater presence in the areas of separation and Blue Line to deter all parties from any violation of the agreements.
4.16 The mission will continue to provide timely and accurate observation reports and analysis of political developments mission-wide, including safety and security situation.
It will also continue to exercise command, administrative, logistical and security support to all outstations mission-wide.
In addition, it will continue to use the good offices of the Head of Missions to strengthen and improve the relationships between Israel and its neighbouring countries.
Moreover, the mission will continue to maintain and improve effective liaison with troop-contributing nations' ambassadorial and consular representatives, as well as regional United Nations organizations.
Furthermore, it will continue to develop contingency planning to address changes in the military and/or political situation in the UNTSO area of operation.
United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan
Strategy
4.17 The United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan will continue to provide timely and detailed routine as well as ad hoc reports on relevant developments in the UNMOGIP area of operations, in accordance with the implementation of its mandate.
4.18 UNMOGIP will continue to maintain military observers at all its operational field stations on both sides of the line of control, will conduct efficient patrols and effective inspections and investigations of the alleged violations of the line of control and, to the extent permitted by the host countries, perform field tasks in the vicinity of the line of control from the field stations.
The number of United Nations military observers may be adjusted among Headquarters and field stations in accordance with operational requirements.

Programme 5
Peaceful uses of outer space
Overall orientation
5.1 The overall purpose of the programme is the promotion of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space for economic, social and scientific development.
The need for international cooperation in space activities and the importance of using outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes were first recognized by the General Assembly in its resolution 1348 (XIII) of 13 December 1958.
By its resolution 1472 A (XIV) of 12 December 1959, the General Assembly established the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
The direction of the programme is provided in resolutions of the General Assembly and decisions of the Committee, its Legal Subcommittee and Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and their subsidiary bodies.
Recommendations of particular relevance for the work to be undertaken under this programme are contained in the resolution entitled “The Space Millennium: Vienna Declaration on Space and Human Development”, adopted by the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III) and endorsed by the Assembly in its resolution 54/68 of 6 December 1999.
5.2 In the Vienna Declaration, the importance of space science and technology and their applications to the enhancement of environmental monitoring, the management of natural resources, disaster management, weather and climate forecasting, health, fundamental knowledge of the universe, education and health, as well as the contributions of global navigation satellite systems to the promotion of sustainable development and of satellite communications to bridging the digital divide was recognized.
Additionally, the Declaration stressed the importance of providing girls and women with opportunities to participate in and benefit from space activities.
Pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 56/51, 57/116 and 58/89, efforts continue to be made to bring the benefits of the use of space technology to the attention of the conferences organized within the United Nations system to address global issues relating to social, economic and cultural development.
Particular emphasis is placed on promoting the use of space science and technology in implementing the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the Plan of Action of the World Summit on the Information Society.
5.3 Through implementation of the programme, strengthened efforts at the international, regional and national levels will also be made to integrate space-based services and systems, in particular into the infrastructure of developing countries, so as to maximize the benefits of space science and technology and their applications for sustained economic and social development and the enhancement of human development and welfare.
These efforts would be achieved through the promotion of universal adherence to international space law and by expanding international cooperation among countries with the involvement of entities of the United Nations system and space-related international entities, including non-governmental organizations and industry, as appropriate.
Strategy

Programme 7
Economic and social affairs
Overall orientation
7.1 The overall orientation of the programme is to support and advance international cooperation in the pursuit of sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development through an integrated approach encompassing economic, social, environmental, gender and population dimensions.
7.2 The programme is guided by the comprehensive policy framework for poverty eradication and development provided by the United Nations conferences of the 1990s, the Millennium Summit, the International Conference on Financing for Development and the World Summit on Sustainable Development, and seeks to promote integration and coordination in the implementation of their outcomes and their follow-up.
While focused on global policy development, the programme's activities are geared to promoting mutual reinforcement between global policies and regional and national policies and actions.
7.3 Thus oriented, the programme undertakes four main types of activity.
Firstly, it compiles a wide range of economic, social and environmental data and information and analyses them with a view to identifying trends and taking stock of policy options.
Secondly, it reviews development issues and policies to deepen the international community's understanding of global challenges in the economic and social spheres and to assist Member States to reach consensus on the most appropriate responses to those challenges.
Thirdly, it advises Member States on the ways and means to translate globally agreed policies into country-level action and, through technical cooperation, helps build national capacities.
Fourthly, it provides a central capacity within the Secretariat to promote policy and programme coherence among the economic and social sectors of the Organization, and to orient and organize cooperation and coordination, between the United Nations and the specialized agencies and within the United Nations system as a whole, in the economic and social area, particularly in support of the central intergovernmental bodies.
7.4 In 2006-2007, the programme will build on the outcomes of the first comprehensive review of the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration and the 2005 event provided for in General Assembly resolution 57/270 B of 23 June 2003, on the results of the renewed attention that the Economic and Social Council is currently giving to the integrated follow-up to conferences and on the conference follow-up reviews in its functional commissions, as well as on the outcomes of the reform initiatives under way during the current biennium at both the intergovernmental and the Secretariat level.
On this basis, the programme proposes to further sharpen its orientation towards implementation and further reinforce its contribution to this end, particularly in relation to accelerating progress in the implementation of internationally agreed development goals and to supporting implementation of the reform measures that will be agreed upon during the current biennium to further this objective.
7.5 This will be done, in the first instance, by strengthening the programme's knowledge-management capacities and its role in the global policy dialogue, particularly by enhancing the quality and relevance of its publications and other analytical products.
The programme will also seek to further strengthen the quality and coherence of its support for the central intergovernmental bodies, particularly relating to the implementation of measures that may be agreed upon by those bodies to enhance their functioning and affect international policy-making and to the treatment of key issues, such as the eradication of poverty and hunger, that cut across the outcomes of the conferences and the disciplines covered by the programme.
Finally, the programme will seek to further reinforce the integration of its normative, analytical and operational activities so that its role in the creation of knowledge and the deepening of Member States' understanding of policy choices and their outcomes in the areas it covers, and its contribution to the generation of norms, standards and legislation, may enhance its support for Member States through operational work.
Such work, and the insights it generates in key areas of the programme's mandate, such as sustainable development, social development, public administration, population, statistics and gender, should become a source of increasing enrichment for its normative and analytical activities.
7.6 In relation to both analytical activities and operational work, multidisciplinary approaches will be strengthened as one of the main components of the programme's comparative advantage in advancing the implementation of conference outcomes.
With regard to technical cooperation, the programme's comparative advantage lies not only in its substantive capacities relating to areas of global concern, but in its capacity to bring to the country level the experience of other regions by means of advisory services, training and electronic technical cooperation.

Programme 8
Least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States
Overall orientation
8.1 The legislative authority for the programme derives from General Assembly resolution 55/279 of 12 July 2001, by which the Assembly endorsed the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 adopted at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Brussels in May 2001, and 56/227 of 24 December 2001 whereby the Assembly decided to establish the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States in accordance with the recommendations of the Secretary-General contained in his report of 23 November 2001 (A/56/645 and Add.1 and Add.1/Corr.1 and 2).
8.2 The mandate of the programme covers four main elements:
(a) Mobilization and coordination of international support for the effective implementation of: (i) the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010; (ii) the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries; and (iii) the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of the Small Island Developing States;
(b) Enhanced monitoring and follow-up to the three Programmes of Action;
(c) Advocacy and promotion of global awareness with respect to the three groups of countries (least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States);
(d) Reporting at the global level on the implementation of the Brussels and Almaty Programmes of Action as effective tools for reaching the international development goals for the concerned countries.
8.3 In this context, the programme will also contribute to the implementation of the relevant and related internationally agreed development goals concerning the three groups of countries, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.
The programme will mobilize international support in favour of its constituencies in the areas of capacity-building and increased technical and financial resources in promoting sustained growth and sustainable development.
Gender is an important dimension in the implementation of the three Programmes of Action.
8.4 The overall programme of work of the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States is designed around three interdependent and complementary subprogrammes, namely, subprogramme 1, Least developed countries, subprogramme 2, Landlocked developing countries, and subprogramme 3, Small island developing States.
8.5 With a view to addressing the objectives in each of the three main areas of endeavour, the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States will use a combination of the following approaches and strategies:
(a) Advocating that the concerns of least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States be placed high on the global agenda in respect of the Brussels, Almaty and Barbados Programmes of Action;
(b) Mobilizing international support and resources in favour of the three groups of countries;
(c) Providing monitoring and follow-up to foster supportive policies in the three groups of countries and their development partners;
(d) Working with the United Nations system and other international organizations, including the regional organizations, the donor community and civil society, to ensure proper mainstreaming of priorities identified in each of the three Programmes of Action;
(e) Monitoring of all seven specific commitments of the Brussels Programme of Action: (i) fostering a people-centred policy framework, (ii) good governance at national and international levels, (iii) building human and institutional capacities, (iv) building capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries, (v) enhancing the role of trade in development, (vi) reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment, and (vii) mobilizing financial resources;
(f) Supporting the effective participation of the least developed countries in intergovernmental processes;
(g) Building partnerships towards the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action by establishing coordinating mechanisms for its implementation at national, subregional and global levels;
(h) Monitoring and coordinating implementation of specific actions and initiatives aimed at establishing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries;
(i) Promoting South-South cooperation in various areas for the benefit of the countries of these three groups;
(j) Reaching out to all stakeholders, including partnerships with civil society and the private sector.

Programme 9
United Nations support for the New Partnership for Africa's Development
Overall orientation
3 NEPAD was formally adopted by the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its thirty-seventh ordinary session, held in Lusaka in July 2001.
9.1 The programme was established following the final review and appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) in 2002.
As a result of that review, the General Assembly adopted its resolution 57/7, which brought to a close UN-NADAF and endorsed the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)3 as the framework for international community support to Africa's development.
In its resolution 57/7 the Assembly also outlined the substantive areas and modalities for providing such support.
More specifically, it underscored the need for a structure in the Secretariat in New York to review and report on support provided by the United Nations system and the international community for the New Partnership and on the coordinated implementation of outcomes of summit meetings and conferences as they relate to Africa, as well as coordinate global advocacy in support of the New Partnership.
In addition, it welcomed the actions being taken at the regional level by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) to organize the activities of the United Nations system around thematic clusters covering the priority areas of the New Partnership and, in this regard, urged the strengthening of this process as a means of enhancing the coordinated response of the United Nations system in support of the New Partnership.
Finally, it called upon the United Nations system to enhance its advocacy role and public information activities in support of Africa's development.
Subsequent to resolution 57/7, in its resolution 57/300, the Assembly endorsed the creation of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa and entrusted to the Special Adviser the role of coordinating reports and advocacy in support of NEPAD.
9.2 It is pertinent to note that there is a commitment in NEPAD to achieving several of the Millennium Development Goals and this represents an important linkage with the United Nations Millennium Declaration.
In addition, NEPAD fully reflects the priorities on meeting the special needs of Africa in the Millennium Declaration, namely: supporting the political and institutional structures of emerging democracies in Africa; building peacekeeping capacity further, in cooperation with regional organizations; taking special measures to address the challenges of poverty reduction and sustainable development by increasing official development assistance, enhancing private capital flows and building capacities for trade; and helping Africa build its capacity to tackle the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.
From the foregoing, it is clear that NEPAD is the framework for achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the aims of the Millennium Declaration in Africa.
Consequently, through its support to NEPAD, this programme will contribute to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals in Africa.
9.3 One of the reasons for the current situation in Africa is the incidence of armed conflict and insecurity in the region.
Although the link between conflict and development was well known, it was not until 1998 that the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa (A/52/871) spelled out in detail the historical legacies, the internal and external factors and the economic motives that are the causes of conflict in Africa, outlined the implications of such conflict for Africa's development and made concrete recommendations, which are still valid, to address peacemaking, peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance and for building durable peace and promoting economic growth.
Since 1998, a number of United Nations actions in Africa have been in line with the recommendations of the report, although a lot still needs to be done.
In recognition of this, the General Assembly, in its resolution 58/235 called on the Secretary-General to continue to monitor progress in the implementation of the recommendations.
9.4 In accordance with the mandate provided in the General Assembly resolutions, the programme aims to: (a) mobilize the support and galvanize the efforts of the international community for African peace and development; (b) ensure that the development of Africa remains one of the priorities of the international community; (c) promote a supportive framework for Africa's development efforts; (d) promote a coordinated and effective response by the United Nations system at the policy and operational levels in support of Africa's development; and (e) strengthen and enhance South-South cooperation.
9.5 The Office of the Special Adviser for Africa provides overall coordination and leadership of the programme, which will be under the joint responsibility of the Office of the Special Adviser for Africa, ECA and the Department of Public Information.

Programme 10 Trade and development
Overall orientation
10.1 The main objective of the programme, implemented by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO (ITC), is to maximize the trade and development opportunities of developing countries and to assist them in their integration into the world economy in a manner that enhances the development opportunities offered by the globalization process, while helping to shape international economic relations in the twenty-first century.
10.2 In the four years since the tenth session of UNCTAD, the Bangkok Plan of Action has served as a comprehensive blueprint for the work of UNCTAD and will continue to guide its work in the years to come.
The eleventh session of UNCTAD was an opportunity to identify new developments and issues in the area of trade and development that had arisen since the previous session and to generate greater understanding of the interface and coherence between international processes and negotiations on the one hand and the development strategies and policies that developing countries need to pursue on the other.
UNCTAD can play an important role in helping to ensure such coherence.
10.3 Since its inception, UNCTAD has consistently offered a perspective that looks closely at the trade- and development-related challenges of developing countries, as well as countries with economies in transition.
Through its three major pillars, namely, consensus-building, research and policy analysis, and technical assistance, it has fostered a better understanding of the development process and the factors contributing to uneven economic growth in developing countries.
Coordination and synergies among these three areas of work will continue and be enhanced.
The independent analytical capacity of UNCTAD will be enhanced to ensure the high quality of research and analysis necessary to address key issues of importance to developing countries.
The results of such analysis will support and reinforce its activities in consensus-building and technical cooperation.
In all these areas of work, particular consideration will be given to the needs of the least developed countries.
UNCTAD technical cooperation activities should also be strengthened through the implementation and follow-up of the technical cooperation strategy approved by the Trade and Development Board at its fiftieth session.
10.4 As the focal point of the United Nations for the integrated treatment of trade and development and interrelated issues in the areas of finance, technology, investment and sustainable development, UNCTAD is expected to make substantial contributions with respect to the implementation of the outcomes of recent global conferences.
It will also contribute to the implementation of international development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and to the follow-up of the comprehensive review of the progress made in that regard, to be held in 2005.
It will contribute to the implementation of and take specific actions requested in the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development, the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation adopted at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action adopted at the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, including the outcome of its review, to be held in Mauritius in 2005.
It should also contribute to furthering the implementation of internationally agreed goals contained in the Doha Ministerial Declaration adopted at the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other relevant decisions.
10.5 ITC will complement the work of its parent bodies, UNCTAD and WTO, by focusing its technical cooperation activities on supporting the efforts of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, most particularly their business sectors, to build the capacities needed to realize their full potential for developing exports and improving import operations so that they can compete in the international marketplace.
Capacity-building support is provided through information dissemination, training and advisory services.
The principal clients of such technical assistance are public and private sector institutions and institutional networks that extend specialized trade support services to the export community in partner countries.
Its principal technical cooperation partners are national networks of trade support institutions concerned with the international competitiveness of the small-scale enterprise sector.
Priority is given to Africa and the least developed countries.
10.6 UNCTAD will be responsible for subprogrammes 1 to 5, while ITC will be responsible for subprogramme 6.

Strategy
10.12 This subprogramme is under the responsibility of the Special Programme for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States.
To achieve the above objective, the Special Programme will enhance work on the special problems of the least developed countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries and the related special problems and challenges faced by transit developing countries, as well as structurally weak and small, vulnerable economies.
The work of the subprogramme will focus on improving human and institutional capabilities in those countries through research and policy analysis; making policy proposals based on such analyses; and facilitating intergovernmental discussion on issues relating to the least developed countries, including the status of least developed countries and their smooth graduation.
The causes of decline in the share of the least developed countries in world trade and the linkages between trade, growth and poverty reduction will also continue to be examined with a view to identifying long-term solutions to those problems.
Such analysis will be carried out on an annual basis in connection with the Least Developed Countries Report.
The work of the subprogramme will also focus on implementing technical assistance based on specific needs of those countries; coordinating relevant UNCTAD technical cooperation activities in favour of those countries; and participating in the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries and the ITC/UNCTAD/WTO Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme.

Programme 11 Environment
Overall orientation
11.1 In the 2006-2007 biennium, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) will continue to pursue a focused approach in the implementation of its role as “the leading global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda that promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system and that serves as an authoritative advocate for the global environment” (Nairobi Declaration, 1997).
11.2 The mandate for the programme derives from General Assembly resolution 2997 (XXVII) of 15 December 1972, which established the Governing Council of UNEP, the Environment Secretariat and the Environment Fund.
The Governing Council, in its decision 19/1 of 7 February 1997, redefined and clarified the role and mandate of UNEP in the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP.
By its resolution S/19-2 of 28 June 1997, the Assembly endorsed the new mandate of UNEP.
The Assembly elaborated further on the mandate of the Programme in its resolution 53/242 of 28 July 1999.
11.3 In line with its functional institutional structure and results-oriented approach to programme implementation, the broader international policy environment will be of particular relevance.
In this regard, the Doha Ministerial Declaration of the World Trade Organization, which gave renewed attention to trade and environment issues, the third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which acknowledged the inextricable link between environment, development and poverty, as well as the outcome of the International Conference on Financing for Development, held at Monterrey, Mexico, provide reference points, while the goals identified in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and other outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, including on international environmental governance, provide a clear and targeted road map for implementation of the programme.
11.4 The Malmö Ministerial Declaration, in which the international community stated that the root causes of global environmental degradation are embedded in social and economic problems, such as pervasive poverty, unsustainable production and consumption patterns and inequity in distribution of wealth, and the debt burden, continues to provide the broader context within which the environmental perspective must be grounded.
11.5 The programme is based on strong interlinkages between the seven subprogrammes, namely, environmental assessment and early warning; policy development and law; policy implementation; technology, industry and economics; regional cooperation and representation; environmental conventions, and communication and public information.
These strong interlinkages will be reflected in the close cooperation between the respective seven divisions, as well as with the Division of Global Environment Facility Coordination.
11.6 Environmental assessment and early warning will continue to underpin UNEP efforts and keep under review the state of the global environment and ensure that emerging environmental issues are brought to the attention of Governments.
In this regard, further efforts to strengthen the scientific basis of UNEP and the credibility of environmental data by supporting the development of improved data systems and the development of scientific capacity at the national and regional levels will be essential to develop authoritative environmental assessments and provide early warning for appropriate consideration by Governments.
11.7 The translation of scientific information and data into broad policy-based decisions requires a strong policy development component which builds on the consensus on the international environmental governance achieved at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
The emphasis will be on ensuring that UNEP supports the inclusion of environmental considerations in the broader intergovernmental policy processes, facilitates the development of coordinated approaches to environmental priorities within the United Nations system, i.e., through the Environmental Management Group, and develops innovative approaches to the broader involvement of all stakeholders in the implementation of intergovernmentally approved priorities.
11.8 A major thrust of the science-based initiatives and policy development work of UNEP will be to support implementation at the national level of intergovernmentally agreed environmental policies, particularly through greater and more coordinated efforts to develop the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition.
11.9 UNEP will further enhance the ability of countries and stakeholders to integrate environmental considerations in their decision-making structures and develop policies, strategies and practices that are environmentally sound, building on an integrated and partnership approach to sustainable development.
This will include efforts to develop more sustainable patterns of consumption and production, more efficient use of natural resources and strategic approach to management of chemicals and contribute to developing mutually supportive environment, trade and development strategies.
11.10 Increased policy dialogue and cooperation at the regional and subregional levels will support the integration of global environmental policy concerns with emerging priorities and issues at these levels.
The work of UNEP with the regional and subregional ministerial forums on the environment provides a crucial link between its policy and programme development and the actual concerns in the regions.
In the delivery of UNEP programmes, therefore, greater attention is being paid to addressing the concerns and emerging priorities of regions and subregions, especially those in the developing world, in particular Africa.
11.11 Emphasis will be given to developing more integrated and interlinked approaches to the implementation of international legal agreements that are fundamental to the achievement of environmentally sound development, as mandated by the Governing Council.
In this work, special attention will be given to complementarity between the poverty-alleviating objectives of the multilateral environmental agreements and their interlinkages with the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.
11.12 An essential ingredient of success in ensuring the implementation of environmental policy is to further increase the general understanding of critical environmental issues at all levels.
In this regard, in the development of partnerships with major groups, further efforts will be made to ensure that environmental issues are adequately covered by the international media, and that access to environmental information and encouragement of greater public participation in environmental management are met through environmental awareness-raising campaigns.
11.13 As an implementing agency of the Global Environment Facility, UNEP will continue promoting Facility-eligible activities in accordance with its mandate, as well as agreed strategic priorities for the third phase of the Facility (2002-2006).
UNEP will continue assisting all eligible countries to develop and implement projects falling within the six Facility focal areas and strive to enhance the capacity of the most vulnerable countries to implement their commitments under the Global Environment Facility-related conventions, and in this regard, special attention will be devoted to the African countries through the UNEP/Global Environment Facility New Partnership for Africa's Development initiative, least developed countries and small island developing States.
11.14 The 2006-2007 programme represents a forward-looking programme of action for UNEP based on the lessons learned in the last 30 years and the clearly articulated needs of member States, and takes as its departure point the international consensus embodied in the recent international conferences and the necessity of a results-oriented approach.
This approach embodies the understanding that environmental problems must be addressed in their social and economic context.
While it is recognized that there is a need for further policy development and guidance, there is consensus that the future emphasis of the work of UNEP must be focused on implementation, taking into account the gender perspective.

Programme 12
Human settlements
Overall orientation
12.1 Responsibility for human settlements is vested in the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), which serves as the focal point for implementation of the programme.
Under the overall development mission of reducing urban poverty and social exclusion, the goal of UN-Habitat is to improve the living and working environment in human settlements around the world.
The main substantive mandate of UN-Habitat is derived from the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II), whose goals are adequate shelter for all and the development of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world.
The mandate of the programme also derives from General Assembly resolutions 3327 (XXIX), by which the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation was established, 32/162, by which the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) was established, and 56/206 of 21 December 2001, by which the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) was elevated to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) under the intergovernmental guidance of a Governing Council, which reports to the Assembly through the Economic and Social Council.
Important recent mandates derive from the Millennium Declaration goal of achieving a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers by the year 2020, and the target on water and sanitation of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.
In addition, mandates come from relevant legislative bodies regarding Agenda 21 (chaps.
7, 21 and 28) and relevant resolutions of the Governing Council of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme.
12.2 World urban population is currently expanding at the rate of about 70 million people per year.
It is estimated that most of these people will live in overcrowded urban slums where the main challenges are inadequate housing, lack of secure tenure, uncertain employment and lack of basic services, especially safe water and sanitation.
Rapid urbanization in most developing countries has caused deterioration in shelter conditions for the urban poor while conflicts and disasters are compounding the daunting task of creating sustainable human settlements.
Central to meeting the challenge of urban poverty is replacing policies that encourage social and physical exclusion with policies that recognize and respect the rights of all, especially women and people living in poverty and those belonging to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, to an adequate standard of living, for themselves and their families, including adequate food, clothing, housing, water and sanitation, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.
In consultation with Governments, UN-Habitat develops and strengthens mechanisms for monitoring the impact of human settlements policies and programmes on the lives and work of women in cities, especially those in low-income areas and slums.
12.3 The strategy of UN-Habitat in meeting its objectives rests upon four pillars that have been translated into the four UN-Habitat subprogrammes: (a) advocacy of agreed norms for improving the lives of slum-dwellers, using as vehicles the two campaigns on secure tenure and good urban governance (Subprogramme 1: Shelter and sustainable human settlements development); (b) information generation and knowledge management, without which there can be no assessment of progress in implementing the Habitat Agenda or understanding of either the extent and condition of the world's slums or the trends in slum formation and changes in the lives of slum-dwellers (Subprogramme 2: Monitoring the Habitat Agenda); (c) field operations that tie the advocacy function to a learning process whereby technical assistance and capacity-building projects are designed to test methods and concepts that may be scaled up and transferred and to provide feedback to policy makers at all levels (Subprogramme 3: Regional and technical cooperation); and (d) facilitating financing of housing, infrastructure and other development requirements that will improve the lives of slum-dwellers on a large scale (Subprogramme 4: Human settlements financing).
12.4 The work of UN-Habitat is concentrated in developing countries, countries with economies in transition and countries where sustainable human settlements are necessary for post-conflict and post-disaster recovery (e.g., Sierra Leone, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Mozambique, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq).
UN-Habitat works directly with Governments and other Habitat Agenda partners in implementing its plan of work, including the following programmes and agencies, within their respective mandates: the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the Secretariat, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Economic Commission for Africa, the Economic Commission for Europe, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Office for Project Services, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Environment Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the Global Environment Facility, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Subprogramme 1 Shelter and sustainable human settlements development
Strategy
12.5 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Shelter and Sustainable Human Settlements Development Division (Global Division).
The subprogramme's main strategy will be global advocacy, focusing on two global campaigns: the Global Campaign for Secure Tenure and the Global Campaign on Urban Governance.
The two campaigns will be aligned with efforts to implement the goals of the Millennium Declaration as set forth in resolution 55/2, particularly on achieving significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers by the year 2020 as well as reducing by half the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water by the year 2015.
The campaigns will mobilize all Habitat Agenda partners in pursuit of these goals in order to achieve sustainable human settlements.
There shall be an effort to enhance the global visibility of the campaigns.
12.6 The global programmes entailing normative, capacity-building and knowledge management activities on secure tenure, shelter and housing and property rights, urban environment, water and sanitation, shelter and HIV/AIDS, post-conflict and post-disaster management and safer cities will be carried out within the context of the campaigns, thereby assisting in translating normative work into practical real life processes at the national and community levels.
Global programmes will, therefore, support national campaign launches and the implementation of national campaign action plans through the development of new policies and tools.
The capacity at the national and local levels to contribute to planning, management and delivery of shelter, land, infrastructure and services will be supported by a dedicated capacity-building programme, at the request of Governments.
A special feature of the strategy will be to focus on the role of women as active participants and beneficiaries in the efforts to improve shelter conditions and urban governance.
Subprogramme 2 Monitoring the Habitat Agenda
Strategy
12.7 The responsibility for the programme is vested in the Monitoring and Research Division (Urban Secretariat).
The strategy consists of:
(a) Collecting, analysing, documenting and disseminating global data and information on human settlements conditions and trends, including indicators, best practices and policies, for assessing progress towards the attainment of the goals of the Habitat Agenda, as well as the goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration as set forth in General Assembly resolution 55/2, especially on slums, safe drinking water and sanitation;
(b) Identifying, developing, testing, disseminating and mainstreaming new and innovative policies and strategies on urban planning, urban economic development, urban-rural development linkages, municipal and housing finance, urban poverty eradication and employment generation, gender and women's empowerment, partnerships and youth.
Subprogramme 3 Regional and technical cooperation
Strategy
12.8 Responsibility for the subprogramme is vested in the Regional and Technical Cooperation Division.
To achieve the objective, UN-Habitat combines normative and operational functions.
The normative functions include setting standards, proposing norms and principles and examples of best practices and good policies built on experience gained through the two global campaigns — on secure tenure and on urban governance.
The operational activities consist of policy formulation, capacity-building programmes and demonstration projects that support the normative work of UN-Habitat in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, at the request of Governments.
Women are expected to be active participants and beneficiaries of the programmes and projects implemented under this subprogramme including those aimed at mainstreaming gender issues and policies.
Subprogramme 4 Human settlements financing
Strategy
12.9 The responsibility of this subprogramme is vested in the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation (the Foundation).
The strategy for implementing the objective includes:
(a) Strengthening the Foundation for more effective mobilization of resources, both from the public and private sectors, for shelter and related infrastructure in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition, with special focus on the needs of slum-dwellers and low-income groups and on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration target on slum upgrading;
(b) At the request of Governments, providing finance for the mobilization of seed capital and technical assistance to develop and support mechanisms for mobilizing domestic savings and capital in order to improve the availability of affordable housing, adequate shelter and infrastructure in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition; and
(c) Working with the World Bank Group, regional development banks, other development banks, the private sector, United Nations agencies and other relevant partners to link the normative and technical cooperation activities of UN-Habitat with the financing institutions, and to mobilize finance from international sources to play a catalytic and preparatory role in leveraging domestic investment for slum upgrading and other pro-poor human settlements development.

Programme 13 International drug control, crime prevention and criminal justice
Overall orientation
13.1 In the United Nations Millennium Declaration the General Assembly established the achievement of sustainable development as an aim of the Organization.
Sustainable development has many dimensions.
It requires that the resources of the planet be shared so as to promote human dignity.
It further requires good stewardship of those resources so that future generations may inherit a better world.
It is also important to free individuals from the burden of “uncivil” behaviour in order to safeguard their survival, dignity and livelihood.
This aspect is at the core of the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which is mandated to assist Member States in their struggle against illicit drugs, crime and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
In the Millennium Declaration, Member States also resolved to intensify efforts to fight transnational crime in all its dimensions, to redouble the efforts to implement the commitment to counter the world drug problem and to take concerted action against international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
13.2 Actions against the world drug problem, global criminal activity and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations are a common and shared responsibility that must be addressed in a multilateral setting and require an integrated and balanced approach.
13.3 The policy directions of UNODC are grounded in: (a) the international drug control conventions, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the universal legal instruments against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations; (b) the Millennium Declaration; (c) key resolutions of legislative organs, in particular General Assembly resolution 46/152 of 18 December 1991, establishing the crime prevention and criminal justice programme, and resolutions 45/179 of 21 December 1990 and 46/185 C of 20 December 1991 on the drug control programme; (d) the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on countering the world drug problem; and (e) the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century, adopted by the Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (General Assembly resolution 55/59, annex), the related plans of action (General Assembly resolution 56/261, annex) and the recommendations resulting from the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (to be held in Bangkok in April 2005).
13.4 The three pillars of the UNODC work programme are:
(a) Research and analytical work to increase knowledge and understanding of drug, crime and terrorism issues and to expand the evidence base for making policy and operational decisions;
(b) Normative work to assist States in the ratification and implementation of international treaties, the development of domestic legislation on drugs, crime and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and the provision of secretariat and substantive services to the relevant treaty-based and governing bodies;
(c) Field-based technical cooperation projects, upon request, to enhance the capacity of Member States to counteract illicit drugs, crime and terrorism.
13.5 Globalization has created an environment where illicit drugs, crime and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations can flow easily across borders.
The gains to be had from open trade and the free flow of public goods are offset, however, by the globalization of threats to the survival, dignity and livelihood of individuals.
The interventions of UNODC are therefore designed to contribute to the following outcomes:
(a) Governments will be better equipped to fulfil and implement their obligations under the international treaties, in particular through effective judicial cooperation, prevention and countermeasures against illicit drug production, trafficking and abuse, human trafficking and other forms of organized crime, money-laundering, corruption and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations;
(b) Decisions by policy makers will be more evidence-based, relying on more extensive and intensive knowledge of issues related to illicit drugs, crime and terrorism;
(c) Civil society and public opinion will be more firmly committed to action against the illicit drug and crime problems, relying on greater awareness and understanding of the issues.
13.6 In pursuing its objectives, UNODC will make every effort to integrate and mainstream the gender perspective, particularly in its projects on prevention, the provision of alternative livelihoods and human trafficking.
Subprogramme 1
Research, analysis and advocacy
Strategy
13.7 The Division for Policy Analysis and Public Affairs is responsible for the subprogramme.
The strategy for achieving the objective will include the following main elements: (a) providing timely and accurate statistics and analyses of the world drug and crime problems; (b) expanding the evidence base for policy-making; (c) providing drug testing and forensic expert services; (d) evaluating projects, programmes and the impact of interventions; (e) developing strategic planning and analysis; (f) achieving a better balance between prevention and enforcement in programme planning and project development; (g) conducting policy dialogues with donor Governments, Member States, international organizations and private sector entities to mobilize resources; (h) reaching out to civil society, non-governmental organizations and international media; (i) carrying out targeted advocacy and communication activities, with emphasis on the media; and (j) coordinating with other United Nations agencies on issues related to drugs, crime and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
Subprogramme 2 Services for policy-making and treaty adherence
Strategy
13.8 The Division for Treaty Affairs is responsible for the subprogramme.
The objective will be achieved by pursuing a multi-pronged strategy consisting mainly of: (a) promoting the ratification and implementation of the treaties and conventions on drugs, crime and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, especially by providing legal advisory, legislative and related institutional capacity-building support services and training; (b) strengthening the legal regime against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and cooperating closely with the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council; (c) promoting judicial cooperation among countries, especially in the areas of extradition and mutual legal assistance; (d) performing secretariat functions for the Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto in force; (e) providing technical and substantive support to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the United Nations crime congresses, the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly; (f) assisting the International Narcotics Control Board to monitor and foster compliance by Governments with the international drug control treaties; and (g) coordinating and collaborating with other relevant actors, especially the institutes comprising the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice network.
Subprogramme 3
Technical assistance and advice
Strategy
13.9 The Division for Operations is responsible for the subprogramme.
The strategy for achieving the objective will include: the timely analysis of trends and the identification of emerging regional and global issues; the development and dissemination of best practices through pilot testing of new approaches and measures and desk research and publication of manuals and tool kits; the enhancement of national judicial systems; and the provision of assistance to Member States, upon request, in fulfilment of their international commitments through technical cooperation, including training, advisory services and equipment, focusing in particular on capacity-building in drug control and crime prevention, with special attention to the impact of drug- and crime-related problems on the population.

Programme 14
Economic and social development in Africa
Overall orientation
14.1 The overall objective of the programme is to enhance the capacity of African member States and their development organizations to formulate and implement appropriate policies and programmes for accelerated and sustained growth for poverty reduction, in line with the goals and priorities of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.
14.2 The mandate for the programme derives from Economic and Social Council resolution 671 A (XXV) of 29 April 1958, by which the Council established the Economic Commission for Africa.
This mandate has been further elaborated in a number of resolutions of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council as well as in resolutions 718 (XXVI), 726 (XXVII), 779 (XXIX) and 809 (XXXI) of the Economic Commission for Africa.
14.3 African countries have made significant progress in economic and social development in recent years.
Nevertheless, the rate of poverty remains intolerably high and it is not likely that the continent will attain Millennium Development Goal 1 of reducing poverty by half by 2015 at current rates of growth.
Therefore, poverty reduction has emerged as the major challenge and ultimate goal of every development intervention in Africa.
14.4 In order to address the overall long-term challenge of poverty reduction in Africa, there are several related challenges of a medium-term nature, requiring immediate and compelling action.
Key among these are:
(a) Achieving higher, sustained and equitable economic growth;
(b) Investing in the social sector to target and reach the poor, including through education, health and employment programmes;
(c) Improving stewardship of environmental and ecological resources for sustainable development, including enhancing agricultural productivity;
(d) Improving governance systems to strengthen state capacity; bridging the digital divide; and harnessing information and communication technologies for development;
(e) Accelerating regional integration and cooperation, with particular emphasis on infrastructure development, in order to increase market size;
(f) Mainstreaming trade policy into national development strategies; achieving structural diversification; and enhancing competitiveness;
(g) Ensuring gender equality and addressing the gender perspective of poverty; and building and strengthening human and institutional capacities for addressing development priorities.
14.5 The Economic Commission for Africa will respond to these challenges by implementing activities in eight interdependent and complementary subprogramme areas.
Under each of the subprogrammes, particular attention will be given to supporting member States in attaining the goals of NEPAD and the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.
As a follow-up to the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, which included landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, the programme will also give particular attention to addressing the special needs of this category of countries and accelerating their social and economic development.
14.6 Vigorous action to address the challenge of HIV/AIDS will be an essential component of the work of the Economic Commission for Africa during 2006-2007.
This will build on the research and analytical policy work currently being undertaken within the context of the Commission on HIV/AIDS and Governance in Africa, established by the Secretary-General in February 2003 and chaired by the Executive Secretary of the Commission, in order to heighten international awareness of the development impact of the disease and to encourage appropriate policy responses.
It will also continue to respond to the mandates provided in the African Consensus and Plan of Action: Leadership to Overcome HIV/AIDS, adopted by the African Development Forum in March 2000; the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases, adopted at a special summit of the Organization of African Unity in 2001; and the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session in 2001.
14.7 The modalities for action will include: advocacy and policy analysis and monitoring and tracking of Africa's progress in various areas of development; convening stakeholders and building consensus on key issues in Africa's development through forums such as the annual Conferences of African Ministers organized by the Commission, the African Development Forum and the “Big Table” meeting; and providing technical assistance and capacity-building support in the form of advisory services and training of African policy makers.
The Commission will continue to build on its existing partnerships with other United Nations agencies as well as with African regional and subregional organizations, civil society and the private sector, leveraging its comparative advantage to achieve the above objectives.
14.8 To ensure system-wide coherence, the Economic Commission for Africa will undertake its work in close cooperation and coordination with other United Nations entities, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization.
As an active member of the Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, the Commission will devote attention to clarification of the roles and responsibilities of global and regional bodies with regard to follow-up on internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.
The Commission will continue to collaborate with regional and national organizations as well as civil society and the private sector.
Subprogramme 1
Facilitating economic and social policy analysis
Strategy
14.9 The responsibility for implementing this subprogramme lies with the Economic and Social Policy Division.
The strategy will focus on the following four priority areas: (a) tracking regional and country economic performance in order to provide timely and accurate information, analysis and options for short-term policy design and for other nationally owned development programmes in the context of implementation of the objectives of poverty reduction strategy papers; (b) strengthening poverty reduction strategies, including programmes to empower the poor and to improve the delivery of basic social services targeted at the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups; (c) promoting measures to enhance financial resource mobilization for development, including reduction of debt to sustainable levels, promoting mutual accountability and aid effectiveness; and (d) strengthening statistical capacity for gathering quality data for effective monitoring and evaluation and for tracking progress towards the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.

Issues to be addressed will include access, connectivity, policy and regulatory frameworks, e-government, e-commerce, and development of local content.
These issues will be based on global and regional orientations and, in particular, on the outcome of the second World Summit on the Information Society, to be held in 2005.
Assistance will be also provided to strengthen the role of traditional means of communication for disseminating information to local communities.
Subprogramme 5 Promoting trade and regional integration
Strategy

Programme 15 Economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific
Overall orientation
15.1 Within the United Nations, the mandate of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is to promote economic and social development in the Asian and Pacific region by fostering cooperation between its members and associate members.
The mandate for the programme derives from Economic and Social Council resolutions 37 (IV) of 28 March 1947 and 414 (XIII) of 18, 19 and 20 September 1951, by which the Commission was established.
15.2 The mandate was further elaborated in General Assembly resolution 32/197 of 20 December 1977, on the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system, in which ESCAP was designated to serve as the main general economic and social development centre within the United Nations system for Asia and the Pacific and as an executing agency for intersectoral, subregional, regional and interregional projects.
The internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992, provide the overarching mandates for the United Nations and its specialized agencies, including ESCAP.
15.3 Over 800 million of the world's 1.2 billion poor people live in the Asian and Pacific region.
Over 500 million of them are suffering from hunger and disease.
The poor lack productive income, employment and assets and have insufficient access to food, basic services, infrastructure, information and decision-making opportunities, which constitutes a threat to human security, as recognized by ESCAP.
15.4 Equitable access is essential for poverty reduction.
The poor need access to health services, clean water, adequate sanitation, energy, shelter, education and training.
They also need access to markets, transport infrastructure, credit, capital and information technology to increase their productivity and income.
Furthermore, access to meaningful decision-making processes provides the poor with avenues through which to voice their concerns.
All of these are central to expanding the range of choices that the poor can have to improve their income and quality of life.
15.5 Globalization has contributed to the expansion of opportunities for the poor and societies at large.
However, this process is not automatic, as globalization can actually widen income disparities.
Countries thus need to develop the capacity to manage globalization, with the aim of maximizing its benefits and minimizing its costs.
15.6 Hence, the overall objective of ESCAP for the strategic framework for 2006-2007 will be to promote equitable access to opportunities for individuals, communities and economies, leading to the economic and social advancement of the region.
15.7 ESCAP will pursue that objective by focusing on three thematic priorities:
(a) Poverty reduction;
(b) Managing globalization;
(c) Addressing emerging social issues.
15.8 In terms of results, ESCAP will contribute to countries' efforts to build national capacity, at the request of members and associate members, in:
(a) Developing and implementing economic and social development policies and programmes, including regulatory, legal and institutional frameworks;
(b) Negotiating effectively in multilateral and regional forums;
(c) Building effective partnerships with all sectors of civil society, including the private sector;
(d) Implementing commitments from global and regional conferences and reviewing progress in achieving the internationally agreed goals and targets adopted at global and regional conferences.
Interventions will include policy advocacy and dialogue, knowledge-sharing, training and other advisory services.
The work programmes of the regional institutions will be aligned and closely coordinated with those endeavours.
15.9 As a matter of priority, the gender dimension and the rights-based as well as development-based approaches for persons with disabilities will be mainstreamed across relevant subprogrammes.
Particular attention will be given to promoting, in diverse development sectors, the rights of vulnerable groups, including women, youth, people with disabilities, older persons and people living with HIV/AIDS, especially among the poor.
15.10 To ensure system-wide coherence and avoid duplication, ESCAP will undertake work in close cooperation and coordination with other United Nations bodies and specialized agencies.
As an active member of the Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, ESCAP will devote attention to ensuring clarity in the roles and responsibilities of global and regional bodies with regard to follow-up to the outcomes of major global conferences.
ESCAP will continue to collaborate with regional, subregional and national organizations, and, at the request of members and associate members, with civil society institutions and the private sector.

Programme 16
Economic development in Europe
Overall orientation
16.1 The programme is under the responsibility of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE).
16.2 The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 36 (IV) of 28 March 1947, established the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and assigned to it responsibilities for coordination and promotion of international economic cooperation in Europe.
Further direction to the programme is provided by the Declaration on the Strengthening of Economic Cooperation in Europe and its annexed Plan of Action, both endorsed by the Council in its decision 1997/224.
Taking into account the role of the regional commissions, as set forth in Economic and Social Council resolution 1998/46 of 31 July 1998, and the goals and commitments contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development, the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing 2002, adopted at the Second World Assembly on Ageing and the related Regional Implementation Strategy Adopted in Berlin, the main objectives of the ECE work programme for the biennium 2006-2007 will be: (a) to promote the economic integration of ECE countries in the context of the post-enlargement European Union and taking into account the various stages of development of countries of the region with economies in transition (acceding countries, emerging market economies and less advanced transition economies); (b) to foster sustainable development in the countries of the region, with a focus on promoting the conditions for sustained growth and trade and improving the environment; and (c) to contribute to the economic and environmental dimensions of security in Europe.
16.3 The overall ECE programme of work is designed around nine interdependent and complementary subprogrammes, namely: Environment, Transport, Statistics, Economic analysis, Sustainable energy, Trade development, Timber, Human settlements and Industrial restructuring and enterprise development.
The core strategy involves the negotiation and implementation of conventions, norms, standards and guidelines; the promotion of dialogue in economic cooperation and development and the exchange of information and experience in the key areas of ECE work; the development of policy analysis, studies and supporting statistics; and the provision of technical assistance.
16.4 ECE will bring about a further achievement of economic integration in the region as a whole and, in particular, closer cooperation between countries of the enlarged European Union and non-acceding countries through its work in the further development and maintenance of norms and standards, with an emphasis on their implementation.
The work in this area will also have a positive impact on the rest of the world as more of the ECE-developed agreements and standards, in particular in the areas of transport, trade facilitation, statistics, energy and environmental protection, are expected to become accepted for use in non-ECE countries.
16.5 ECE will also contribute to reducing disparities and preventing the emergence of new dividing lines in Europe by promoting greater regulatory compatibility among ECE member States.
Through policy discussions, the exchange of experiences and projects, in particular for improving trade and investment flows, transport infrastructure and energy networks, the integration between the enlarged European Union and other countries will be fostered.
16.6 The work of ECE in the area of policy analysis will be covering the core United Nations development-related themes addressed in the Millennium Declaration and the outcomes of recent United Nations summits and major forums, reflecting the progress made in the region in the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals of the United Nations.
16.7 Technical cooperation activities will be carried out in accordance with the ECE Technical Cooperation Strategy, which was endorsed at the fifty-ninth session of the Commission in 2004.
Activities will be streamlined and focused on south-east Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in particular Central Asia and the Caucasus.
A unifying strategy to identify the needs of these countries and to determine activities responding thereto will be carried out with the objectives of: (a) improving national capacities to implement legally binding instruments and other regional standards, including those developed by ECE; and (b) finding solutions to address transboundary problems.
16.8 The economic and environmental dimensions of security in the region have been given a new impetus through the adoption, in December 2003, of the New Strategy Document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), in which ECE was identified as a key partner for reviewing the commitments in their economic and environmental dimensions.
ECE will, therefore, further integrate the security dimension in its relevant subprogrammes, with a view to contributing to the review and implementation of those commitments that correspond to its areas of expertise as agreed in the memorandum of understanding with OSCE and in the work plan set up between the two organizations.
Subprogramme 1 Environment
Strategy
16.9 In line with this objective, the Environment and Human Settlements Division will further promote sustainable development in the ECE region.
Work will focus on the implementation of the ECE environmental conventions and their protocols and the conduct of the second round of environmental performance reviews of countries with economies in transition.
Furthermore, the subprogramme will contribute to the implementation of the Millennium Declaration and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation in the ECE region and the outcomes of regional environment and sustainable development conferences, in particular the ministerial conferences “Environment for Europe” (Kiev 2003 and Belgrade 2007).
These activities will be undertaken in cooperation with other relevant organizations working in the region.
16.10 In particular, consistent with the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, actions will be taken to: promote multi-stakeholder participation; support processes and partnerships in the region resulting from the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the “Environment for Europe” process and the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development; contribute to the environmental dimension of security; and promote intersectoral programmes and projects, including water and environment, transport and environment, health and environment and education for sustainable development.
It will also contribute to the regional submissions related to the priority areas of the 2006-2009 programme cycle of the Commission on Sustainable Development.
Special activities for the implementation of the Commission's legally binding instruments will be undertaken, in particular supporting implementation of regional and subregional agreements and action programmes; evaluating and supporting enforcement and compliance with agreements; and providing timely and accurate environmental information.
Subprogramme 2 Transport
Strategy
16.11 In order to achieve the above objective, the Transport Division will update and improve the existing set of ECE legal instruments and recommendations governing inland transport in the region by incorporating new technological developments, political and economic changes as well as measures aimed at reducing further the number of transport accidents and the impacts of transport on the environment.
The Division will also incorporate adequate measures to address new security threats in, or related to, the transport sector.
It will extend the globalization of some of its legal instruments on transport, particularly in the areas of vehicle construction, transit, transport of dangerous goods and road safety.
This will be achieved through consensus and agreement reached at the intergovernmental meetings of the Inland Transport Committee and its Bureau, on the basis of relevant substantive documentation and provision of efficient meetings services by the Transport Division.
Dissemination of the outcome of meetings, performance of the legal and administrative functions related to international legal instruments and promotion of the implementation of these instruments and recommendations, including through advisory services, are also an integral part of the strategy.
The Transport Division provides assistance in planning and developing road and rail transport infrastructures in particular in landlocked developing countries as a follow-up to the Almaty Programme of Action.
The needs of the beneficiaries are also met through the participation of other United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) representing transport operators, other relevant industries, transport users and consumers in the above-mentioned meetings.
16.12 This strategy also applies to the Economic and Social Council Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals and its subsidiary bodies, to which the Transport Division also provides a secretariat.
Subprogramme 3 Statistics
Strategy
16.13 The Statistics Division will review existing institutional frameworks (statistical laws) and major practices in member countries and positively influence eventual revisions.
It will use recommendations made through technical cooperation activities such as bilateral advice to countries and multilateral workshops and seminars to accomplish this objective.
16.14 The subprogramme will continue to improve the comparability of official statistics in the ECE region.
This will be achieved through reviewing and updating, jointly with other international organizations, the existing statistical standards and developing new ones, when necessary.
As an integral part of its strategy, statistical assistance will be provided to the less developed countries of the region so that they can produce essential macroeconomic, social and demographic statistics, including the indicators for achieving the goals contained in the Millennium Declaration.
Furthermore, through the mechanisms established by the Conference of European Statistics, the emerging needs of official statistics will be addressed collectively by all international organizations active in the region.
For this to be achieved it is essential that the coordination role of the Conference of European Statistics vis-à-vis the statistical activities of international organizations, including the Statistical Office of European Communities (Eurostat), OECD, the International Monetary Fund, the Statistics Division of the Secretariat and CIS, be kept and further strengthened.
ECE will, therefore, continue to compile updated information on the statistical activities of the various international organizations and make it publicly available.
16.15 The ECE strategy in statistics also applies to the production and dissemination of internationally comparable statistical data on the ECE region, with the aim of contributing to the public debate and decision-making process at the national and international level.
Cooperation with other international organizations in collecting and sharing essential statistical data from national statistical offices and making efficient use of modern technologies for collection, processing and dissemination of statistics is a key part of this strategy.
Subprogramme 4 Economic analysis
Strategy
16.16 The substantive responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Economic Analysis Division.
16.17 The subprogramme will first seek to provide an international and regional perspective for national economic policy makers and, when appropriate, facilitate policy dialogue.
The Economic Survey of Europe will be used as a medium for producing analysis of economic issues, policies and problems in the ECE region, especially as they relate to core United Nations themes in the field of development.
The Survey will continue to place special emphasis on the less advanced economies, with a view to helping them catch up with other countries of the region and the rest of the world.
It is intended to strengthen the focus on structural change and institutional problems both in the Survey and at the ECE spring seminar.
In undertaking this work, the Division will do its part to ensure that its work does not duplicate that done by other organizations and that it provides clear added value, with a focus on those subregions of ECE that are not covered by other organizations.
16.18 Secondly, the subprogramme will coordinate and contribute to the work as agreed in the memorandum of understanding with OSCE and the established work plan.
16.19 Through the spring seminar and other meetings, ECE will provide a forum for policy debates on major and topical economic issues among senior economists from the government, academic and business sectors and from other international organizations.
The population-related activities will be carried out in close collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund, other international organizations and national institutions.
Using reliable data from national and international sources, including population censuses and household/family surveys, the subprogramme will conduct analyses, research and exchange of experiences relating to areas approved by the Commission for regional follow-up to the International Conference on Population and Development, the Fourth World Conference on Women, the second World Assembly on Ageing and the ECE Ministerial Conference on Ageing, held in Berlin.
Subprogramme 5 Sustainable energy
Strategy
16.20 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Industrial Restructuring, Energy and Enterprise Development Division.
In the framework of the global initiatives towards sustainable development, this subprogramme is designed to promote a sustainable energy development strategy for the ECE region.
In particular, it is to assist member States in maintaining access to high quality energy services for all individuals in the ECE region, promote the security of energy supplies in the short, medium and long term, facilitate the transition to a more sustainable energy future and promote the fuller integration of the energy economies and energy infrastructures of countries in the ECE region.
ECE will promote well-balanced energy network systems throughout the region tailored to optimize operating efficiencies and overall regional cooperation and sustained improvements in energy efficiency, production and use, particularly in countries with economies in transition.
The subprogramme will support projects, especially on gas infrastructure and transportation networks, with particular attention to the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Balkans and Southern Europe.
In the context of post-enlargement European Union, the subprogramme is to assist member States with the integration of their energy economies through the compatibility of legal, regulatory and policy measures, including business practices and the development of classification systems and guidelines, and to conduct studies on natural gas markets.
The subprogramme takes into account the goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the proposals emanating from the process on strengthening the Organization initiated by the Secretary-General in 2002.
16.21 In order to meet the objectives, ECE will work through its intergovernmental bodies, with the active participation of government officials and representatives of the energy industries, the financial community, relevant international organizations and NGOs.
It will coordinate its activities with other international organizations such as the International Energy Agency and the Energy Charter, with a view to ensuring efficient and effective use of resources and avoiding duplication.
The present structure of intergovernmental dialogue through a committee, expert groups and technical assistance projects will be reinforced by additional extrabudgetary resources which the ECE sustainable energy activities usually attract.
The international cooperation pursued by ECE bodies will have its greatest impact in this field by focusing on the key issues that strengthen national policies by providing a coherent regional context for managing inherently international problems.
While activities begin with policy dialogue, the subprogramme also provides the opportunity for policy recommendations to be implemented through international norms, standards, training programmes, technical assistance and the preparation of investment projects.
Subprogramme 6 Trade development
Strategy
16.22 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Trade Development and Timber Division.
The strategy will promote five key work areas.
First, developing and maintaining international trade facilitation instruments in response to the needs of international business, especially to support international supply chains and the integration of countries into the global economy, and to provide a platform for discussion among all actors (Governments, business and other organizations) in this regard.
This will entail maintaining electronic data interchange standards (United Nations Directories for Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (UN/EDIFACT)), extending the work of the Organization on electronic codes and developing new e-business standards.
Second, the strategy will focus on reducing barriers to trade in goods and services, especially non-tariff barriers, through greater implementation of ECE norms, standards and recommendations in trade facilitation, international harmonization and standardization and regulatory compatibility.
Third, efforts will be made to facilitate trade policy development, especially in the context of the implications of the enlargement of the European Union, the new challenges stemming from trade and security and measures to promote sustainable trade.
Fourth, the strategy will seek to add value to the Commission's well-established work in agricultural quality standards and to encourage the participation of more countries throughout the ECE region in the standards-making process.
Fifth, the ECE will encourage implementation of the trade-related norms and standards, in particular for the benefit of countries with economies in transition.
Overall, efforts will be made to support the mainstreaming of information and communication technologies and gender issues into all aspects of the subprogramme.
Subprogramme 7 Timber
Strategy
16.23 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Trade Development and Timber Division.
The work will be carried out in conjunction with relevant activities of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Labour Organization.
To support forest management, including the use of wood and forest products, which is sustainable from the ecological, economic and social point of view, it is necessary to maintain a good balance between these three aspects, based on a strong consensus about goals and methods among all stakeholders, as well as to ensure that the strategy is well integrated into the policy framework of other sectors (the cross-sectoral approach).
Achieving sustainable forest management is primarily a sovereign national responsibility.
However, regional international cooperation, through the timber subprogramme and its partners, will contribute by developing and disseminating concepts and information, sharing experience and defining standard measurement tools (indicators).
The main contribution of the subprogramme is through developing and applying analytical and monitoring tools, both on policy and on developments on the ground, collecting, validating and disseminating information and analysis, as well as stimulating the exchange of experience and joint efforts to measure progress.
While all countries benefit from international cooperation, the subprogramme recognizes a special need of the countries of CIS and south-eastern Europe, where forest sector problems tend to be more acute and national capacity weaker.
Subprogramme 8 Human settlements
Strategy
16.24 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Environment and Human Settlements Division.
The activities of the subprogramme will promote the implementation of the ECE Strategy for Sustainable Quality of Life in Human Settlements in the 21st Century and will address the goals contained in the Millennium Declaration (eradication of extreme poverty, promotion of gender equality, ensuring of environmental sustainability) as well as the regional priorities for human settlements as decided upon at the first Regional Implementation Forum on Sustainable Development, held as follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
In line with these directions, the activities of the subprogramme will promote socially, economically and environmentally sound human settlements policies.
Through capacity-building measures, the dissemination of good practices and the provision of expert assistance to countries, the subprogramme will contribute to improving housing and urban planning policies and moving those policies in a more sustainable direction, particularly through upgrading land and real estate systems, promoting social housing for vulnerable population groups, including incorporation of the gender perspective, and improving urban land use for, inter alia, sustainable transport and energy consumption.
Subprogramme 9 Industrial restructuring and enterprise development
Strategy
16.25 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Industrial Restructuring, Energy and Enterprise Development Division.
In order to meet the above objective, the Division intends to operate within and strengthen the already established network of officials responsible for enterprise restructuring and development within ministries of economy, trade, industry and finance and the major financial and non-financial public and private corporations.
In particular, through enhancing policy dialogue and exchange of experiences among policy makers, experts and private sector representatives, ECE will assist member States, upon request, in dealing with key challenges such as: the promotion of domestic and foreign investment; the creation of an environment conducive to transforming the old industries into new ones that are products of the newly emerging knowledge-based economy; the promotion of institutions facilitating new business undertakings, including business incubators, that support innovative small and medium-sized enterprises; and the strengthening of the regulatory and institutional framework for enterprise development as one important aspect of the economic dimension of security.
In this way, the most pressing and relevant industrial restructuring and modernization issues will be properly addressed in intergovernmental cooperation and debate.
At the same time, this course of action will foster the development and implementation of concerned national policies.
Where appropriate and necessary, training and education of policy makers in implementing business development strategies and creating modern institutions for promoting entrepreneurship will also be undertaken.

Programme 17
Economic and social development in Latin America and the Caribbean
Overall orientation
17.1 The overall purpose of this programme is to promote the economic and social development of Latin America and the Caribbean through interactive cooperation with member States in undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the development process and in providing the relevant operational services.
17.2 The mandate for the programme, which falls within the purview of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), derives from Economic and Social Council resolution 106 (VI), by which the Council established the Commission and entrusted it, inter alia, with initiating and participating in measures for improving the level of economic and social activity in Latin America and the Caribbean; maintaining and strengthening economic relations among the countries of the region and between them and other countries; making or sponsoring such research and studies as the Commission deemed appropriate; and undertaking or supporting member countries in the collection, evaluation and dissemination of information on regional development issues, trends and policies.
The mandate has been set forth in greater detail in various resolutions adopted subsequently by the General Assembly, the Council and the Commission.
17.3 The Commission's overall strategy for achieving the objectives of the programme is structured around 12 interdependent and complementary subprogrammes.
It is based on a proposal for improving economic growth rates, fostering international linkages for the region in the world economy and strengthening multilateral trade regimes and regional and subregional integration schemes with a view to increasing productive development with social equity and environmental sustainability.
17.4 The goals and objectives set forth in the Millennium Declaration, as adopted by the General Assembly, will be regarded as a basic source of guidelines and orientation for the implementation of activities related to the programme of work of ECLAC during the period 2006-2007.
The strategy also takes into account the relevant provisions of other United Nations global conferences, especially those related to: financing for development; multilateral trade; international migration and poverty reduction; gender mainstreaming; sustainable development at the national and international levels; and furtherance of the special needs of small island developing States.
The strategy will be implemented through an integrated approach, disaggregated in each of the subprogrammes at two levels.
On one level, the strategy is aimed at achieving stable economic growth rates and productive development with social equity and environmental sustainability, which emerges in its various dimensions in all subprogrammes, and, at another level, notwithstanding the effective specialization of each programme, the strategy places emphasis on the strong links between the subprogrammes.
Proposals for public policies focusing primarily on institution-building and the improvement of public regulation are priority aspects of such interrelationships.
The strategy places special emphasis, in terms of analytical work, on the formulation of public policies and facilitating its practical implementation by making available operational services in the areas of specialized information, technical assistance and training and by fostering cooperation at the regional and international levels.
17.5 Expected accomplishments by the end of the plan period would include:
(a) Increased effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission in the periodic systematization of information, technical assistance, the monitoring of relevant regional developments, action-oriented research and interaction with various government bodies;
(b) An analysis of development-related issues from a regional perspective, with special emphasis on new trends and their effects on the performance of Latin America and the Caribbean, using an integrated approach, and a comparative analysis of national experiences;
(c) A stronger role in communicating the region's concerns and interests in world forums and highlighting in regional forums the issues that attract world attention;
(d) Increased technical cooperation between developing countries and collaboration in subregional, regional and hemispheric integration schemes;
(e) The generation of new information to support bilateral and multilateral cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, macroeconomics and fiscal policies, productive and technological development, the efficient use of natural resources, environmental sustainability and gender mainstreaming;
(f) Wider dissemination of ECLAC outputs, modernized channels of communication and use of more effective mechanisms for targeting various user groups.
