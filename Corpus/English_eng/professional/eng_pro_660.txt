I have taken note of the 116 amendments presented today with great interest: 48 of them relate to the proposal for a decision on vocational training and 68 to development, distribution and promotion.
All the amendments bear witness to a broad consensus in Parliament about the way the Commission has approached the MEDIA programme.
There are many practical proposals for the implementation of the programme and some of Parliament' s concerns shine through these amendments.
I must say the Commission broadly shares them, just as I share most of the views expressed this evening, here in the House.
The first consideration is the acknowledged importance of the audiovisual content sector in Europe' s economy and society, now and in the future, and the need to take account of the new opportunities available, especially thanks to the new technologies, including digital technology.
That challenge means that MEDIA Plus must take greater account of the new technologies.
That is not, however, enough.
We must also follow up the Lisbon Summit, by opening up other Community initiatives.
As you are right to point out, we cannot afford to invest in production.
Producing a single major film would swallow up the entire MEDIA budget.
That is why we have tried to use MEDIA to complement what the Member States should be and are doing, but that is not enough either, and some speakers have justifiably mentioned the abortive experiment with a guarantee fund in the past.
We are working to recreate such a fund.
Indeed, I have been in touch with the president of the European Investment Bank.
We both agreed that, in order to develop the content industry in Europe, risk capital needs to be made more available and instruments established to aid investment in audiovisual content.
My officers and those of the European Investment Bank are negotiating along these lines, to establish such an investment fund as soon as possible, in the spirit of eEurope as recommended in Lisbon and confirmed in Feira.
When things start to move along I will certainly come to this House to keep you informed of progress, Mr President.
I also agree that Community policy on audiovisual media should have a wider scope but should be developed as a complement to national and regional policies in this field, and synergistically with these.
Secondly, one of the acknowledged successes of the MEDIA programme is its adaptation to the needs of businesses in the sector, especially SMEs, through financial and training support mechanisms suited to their practices and strategies.
These mechanisms must seek to overcome the obstacles of the national markets and profit fully from an enlarged area of distribution.
It is therefore essential for the implementation of MEDIA Plus to be based on professional expertise and for the support mechanisms to be accessible to the greatest possible number of businesses, in all the countries and regions making up our Community.
And that implementation must be properly balanced between the needs of the professionals and the need for transparency, and strict control of public expenditure.
In particular, Mr Perry, it must respect the financial regulation.
Thirdly and finally, I am pleased to see that Parliament shares the Commission' s opinion on the programme' s target sectors, as well as its wish to see transnational synergies developed.
I think the future of the content industry in Europe lies in coproductions.
Transnational synergy between the production and distribution sectors will be something new, with a view to a more competitive industry.
But when we talk about the culture industry, we are still talking about culture, of course, and we do want our films to travel, we do want to encourage, emphasise and achieve cultural and linguistic diversity.
It is not just a requirement of the Treaty, the people want it, and political nous recommends it.
So, ladies and gentlemen, what is the Commission' s position on the proposed amendments?
First of all, in the 'vocational training' section, I am in a position to accept in full, or in substance, 37 of the 48 amendments presented today.
Mr President, I have the list of amendments available.
In fact the only amendments I have reservations about relate, of course, to the budget.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am really embarrassed to have to stand here and say I cannot accept the figure you propose.
Personally, if I were not speaking as a Commissioner, I would consider Parliament' s figure far too low for the objectives we want to attain.
Unfortunately, we have a restrictive budgetary authority, and, unfortunately again, we have our governments, which want far less even than the budgetary authority authorises me to want.
So you see, I am forced to tell you that your proposals - though not excessive, Mrs Hieronymi - cannot be supported by the Commission.
Another factor is the exclusion of initial training: Amendments Nos 12, 110, 111 and 112.
I believe it ought to be possible to support this type of training, but not as a general rule.
We should support it as an exception and as a subsidiary activity, when no other support exists at national and European level, and in particular in order to network initial training bodies and give such training a European status.
Another problem is the exclusion of the training areas to be supported by the economic, financial and commercial management training programme: Amendments Nos 113 and 114.
You see, if we want to train professionals effectively, it is essential to teach them to understand the European and international dimensions of the market in their fields - and to do so at European level too.
Setting up international coproduction, marketing and distribution in foreign countries are all things our future audiovisual industry workers need to be taught if we want them to operate on an international scale, and that is our aim.
So there will be support for economic, financial and commercial management from a European perspective.
My fourth point is the inclusion of training for technical professions in audiovisual media, Amendment No 18, and radio, Amendment No 33.
This training is well developed at national level and, as such, it does not require a European dimension like the other proposed training.
On the other hand, I am in favour of opening up MEDIA training actions to radio professionals, which may constitute a compromise between Amendments Nos 33 and 34.
Finally, there are two declaratory amendments on encouraging fiscal measures, Amendment No 4, and intellectual property, Amendment No 9.
Although these amendments are legitimate in spirit, they go beyond the scope of the decision.
Mr President, I come now to the second part of the proposal for a directive: development, distribution and promotion.
I am willing to accept 57 amendments, 80% of the amendments tabled by Parliament, literally or in spirit.
I can make the list of these amendments available, Mr President.
I am forced to express reservations on eleven of the amendments tabled.
Four of them, Amendments Nos 53, 65, 69 and 93, are declaratory and outside the scope of the decision.
Their inclusion, while legitimate in spirit, is not justified in the text of the proposal for a decision.
It will come as no surprise that my reservations relate, in particular, to Amendments Nos 44 and 54 on the legal basis.
Article 157(3) is the legal basis proposed by the Commission, and Parliament is seeking to add another legal basis, the article on culture.
Ladies and gentlemen, I understand your position, but I think Article 157 relating to industry is the appropriate legal basis for this decision - as was already the case for MEDIA 2 - considering its subject matter, its aim and its content.
Establishing an industrial policy for audiovisual media does not mean we forget about cultural diversity, because the aim of the culture industry is precisely the achievement, on the ground, of cultural diversity.
But the choice, as legal basis, of the article relating to industry conforms to consistent case law which lays down that in the framework of the system of Community powers, the choice of the legal basis of an act must be founded on objective factors capable of jurisdictional control and such factors notably include the aim and the content of the act.
MEDIA Plus is a programme intended to strengthen the competitiveness of the audiovisual sector, but I must stress that one recital, recital 11, highlights, if that were still necessary, the cultural dimension of the audiovisual sector, in accordance with Article 151(4) of the Treaty.
I note your concerns and I really hope that the next revision of the Treaty will offer a new framework, as well measures enabling the European Parliament to be fully involved in decisions on audiovisual policy.
As regards Amendment No 87 on the budget for the second section, my comment is the same as for the amendment on the budget for the training section.
So I need not go over it again.
As regards Amendment No 103 on radio, MEDIA Plus cannot be extended to other sectors given the financial constraints, but I have already made one concession, in the training section, to including radio in the programme.
On Amendments Nos 115 and 116, regional and minority languages, the Commission is, as you know, very concerned about respect and promotion of linguistic and cultural diversity.
Moreover, this concern is taken into account throughout the MEDIA Plus programme, primarily through positive discrimination measures in the support mechanisms in favour of professionals operating in countries and regions with low production capacity and with a limited geographic or linguistic scope.
Amendment No 115 would create a sub-programme within the programme.
So I do not think we should go that far.
But Amendment No 116 actually does nothing more than take up and specify the measures which are already scattered throughout the programme.
So, if Parliament really wants it, and so decides, I will not oppose that amendment.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, beyond these few points of disagreement, which are minimal, I want to express my satisfaction at the cooperation and the many points of agreement between the Commission and Parliament.
The amendments proposed today, which are of a high quality, will undoubtedly make it possible to improve the texts establishing the MEDIA programme.
They will contribute to achieving our goal: the creation of a strong content industry in Europe.
With our MEDIA Plus programme we are seeking to complete all the other actions which should restore to the European cinema not its credibility, because that was never lost, but its confidence, because it is by having confidence in the ability of the European cinema that we will succeed in developing it as we all wish.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Quality evaluation in school education
The next item is the report (A5-0185/2000) by Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, concerning a proposal for a European Parliament and Council recommendation on European cooperation in the domain of quality evaluation in school education (COM(1999) 709 - C5-0053/2000 - 2000/0022(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the EU' s key goals is to promote mobility within the labour market, and this can only be stimulated by high-quality education.
It is therefore essential to develop tools not only to improve education, but also to ensure that education meets modern-day requirements.
Quality assessment, self-assessment of schools in particular, is a key element in the development of quality education.
This is why, all in all, I am delighted with the Commission' s recommendation that is now before us.
However, I also have some comments with regard to the recommendation, and I included these in my report.
In my opinion, it is especially important to encourage Member States to develop sound methods for assessment in education, bearing in mind that self-assessment is complementary to external evaluation.
In addition, it is important for them to exchange good models and experiences and that all those involved in the school are actually involved in the self-assessment process, including parents and students.
Moreover, it is important to stimulate cooperation between schools and various bodies, also at local and regional level.
Good examples of this can be found in the trial projects and also, of course, at European level.
What the Commission needs to do, therefore, is to draw up an inventory of sound existing methods, in order to set up a database which can be used interactively so that activities can be scheduled and regular reports submitted to Parliament by putting the item on the running agenda.
I have drawn on many ideas from my fellow delegates, but also from many institutions in the sphere I mentioned above.
It transpired in the process that the will to turn this project into a success is present on all sides, and the impetus created by the EU has certainly found fertile soil.
It is therefore all the more unfortunate that repeated attempts on my part to reach agreement with the Council - because you know it was my intention to complete the report at first reading - were thwarted time and again and met with reactions that came too late and insufficient mandate.
I would therefore call on the Council to come up with a proposal for a common position within the short term.
We are nearly there, but I would first of all like to clarify the line adopted by our Parliament, so that we can coincide with the line taken by the Council.
Finally, we reached general agreement in the committee on a large number of amendments.
I thank you all for your very constructive attitude.
I would now ask you for your support to deliver on these agreements.
I would advise you not to pursue the amendments tabled by the PSE.
It is important to couple education with the labour market.
This is borne out by the results reached in Lisbon.
After all, we should not educate people for unemployment, and education needs to pre-empt this.
This is why this should also be included in this report.
The other amendments are already more or less reflected in the text or in other amendments.
Finally, I would like to mention the financial dimension.
I have not made any changes on purpose, not because I think the budget is generous but because I think that it will appear from the reports whether the budget is too tight.
That will then be a good time to consider a possible increase in the funding.
I thank you and look forward to your reactions.
Mr President, it was late when I made my last speech, it is even later now so I shall be try to be even briefer.
But education is important and we must make sure it gets the attention it deserves.
Often education attracts fine words.
What it does not always get is the action to match those words.
We all know the EU has very limited responsibilities as regards education, but there are some places where the European Union can give added value.
Quality evaluation is one of those.
When I went into town earlier on this evening I saw young people in the city of Strasbourg looking at leaflets up on a wall.
What they were looking at were their baccalaureate results.
So we think nothing about evaluating youngsters.
What we need to do is evaluate the schools and to make sure that the schools are doing well.
Since the schools are preparing young people for an education in the single market of Europe, we must make sure that the schools across Europe are all doing their work to prepare people for the single market those young people are going to work in.
In some parts of the Union - and I am quite willing to cite the United Kingdom - we are not doing as well as we could.
There are very many bright youngsters who do very well in the schools, but 20% of young people leave British schools without any qualifications at all.
We cannot afford to allow that to continue to happen.
There have been estimates that in the next two years we will require half a million extra people in IT jobs.
Where are those young people going to come from?
We have to make sure that the schools can deliver them and I am quite sure that what is contained in this report is one of the ways that we can help raise the standards in schools.
In English we say "two heads are better than one" .
I am quite prepared to believe that 15 heads, or 15 sets of data across the Union, will help us achieve better quality in the schools.
I would just say to the Council - and I hope there is somebody from the Council listening to this - I know we can have confidence in the Commissioner, but let us say to the Council that their fine words at Lisbon were great but they should now deliver on them.
I am therefore very sorry that the great efforts that the rapporteur made to get full agreement were not actually rewarded.
So do not be too surprised if this Parliament backs the rapporteur and tries to push the Council to live up to the fine words they were so ready to utter.
Mr President, building Europe means first and foremost being aware of its diversity and its differences.
In studying the educational systems of the Member States of the European Union we should draw on a profound knowledge of the practices and acquired rights in our various countries, because each of our countries has its own educational reality.
Any change to the educational system calls into question the ideology of the society and its economic development.
Quality in education is a challenge for our society, but education must not become a focus for social operators who want to impose their personal aims upon it.
If an in-depth reform of the educational system is needed, it must involve all the partners in the system and, above all, it must not be rigid.
It must be capable of evolving in step with society because educational systems suffer when they are not rooted in life.
But for all that, we must not forget that the all-round development of the human being is an essential goal of education.
We must not seek to respond at any price to a constantly developing market.
On the contrary, we must let young people acquire the tools of knowledge which allow them to face their future.
Today, the concern is certainly not to wait for pupils to fail, at the end of their schooling, before showing some imagination.
They need to be offered appropriate teaching.
No child is devoid of talent.
Every system creates its own type of failures.
The criteria for identifying failure are essentially subjective.
Success is judged according to pre-established standards.
What are those standards?
How have they been established?
Depending on the circumstances, politicians may even find it in their interests to exaggerate or minimise things that are going wrong, especially as the problems of education occupy a growing place in the political debate and the media.
Any pupil in difficulties is a young person whose future is compromised.
Any child who is failing is expressing his unease in the educational institution, but also in society.
A young person who is not recognised as an individual with his own experiences and his own knowledge is a rejected human being.
In rejection he will give vent to his despair; he will give vent to his hatred.
The fight against failure at school, in other words, against failure in society, is and must be a major concern for anyone with political responsibility.
So it is time to regard the young person as a developing being, wishing to train himself rather than being trained.
Perhaps we should change the way we approach knowledge and review the operation of our educational systems, but we must be careful not to seek uniformity because the multiplicity of cultures is a source of personal enrichment and a condition for successful human development.
There is no miracle cure, but there are battles to be fought.
And that means that all those who believe it must combine forces to do so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is almost midnight already, and I do not wish to extend this sitting unnecessarily.
I agree with what Mrs Roure and Mr Perry have said and, of course, with the content of Mrs Sanders- Ten Holte's report.
I should like to confine myself to a couple of points, and I shall begin by referring back to Feira and Lisbon.
This report is really a follow-up to the thoughts of the European Council meetings in Lisbon and Feira.
When we contemplate the information society and globalisation, when we consider the speed at which technology is changing our society, it becomes obvious that we must guarantee a school education that enables young people to stay abreast of these developments.
We must create the basis for the essential establishment of lifelong learning.
For that reason, I approve of the measures that are proposed here.
They will probably help us to deal more effectively with this challenge.
Let me just come back to a point that I raised myself in an amendment.
It must be possible to work with the existing resources, with the available networks and databases.
There is no need for us to keep reinventing the wheel.
We should use what we have, comparing the knowledge we each possess and then operating on the basis of that knowledge.
I shall move on now to a technical point.
In recent days we have heard that Mrs Sanders has been trying to make the first reading suffice.
But of course there is a price to pay for that.
Whoever wants to shorten the legislative process to one reading by making use of the scope for interinstitutional agreements has to conclude a deal.
This deal does not involve a decree from the gentlemen of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, who have no say; they must simply declare their acceptance of the sound parliamentary proposals.
They have not made such a declaration; they did promise us something, but we set no store by promises.
We shall vote on our report tomorrow.
Thereafter, if the gentlemen of Coreper feel able to accept our amendments, we are prepared to expedite the matter very swiftly in the autumn - there is no rush.
We should not buy a pig in a poke; we should vote on our report tomorrow and give these gentlemen the opportunity to think again.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to what has been said already, with which I can only concur, may I reiterate that the foundations for the future prospects of the youth of tomorrow are laid in the classrooms of today and that brainpower will be the key asset of the future.
Among the basic skills we now have to learn is how to teach young people to cope with the rapid changes that are taking place in the present era.
These basic skills also include the ability to motivate individuals to engage in lifelong learning, to arouse their curiosity, to foster their willingness to be mobile, flexible and open-minded and to accept responsibility and to train them to be independent.
Let me just cite one example of this motivation and support.
In my own country of Austria, this type of benchmarking, in the form of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Pop 3 study, in which we did not perform particularly well, has led to the establishment of a programme known as Qualität in Schulen (Q.I.S - Quality in Schools).
At the heart of this project is the school curriculum.
It contains a model for schools to follow and statements relating to the present situation and enumerates specific aims and measures for the promotion of quality in various areas.
It is a fixed-term agreement with an impact inside and outside schools, providing guidelines for educational practice as well as information for the public and serving as a planning instrument and a yardstick against which the development of a school can be measured.
Comparison creates competition, and competition promotes individuality among schools and hence a variety of models for guidance.
This is the path we must pursue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been, as always, great harmony between the views of Parliament and those of the Commission.
The quality of education, and quality evaluation, are indispensable, as you have said, essential to being able to improve educational systems.
Of course, it is not always easy for ministers to look at comparative results because those at the top of the class are very proud and show their pride, but the others have to answer difficult questions before their national parliaments.
So we have to recognise that accepting quality control can sometimes be very difficult for education ministers, but it is indispensable, as everyone has said this evening, if we want to improve school systems.
Let me first thank your rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, for producing such an excellent report in a very short time.
She has been supported by Mrs Marie-Hélène Gillig, who championed the issue in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and she has also been supported, of course, by the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, who have tabled some very interesting amendments.
I must also stress the very positive attitude of the Portuguese Presidency, which has moved this issue forward, and I join you in regretting that it has not been possible to complete matters at first reading.
But it is Parliament' s decision, and Parliament' s alone, to complete at first reading or to go further.
You will probably decide to go further and the Commission will follow you down that road, hoping that, with lots of goodwill on both sides, we can reach agreement as soon as possible.
The proposal for a recommendation which you have before you relates to one of the key questions at the heart of our priorities: how can we ensure, and how can we improve, the quality of education?
You are aware that during the last few years the Commission has initiated several activities in this connection.
First, there has been a vast pilot project on quality evaluation, launched in 1997, and the proposal for a recommendation is based largely on the conclusions we have drawn from that pilot experiment, of evaluation as instrument of improvement of the quality and role of European cooperation in this domain.
Quality evaluation is essential if we want to make progress in the future, because improving basic skills will allow us to make a success of, and profit fully from, the opportunities offered our young people in the new knowledge society.
As you have said, the Lisbon European Council emphasised the importance of modern systems of education.
We must breathe life into those Lisbon declarations.
They are revolutionary declarations, because it was the first time a Council really concentrated on what is important, beyond economics and finance, that is, the foundation of our society, knowledge.
You know I have already started work on the eLearning programme and we are now following up with the quality programme as I have already presented the first report on quality, based on sixteen quality criteria drawn up by the Member States and OECD specialists.
Mr President, some Members have asked me to return here frequently to discuss these issues.
That too has already been decided, because quality control has become a priority in the Council' s new cooperation framework, the 'rolling agenda' ministers have agreed on.
This means it will come up at almost every Council of Ministers and will not be a overnight project.
It will be quite apparent to everyone that it is an extended project and progress in the Member States will be evaluated regularly at intervals of a few months
Let me now come to the amendments Parliament wants to make to our proposal.
The Commission will accept all the amendments tabled, in full, in substance or in part.
A number of amendments in fact seek to strengthen the follow-up measures which have already been recommended by the Commission.
For example, Amendment No 40 invites the Commission to define a plan for a follow-up in close cooperation with the Member States.
That is already the case.
In the same vein, I am delighted with Amendment No 42, which allows the Commission to submit new follow-up proposals three years after the adoption of the recommendation.
Everything evolves so rapidly that I do think this is a logical course of action.
Other amendments aim to extend the political range of the recommendation and I am very pleased with them.
So that is the sense in which I accept Amendments Nos 17 and 18, seeking to associate the candidate countries, as of now, in European cooperation as regards quality evaluation.
I recently met the ministers of those countries at the Bucharest Conference, and they expressed a strong desire to be included in that cooperation.
Besides, I have to tell you that on examining the evaluation that has been done, it was found that the candidate countries are often well ahead of European averages in terms of educational quality.
We should not imagine that we are the best at everything: education in those countries is sometimes remarkable.
I also accept Amendments Nos 1 to 14, which propose new recitals.
Similarly, I agree in principle with Amendment 36 which refers to the Eurydice information network.
I share the opinion of Parliament that we should base ourselves on existing networks wherever possible.
It is certainly true that the Eurydice network, and in particular European unity, can support European cooperation as regards evaluation by making a common platform of basic knowledge available to the various players.
However, I think it is difficult to entrust responsibility for coordinating experience in this area to the networks.
Amendment No 36 could therefore be accepted by the Commission subject to rewording to take account of the capacities and characteristics of the Eurydice network.
Besides, I think the reference to Eurydice would be better placed in the invitations to the Commission rather than in the part relating to the Member States.
Anyway I could agree to a reworded Amendment No 36.
I am also delighted with Amendments Nos 21 to 35, which clarify the invitations to the Member States.
Amendments Nos 27 and 31 seek to introduce a reference to benchmarking, but I have to tell Parliament that the benchmarking system still gives ministers problems because the definition is not yet perfect.
So ministers and the Commission were very pleased to be able to accept a Dutch initiative to bring experts and ministers together, in the autumn, to find a better definition.
Naturally, Parliament will be informed of the results of that conference.
In conclusion, I want to stress that we are on the right road to arriving at a positive decision.
I hope with all my heart that the Council will rally to that decision, which is the result of a very broad consensus between Parliament and the Commission.
I hope the Council can adopt its common position as soon as possible, and if there are controversial points they could be the subject of compromise at second reading.
I want to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, its rapporteur and its members once again for the quality of their work.
Quality is not confined to school; it is here in the European Parliament too.
That is something that needs to be said more often.
Many thanks, Commissioner Reding, especially for the fact that we shall now be able to go home before midnight.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for staying the course!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
