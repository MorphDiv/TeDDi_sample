In the absence of the President, Mr. Verbeke (Belgium), Vice-President, took the Chair.
The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
Agenda item 164
Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Sudan
Report of the Fifth Committee (A/59/780)
The Acting President (spoke in French): If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the report of the Fifth Committee that is before it today.
It was so decided.
The Acting President (spoke in French): Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote.
The positions of delegations regarding the recommendation of the Fifth Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records.
May I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that
“When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee”.
May I also remind delegations that, in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes.
Before we begin to take action on the recommendation contained in the report of the Fifth Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take a decision in the same manner as was done in the Fifth Committee.
The Assembly has before it a draft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 8 of its report.
The Assembly will now take a decision on the draft resolution.
The Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote.
May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the same?
The draft resolution was adopted (resolution 59/292).
The Acting President (spoke in French): The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 164.
The meeting rose at 10.10 a.m.
