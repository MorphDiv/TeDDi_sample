General and complete disarmament
Assistance to States for curbing illicit traffic in small arms and collecting them
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Introduction
In its resolution 59/74, the General Assembly, inter alia, requested the Secretary-General and those States and organizations in a position to do so, to provide assistance to States for curbing the illicit traffic in small arms and collecting them.
By the same resolution, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to continue to consider the matter and to report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.
In its resolution 59/86, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to continue to hold broad-based consultations with all Member States and interested regional and subregional organizations on further steps to enhance international cooperation in preventing, combating and eradicating illicit small arms and light weapons.
In the same resolution, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to report to it at its sixtieth session on the implementation of the resolution.
The present report is submitted pursuant to resolutions 59/74 and 59/86.
Assistance to States
In response to a request for assistance from the Government of Burundi, an inter-agency fact-finding mission, under the framework of the Coordinating Action on Small Arms (CASA) mechanism, was dispatched to that country from 19 to 25 February 2005.
Taking into account the request of the Government of Burundi, within the framework of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, the mission had the following objectives: to determine the state of affairs in the country regarding the problem of illicit small arms and light weapons; to assess what initiatives, if any, had been put in place by the Government; to determine which activities had been supported or put in place by the international community; to examine the functioning and needs of the Burundi national focal point for small arms; and to define how best the United Nations could assist with the problem.
Members of the mission met with several Government officials, members of the donor community, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and other representatives of the United Nations system in Burundi, as well as representatives of NGOs and civil society organizations.
Based on information received, the mission concluded that, after more than 10 years of civil war and political instability, Burundi is grappling with the challenges of post-conflict peacebuilding and that the proliferation of illicit weapons in the country is a serious and widespread problem caused by a combination of political, socio-economic and security factors that equally affects the neighbouring countries of Burundi.
Another inter-agency fact-finding mission, composed of staff from the Department for Disarmament Affairs, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), under the framework of CASA, was undertaken in Guinea-Bissau from 7 to 11 March 2005, at the request of the Government of Guinea-Bissau.
The mission concluded that the widespread presence of illicit small arms and light weapons in the country poses a serious threat to its political stability and may exacerbate the crime situation in the country.
Based on the findings of the mission, a project proposal was developed, inter alia, to provide support for the establishment of a national commission to coordinate the country policies related to small arms and light weapons and the development of a pilot weapons-collection programme.
It is expected that the project will be launched in the fourth trimester of 2005.
In addition to the above-mentioned missions, the UNDP, in collaboration with the Department for Disarmament Affairs, organized in May 2005 a series of workshops in six Southern African countries aimed at enhancing their capacity to implement the Programme of Action.
The countries were Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
That assistance was provided within the framework of the “Capacity development for reporting to the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms” project, which was jointly developed and implemented by the Department for Disarmament Affairs, UNDP and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), in collaboration with the Small Arms Survey.
In yet another effort aimed at assisting Member States, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs recently launched a peacebuilding portal, an online database containing profiles of African peacebuilding NGOs, including those working on small arms control and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration issues.
The database is intended to facilitate access by Member States to information on existing expertise in the aforementioned areas.
Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects
United Nations system
General Assembly
Open-ended Working Group to Negotiate an International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons
Pursuant to paragraphs 8 and 9 of resolution 58/241, the Open-ended Working Group held its second substantive session from 24 January to 4 February 2005 and its third and last substantive session from 6 to 17 June 2005.
At the conclusion of its work, the Working Group reached agreement on a draft of a politically binding international instrument to enable States to identify and trace, in a timely and reliable manner, illicit small arms and light weapons.
The draft instrument will be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session for adoption.
The instrument contains a number of provisions outlining requirements for the marking of small arms and light weapons, record-keeping and cooperation in tracing.
Under those provisions, States would commit themselves, inter alia, to: marking all small arms and light weapons at the time of their manufacture; taking all necessary measures to ensure that all small arms and light weapons in the possession of Government armed and security forces for their own use are duly marked; ensuring that accurate and comprehensive records are established for all marked small arms and light weapons within their territory; and providing prompt, timely and reliable responses to tracing requests made by other States.
The instrument also contains provisions for follow-up by which, among other things, States would commit themselves to reporting on a biennial basis to the Secretary-General on their implementation of the instrument.
They also agreed to meet biennially to consider the reports submitted to the Secretary-General.
Broad-based consultations on further steps to enhance international cooperation in preventing, combating and eradicating illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons
Pursuant to paragraph 5 of General Assembly resolution 59/86, the Department for Disarmament Affairs continued to hold broad-based consultations on further steps to enhance international cooperation in preventing, combating and eradicating illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons with all Member States and interested regional and subregional organizations.
Informal consultations open to all Members States, entities of the United Nations system, non-governmental organizations and experts in the field were held in New York and Geneva, respectively, on 1 and 8 July 2005.
In preparation for the broad-based consultations, the Department organized two workshops on the illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons, with financial support from the Governments of the Netherlands and Norway.
The workshops, which were held in New York on 31 May 2005 and in Geneva on 3 June 2005, were aimed at providing delegates with an enhanced understanding of issues related to illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons.
The Department also held informal consultations on the margins of other meetings it organized, such as: a regional symposium on the implementation of the Programme of Action by the Arab States, held in Algiers 11 to 13 April 2005; a United Nations workshop on small arms and light weapons, held in Beijing from 19 to 21 April 2005; a meeting on the implementation of the Programme of Action organized by the Organization for Security and Cooperation on 25 April 2005; the Organization of American States Forum on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures, held in Washington, D.C., on 25 and 26 April 2005; a workshop on transfer control initiatives for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), held in Nassau on 12 May 2005; a United Nations regional workshop on conventional arms, held in Nairobi from 31 May to 2 June 2005; a workshop on transfer control initiatives for the Andean Community, held in Lima from 19 to 20 May 2005; and a workshop on transfer controls initiatives for the MERCOSUR region, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, on 2 June 2005.
During the consultations, general agreement emerged for States to adopt laws and regulations to control brokering and to develop regional and global agreements on the brokering of small arms and light weapons.
It was noted that the existing regional and subregional agreements concerning brokering cover more than 120 countries.
It was suggested that the existing regional and subregional agreements could provide a basis for discussions on a global instrument regarding arms brokering.
However, the issues of extraterritorial jurisdiction and the definition of the scope of brokering activities remain controversial.
With regard to the establishment of the group of governmental experts mandated by General Assembly resolution 59/86, some Member States suggested that further discussion should be undertaken at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly regarding the mandate and scope of the work of the group of governmental experts.
Suggestions were made that the group should, among other things, address funding, banking and shipping activities, licensing systems, the definition of illicit brokering, and the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction.
Member States also suggested that the group address the link between illicit brokering and the inadequacy of end-user certificates, as well as marking and tracing.
Some Member States suggested that the group should also look into the feasibility of the development and adoption of an international instrument to regulate brokering and that a decision on the nature of the instrument (legally binding or not) be taken either by the General Assembly at the time of conferring the mandate on the group or following submission of the final recommendations of the group.
In order to have a realistic picture of the problem, it was also suggested that the members of the group undertake missions to the field with a view to consulting with experts in the field, legal brokers and NGOs.
The issue of international cooperation and assistance was also discussed extensively, in particular with regard to the importance of financial and technical assistance and capacity-building, as well as the importance of information and intelligence exchanges among States.
Stressing the importance of continued awareness-raising initiatives, Member States requested the Department for Disarmament Affairs to continue organizing such meetings.
Second Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects, at the national, regional and global levels
By its resolution 59/86, the Assembly decided to convene the Second Biennial Meeting of States to consider the implementation of the Programme of Action at the national, regional and global levels at Headquarters from 11 to 15 July 2005.
The Meeting was chaired by Pasi Patokallio, Ambassador of Finland to Canada.
The Meeting held 10 plenary meetings to consider the national, regional and global implementation of the Programme of Action, including international cooperation and assistance.
Seventy-nine national statements were made by representatives of participating States and one observer State.
Statements were also made by representatives from six international and regional organizations, as well as by representatives of the International Action Network on Small Arms and the World Forum on the Future of Sport Shooting Activities.
At the time of the Meeting, 100 national reports had been submitted to the Secretariat.
The Meeting held thematic discussions within the framework of consideration of issues related to: weapons collection and destruction; stockpile management; disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; marking and tracing; capacity-building; resource mobilization; institution-building; linkages to terrorism, organized crime, trafficking in drugs and precious minerals; import/export and illicit brokering; human development; public awareness and the culture of peace; and the effects of small arms and light weapons on women, children and the elderly.
The discussions at the Second Biennial Meeting of States highlighted the fact that illicit small arms and light weapons continued to pose a complex and multifaceted challenge to international peace and security, social and economic development, human security, public health and human rights, among others.
Consequently, the successful implementation of the Programme of Action has to take into account the cross-cutting nature of the problem and, therefore, requires a holistic, integrated and coherent approach covering all its dimensions.
Although it was generally agreed that there was increasing consensus or common understandings on many of the fundamental issues relating to the problem of illicit small arms and light weapons, other issues, such as transfers to non-State actors and the matter of civilian possession of firearms, remain controversial.
Security Council
On 17 February 2005, the Security Council held an open debate on the issue of small arms (see S/PV.4896) to consider the report of the Secretary-General on small arms (see S/2003/1217), regarding the implementation of the 12 recommendations contained in his report of 20 September 2002 on ways and means by which the Security Council could contribute to dealing with the question of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in situations under its consideration (see S/2002/1053).
Those recommendations covered four main topics: implementation of the Programme of Action; actions and arms embargoes mandated by the Security Council; conflict prevention, peacebuilding and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants; and confidence-building.
At the conclusion of its debate, the Security Council adopted a presidential statement (see S/PRST/2004/1), by which, inter alia, the Council welcomed the report of the Secretary-General and requested him to update it at its next meeting on further implementation of the recommendations contained in his report of 20 September 2002.
In addition, on 25 February 2005, the Security Council held an open debate on cross-cutting issues in West Africa.
The Council had before it the report of the Secretary-General on ways to combat subregional and cross-border problems in West Africa (see S/2005/86).
At the conclusion of the debate, the Security Council adopted a presidential statement (see S/PRST/2005/9), by which the Council, inter alia, expressed its deep concern about the involvement of individuals, including those from security and armed forces, in illicit activities such as smuggling firearms, drugs and natural resources.
The Council emphasized the need to pursue security sector reforms with a view to improving civil-military relations in countries emerging from conflict situations, creating a culture of peace and stability and promoting the rule of law.
Coordinating Action on Small Arms1
During the period under review, a number of activities were carried out under the framework of the Coordinating Action on Small Arms mechanism (CASA).
The Department for Disarmament Affairs, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and UNDP continued their efforts to support the Sri Lanka national commission on small arms and light weapons through a joint project launched in 2003.
From 30 March to 4 April 2005, the Department for Disarmament Affairs, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and UNDP undertook an advisory mission to Sri Lanka with a view to assisting with the operationalization of the national commission.
Assistance was also provided to more than 115 developing countries under the project “Capacity development for reporting to the United Nations Programme of Action on small arms”, which was jointly designed and is implemented by the Department for Disarmament Affairs, UNDP and UNIDIR, in collaboration with the Small Arms Survey.
That assistance was provided mainly through regional workshops and an online help desk.
The project also supported the organization of national workshops with relevant national authorities and national commissions in six countries in Southern Africa, as mentioned in paragraph 7 above.
As part of a strategy to raise awareness about the CASA mechanism in the field and improve coordination among United Nations offices at the country level on actions related to small arms and light weapons, the Department for Disarmament Affairs organized the first CASA consultation meeting in the field in Brasilia on 31 May 2005.
That consultation resulted in a firm commitment by the United Nations offices in Brasilia to consult one another and make an effort to coordinate their assistance with the efforts of the Government of Brazil in implementing the Programme of Action.
Similar consultation meetings are being planned in other countries of the region during the remainder of 2005.
Department for Disarmament Affairs
In accordance with paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 59/86, the Department for Disarmament Affairs continued to collate and circulate data and information provided by States on a voluntary basis, including national reports, concerning the implementation of the Programme of Action, national legislation on small arms and light weapons and national points of contact for the implementation of the Programme of Action.2
The Department for Disarmament Affairs organized or co-organized conferences, seminars and workshops in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean, including a regional seminar on small arms and light weapons for the South Pacific, held in Nadi, the Fiji Islands, from 18 to 20 August 2004; a workshop to assess Latin American preparations for the 2005 Biennial Meeting of States on small arms and light weapons, held in Lima from 9 to 10 September 2004; a workshop on disarmament and development, held in Lima from 27 to 29 September 2004; a regional symposium on the implementation of the Programme of Action by the Arab States, held in Algiers from 11 to 13 April 2005; a workshop on small arms and light weapons, held in Beijing from 19 to 21 April 2005; workshops on transfer control initiatives, held in Nassau on 12 May 2005; a workshop on transfer control initiatives for the Andean Community, held in Lima from 19 to 20 May 2005; and a workshop on transfer control initiatives for the MERCOSUR region, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, on 2 June 2005.
The Department also carried out the following activities during the period under review: technical assistance for the development of firearms legislation, common criteria for the import, export and transit of firearms and capacity-building for law enforcement officials of Latin America and the Caribbean; technical assistance to members of parliaments of countries of MERCOSUR and Associated States, as well as for countries of the Andean Community, in analysis of the status and drafting of national firearms legislation and related international instruments; improvement of two training facilities at police academies in Costa Rica and Uruguay to carry out future subregional courses; and training courses on intelligence and international cooperation at the recently created Regional Public Security Training Centre in Brazil.
In addition, the Department provided practical assistance in the destruction and removal of 52,000 firearms in Brazil, Costa Rica and Paraguay and the destruction of more than 96 tons of ammunition and explosives in Paraguay, as well as in improving the security of weapons facilities, including licensing and storage-management systems.3
The two-year pilot small arms education project implemented by the Department and the Hague Appeal for Peace in Albania, Cambodia, the Niger and Peru, was successfully concluded on 31 January 2005.
A book entitled Peace and Disarmament Education: Changing Mindsets to Reduce Violence and Sustain the Removal of Small Arms was published and is available through the Department or the Hague Appeal for Peace.
The book contains reports from each of the four country projects.
The reports describe the main activities carried out and assessments of the behavioural and attitudinal impact of the projects on the student, teachers, the students-teachers, school administrators and principals, as well as Ministry of Education personnel.
The book also contains a detailed substantive educational evaluation of the projects and an organizer's manual to assist in the replication of the projects in other countries.
Department of Peacekeeping Operations
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations plays an important role in the implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes in peacekeeping missions.
Currently, there are six peacekeeping missions (in Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Haiti, Liberia and the Sudan) that include specific provisions for weapons collection and destruction in the planning and implementation of their disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes.
Those operational disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities are undertaken within a regional context, which emphasizes the monitoring of the illicit flows of small arms and light weapons and the monitoring of arms embargoes.
Some of those disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes also emphasize weapons collection strategies at the community level, which are complemented by support to develop small arms and light weapons control regimes and the capacity of national Governments to deal with the proliferation of such weapons.
In addition to those operational activities, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations is leading a joint United Nations inter-agency4 initiative to develop comprehensive and coherent United Nations policies, guidelines and procedures on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, as well as a web-based United Nations resource centre on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.
Department of Public Information
The Department of Public Information has utilized its television, radio, print, outreach and Internet channels, as well as its network of the United Nations information centres and services, to call the attention of the international community to the dangers associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.
During the period under review, the Department of Public Information United Nations News Centre, one of the most heavily visited segments of the United Nations website, currently available in all official languages, continued to cover a wide range of events and developments related to the question of small arms and light weapons.
Those issues were also featured in the Department of Public Information daily radio live broadcasts, current affairs magazines and television programmes, including three “UN in Action” news stories and three “World Chronicle” television shows.
A number of small arms-related stories were also carried by UNIFEED, the new daily satellite feed that reaches, through the Associated Press Television News Agency, more than 500 television stations around the world.
The issue of small arms and light weapons was discussed in United Nations institutional publications and addressed in the context of the annual DPI/NGO Conference on the theme “Millennium Development Goals: civil society takes action”, which was held in September 2004 at Headquarters.
Furthermore, the Department of Public Information sent a guidance note to United Nations information centres and its other field offices encouraging them to implement relevant public information programmes at the national level.
On the occasion of the third substantive session of the Open-ended Working Group on tracing illicit small arms and light weapons and of the Second Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action, held from 6 to 17 June 2005, the Department of Public Information, in collaboration with the Department for Disarmament Affairs, updated a booklet entitled Small arms and light weapons: selected United Nations documents.
The two departments also collaborated in designing and developing the official website on the Second Biennial Meeting of States and published and disseminated a “Frequently Asked Questions” leaflet.
Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict
The Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict continues to draw attention to the impact of small arms and light weapons on children and to advocate action to redress the situation.
During the period under review, the Office prepared the fifth report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on children and armed conflict (see S/2005/72) and proposed a series of recommendations relating to the trafficking in small arms and light weapons, including, inter alia, that national commissions on small arms and light weapons should incorporate into their national plans of action public awareness campaigns on the protection of children in armed conflict, and that the work of the United Nations agencies that undertake data collection on the impact of small arms and light weapons on children in armed conflict, transitional and post-conflict situations should be supported.
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
The Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (the Firearms Protocol)5 entered into force on 3 July 2005.
The Firearms Protocol is the first instrument of global application dealing with firearms.
It sets out a comprehensive system to control the movement of firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, which includes provisions that require the criminalization of offences relating to the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, as well as to the tampering with firearms markings.
To facilitate its assistance activities to States in the ratification and implementation process, the Office on Drugs and Crime has developed a legislative guide for the Firearms Protocol,6 which identifies legislative requirements, issues arising from those requirements and options available to States in developing and drafting the necessary legislation.7
United Nations Children's Fund
Hundreds of thousands of child soldiers are currently serving in armed forces throughout the world.
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) programmes build capacity in the protection of children and the elimination of the use of children as soldiers.
UNICEF programmes on nutrition, education, psychological health, water and sanitation, landmines and protection in complex emergencies seek to mitigate the impact of conflict on children.
Consistent with the Programme of Action, UNICEF continued to advocate against the recruitment and use of child soldiers and was actively involved in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNICEF has supported the integration of small arms and light weapons awareness into the national school-based landmine risk education programme, its training for teachers and its peer education programmes.
UNICEF has also developed a peace and tolerance curriculum with the Ministry of Education in Côte d'Ivoire and supported training of trainers for 550 teachers, benefiting more than 750,000 children.
At the global level, UNICEF continued to contribute to the development of a system to monitor and report on egregious rights violations perpetrated against children in conflict-affected areas.
UNICEF also collaborated with partners in a landmark United Nations study on violence against children.
United Nations Development Programme
UNDP has continued to play a leading role in developing the capacity of States to manage weapons collection, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and violence-reduction initiatives.
UNDP has provided support to small arms and light weapons-related initiatives in more than 40 partner countries worldwide.
The experience and lessons learned from each successive project has enabled UNDP to refine its support strategies and programmatic focus to more accurately and effectively address the needs and realities of countries most affected by small arms-related violence.
Technical assistance has been provided to UNDP country projects in seven countries under the weapons collection, management and destruction programme.
Overall, the programme enabled the collection and destruction of 340,378 small arms and light weapons and 1,165 tons of ammunition and of another 49.6 million items such as cartridges (bullets).
Stockpile management assistance was provided for 340,378 weapons- and capacity-development activities providing training for 800 officials, mainly on small arms and light weapons and ammunition safety and security.
Under the programme framework, UNDP has subcontracted the development of a management information software called DREAM (disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and arms management), which was designed to serve partly as a tool for registration and stockpile management of national firearms.
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
The proliferation of small arms has a grave impact on the security of refugees and internally displaced persons and those who seek to assist them.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has worked alongside host States in ongoing efforts to prevent the proliferation of small arms in refugee communities and/or the infiltration of armed elements and combatants in those communities.
Such efforts included ensuring the location of camps well away from international borders and zones of conflict.
UNHCR also sought to strengthen partnership with organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop a capacity to identify, separate and disarm armed elements from refugees.
United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research
UNIDIR, in collaboration with the Emergency and Security Service of UNHCR, is profiling the issue of small arms as it impacts upon the lives of refugees, internally displaced persons and returnees.
A special issue of Refugees Magazine was produced for the Second Biennial Meeting of States.
UNIDIR is cooperating with other United Nations bodies and NGOs on interpersonal violence and small arms and has initiated projects with the Economic Commission for Europe to assist the commercial sector in increasing the security of the communities in which they operate.
UNIDIR, through its work in the Geneva Forum, co-organizes regular discussions among States, international organizations and NGOs to promote and monitor the implementation of the Programme of Action.
UNIDIR is carrying out a pilot project on the theme “European action on small arms, light weapons and explosive remnants of war”, and work has begun on a joint study with the South-Eastern Europe Clearinghouse for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons and the University of Bradford to undertake a study of the costs of destroying small arms and light weapons.
Using participatory monitoring and evaluation techniques, UNIDIR has identified key criteria for successful weapons collection.
The project studied the experiences of Albania, Cambodia and Mali and assisted work in Kenya, Sierra Leone and Somalia.
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
At the sixth High-Level Meeting between the United Nations and Regional and Other Intergovernmental Organizations, held in July 2005, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs presented a work plan for joint cooperation with regional organizations on the issue of protection of civilians in armed conflict.
United Nations Development Fund for Women
The United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) has continued its advocacy work for better inclusion of gender perspectives in United Nations activities related to small arms and light weapons.
In October 2004, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), UNIFEM launched a new publication entitled “Getting it right, doing it right: gender and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration”.
The publication contains two in-depth case studies, lessons learned, the recommendations that emanated from a desk review of United Nations disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes to date and a set of policy guidelines aimed at informing planning and programming through all stages of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration implementation.
UNIFEM has also informed the planning of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes in Haiti, the Sudan and the Great Lakes region and has contributed to the United Nations inter-agency working group on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.
Earlier, in August 2004, UNIFEM supported the Ndabaga Association of Women Ex-Combatants in Rwanda in holding their first membership-wide meeting, which resulted in increased support for the Association from the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission.
On the occasion of the Second Biennial Meeting of States, UNIFEM co-organized a panel entitled “Men, women and gun violence”, which brought together United Nations practitioners, academic researchers and civil society representatives to elaborate the utility of gender analysis for small arms control initiatives.
World Health Organization
The Armed Violence Prevention Programme of the World Health Organization (WHO) aims to strengthen national capacities and to promote coherent institutional synergies at international and regional levels on armed violence prevention.
The Programme represents an innovative collaboration that derives its strength from WHO experience in analysing armed violence and UNDP operational strengths in sectors relevant to violence prevention at the country level.
Phase I of the Programme builds on previous work of both WHO and UNDP in Brazil and El Salvador.
In that phase, the programme will identify and evaluate actions being undertaken to prevent armed violence.
That will contribute to the development of a database of evidence on effective ways to prevent armed violence, and will eventually enhance the capacity to develop strategies to reduce the demand for small arms.
Regional and subregional levels
During the period under review, regional and subregional organizations undertook numerous activities in the implementation of the Programme of Action.
For instance, the States parties signatories to the Nairobi Declaration and the Nairobi Protocol met in Nairobi on 20 and 21 June 2005 for the Third Ministerial Review Conference of the Nairobi Declaration8 on the Problem of the Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons in the Great Lakes Region and the Horn of Africa.
The Conference culminated with the adoption of The Best Practice Guidelines and Minimum Common Standards on Key Issues in the Implementation of the Nairobi Protocol; the signing of the Ministerial Declaration on Practical Implementation of Small Arms Action in the Great Lakes Region and the Horn of Africa; and the signing of the Agreement on the Establishment of a Regional Centre on Small Arms.
The signing of the above-mentioned Agreement transformed the Nairobi Secretariat into the Regional Centre on Small Arms and Light Weapons.9
In West Africa, national commissions from 15 member States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), along with members of civil society, met in March 2005 in Bamako to review a draft convention that would transform the current voluntary ECOWAS moratorium on the importation, exportation and manufacture of light weapons in West Africa into a legally binding treaty.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, through its Partnership for Peace Trust Fund programme and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council Ad Hoc Working Group on small arms and light weapons and mine action, continued to develop and implement activities in areas directly supporting the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action.
In September 2004, the Working Group revised its Trust Fund policy, with a view to providing Partnership for Peace Trust Fund Partners with new opportunities to serve as lead nations for specific projects, as well as to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cooperation with the Mediterranean Dialogue countries and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative.
NATO has also completed various antipersonnel landmine destruction projects in Albania, Republic of Moldova, Tajikistan and the Ukraine and the destruction of small arms and light weapons in Serbia and Montenegro.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Forum for Security Cooperation adopted two decisions designed to enhance the control of small arms and light weapons exports, decision 5/04 on standard elements for end-user certificates and verification procedures for small arms and light weapons exports, and decision 8/04, which sets forth OSCE principles on the control of brokering in small arms and light weapons.
Decision 8/04 is designed to stop the circumvention of sanctions adopted by the Security Council, as well as to minimize the risk of diversion of small arms and light weapons into illegal markets and reinforce their export control.
The Council of the European Union adopted a joint action in November 2004 to support ECOWAS in combating the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.
The European Union (EU) provided a contribution of 151,000 euros towards the setting up of the light weapons unit within the ECOWAS secretariat and supporting efforts to transform the ECOWAS moratorium into a legally binding instrument.10 In addition, in 2005, the EU concluded its weapons collection and destruction programmes in Albania, Cambodia and South-East Europe.
On 19 October 2004, the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies11 organized an outreach seminar in Vienna to raise awareness on the positive contribution that the Wassenaar Arrangement makes to responsible transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies and the importance of increasing its transparency.
At its 10th plenary meeting, held in Vienna on 8 and 9 December 2004, the Wassenaar Arrangement welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), which stipulates that participating States shall establish, develop and maintain appropriate and effective export and trans-shipment controls.
The fifth meeting of the Regional Steering Group for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons in South-Eastern Europe, which was held on the margins of the second regional small arms and light weapons seminar for national focal points and programme managers, held in Budva, Montenegro, on 13 and 14 October 2004, considered ways to enhance awareness of the problems and consequences of small arms and light weapons proliferation in the South-Eastern European region and to assess the implementation of the Stability Pact Regional Implementation Plan on small arms and light weapons, lessons learned on small arms control interventions and problems related to recovered and surplus small arms and light weapons and ammunition.12
C. National level
At the time of completion of the present report, the Department for Disarmament Affairs had received 100 national reports on the implementation of the Programme of Action.13
Conclusions
As can be noted from the information outlined above, continued efforts are being made to provide assistance to countries in need of addressing the proliferation of illicit weapons in their territories, as well as those in need of assistance in implementing the provisions of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Eradicate and Combat the Illicit Trade In Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.
Efforts at the regional level are also very encouraging, and there has been a noticeable improvement in the collaboration and cooperation of CASA members.
At the global level, the outcome of the Open-ended Working Group on Tracing constituted a significant step towards the realization of the commitments undertaken by States under the Programme of Action.
The politically binding international instrument agreed upon by the Working Group will provide States with an important tool to enhance cooperation in tracing the sources of leakage of small arms and light weapons into illicit trade.
The broad-based consultations on illicit brokering held by the Secretariat have highlighted once again the complex nature of the small arms challenge and the need to continuously develop the capacity of affected States to address its multiple facets.
It is hoped that the group of governmental experts to be established after the Review Conference to consider progress made in the implementation of the Programme of Action will help build the consensus necessary for enhanced international cooperation in preventing, combating and eradicating illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons.
The various initiatives undertaken by the United Nations departments, specialized agencies and funds, both individually and collectively, under the auspices of the CASA mechanism, testify to the fact that assistance to States and the development of capacity for the implementation of the Programme of Action have remained a central priority of the United Nations.
The initiatives carried out at the regional and subregional levels are encouraging and in many instances provide a basis for further action at the global level.
