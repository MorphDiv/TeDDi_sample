Note by the secretariat
Agenda item 6 (a): Report of the Commission for Africa fix line spacing
The Commission for Africa recently released its report, entitled “Our common interest”.
The report contains ten chapters, which are as follows:
The case for action; Lost decades: legacies and causes; Through African eyes: culture; Getting systems right: capacity-building; The need for peace and security; Leaving no one out: investing in people; Going for growth and poverty reduction; More trade and fairer trade; Where will the money come from?
: resources; Making it happen.
The report, in paragraphs 65- to 72, accords special attention to the water policy challenges in Africa and to the African Ministers' Council on Water.
The following are the highlights of the report:
It acknowledges that 2005 is the Second United Nations Water Decade and that there is a need for renewed commitment to water supply and sanitation; It recommends that, starting in 2005, donors must reverse the decline in aid for water supply and sanitation to enable African Governments to achieve the commitment of the Africa Water Vision to reduce by 75 per cent the proportion of people without access to safe water and sanitation; The G- 8 should report back by 2007 on implementation of the G-8 African Action Plan on Water agreed in 2003; Financing for the water sector forms part of the $10 billion infrastructure funding proposed in chapter 7.
The pledging conference to be held in Paris in March 2005 will provide an opportunity for donors to demonstrate their commitment to the sector; Funds and capacity to deliver are currently being spread across a variety of water initiatives, which increases transaction costs; The African Ministers' Council on Water is best placed to coordinate this and could formally report on progress to the Africa Partners Forum.
Agenda item 6 (b): Forthcoming summit of G- 8 countries (Scotland, United Kingdom, July 2005)
An extract of the relevant subsection of the report is attached.
