African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Introduction
The present report has been prepared pursuant to General Assembly resolution 59/158 of 20 December 2004.
It focuses on the activities, operations and funding of the African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders and provides an overview of the Institute's activities to raise awareness and promote adherence of member States to relevant international conventions, following an assessment of individual countries' needs and incorporation of appropriate measures into national action plans for crime prevention and criminal justice.
Available information shows that the African continent has a serious crime problem, including both violent crime and property crime, putting at great risk the security of persons, the quality of life and the enforcement of the law.
Recent studies indicate that Africa is also increasingly afflicted by transnational organized crime.
To combat that situation, there has been a steadily progressive effort by Governments together with other agencies at the subregional, regional and international levels to consolidate good practices.
The international community has started crucial initiatives, including the negotiation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (General Assembly resolution 55/25, annex I) and the Protocols thereto and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (resolution 58/4, annex).
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has been increasing its efforts to implement technical assistance projects in Africa and to widen its network in the region, including by the establishment of field offices on the continent.
There is an emerging consensus that high levels of crime constitute a major impediment to sustainable development, undercutting in particular prospects of achieving stable and economically viable societies that would bring benefits to all citizens.
Accordingly, strategies for social development necessarily have to address the crime problem.
On the other hand, global statistics on crime indicate that the level of crime in a society is inversely related to the level of social development.
Hence, the higher the level of development, the lesser the amount of crime, while the lower the level of development, as is the case in Africa, the higher the level of crime.
Combating crime requires a careful deployment of resources, establishing monitoring mechanisms and promoting the sustainability of systems that ensure observance of the law and existence of civil order.
Since there is a significant lack of such resources in Africa, the continent faces the unenviable situation of being ridden with violations of the law and facing an upsurge in crime levels as a result of inadequate investment in crime prevention.
While there is a noticeable rise in the level of political development, showing a growth in capacity to address matters of social development, the continent still experiences frequent upheavals arising from difficulties in the formation of States.
Intolerance of political dissent and divergent opinion is widespread, which gives rise to protracted internal civil disorders and social conflicts, which in turn are a recipe for anarchy and instability.
Such a situation facilitates the unabated growth of transnational organized crime.
Opportunities and resources for social programmes aimed at the eradication of disease and poverty are squandered and, as a consequence, institutional capacity is weakened and governmental authority undermined, making the region a transit zone for all forms of organized crime.
Despite the elusive and complex networks of criminal groups, their activities can be successfully curbed.
Africa is becoming more focused and better equipped to address issues related to conflict resolution; to new trends in crime, including trafficking in human beings and firearms, corruption, terrorism, drug abuse and cybercrime; and to the various threats to the rule of law arising from those types of crime.
UNODC, together with the African Union, other regional mechanisms and agencies and also the African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, representing the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network in the region, are increasing their initiatives to assist the continent in solving its problems caused by serious crime and underdevelopment.
During the period under review, the Institute continued to receive political support from its member States, its Governing Board, the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the Economic Commission for Africa, the African Union, the General Assembly and other interested parties, including the private and civil sectors.
The support and assistance received, including partnerships with donor Governments and agencies, have enabled the Institute to implement and participate in a number of crucial activities.
The Institute consolidated its cooperation with member States in order to develop joint programmes of action based on individual national requirements in the area of crime prevention, using the international legal instruments as an effective means to address the crime problem.
The Institute continued to operate against a background of financial difficulties arising from the lack of fulfilment of their financial obligations by many of its member States.
However, the growing awareness of the activities of the Institute among member States and other interested parties has improved perceptions of the Institute, which has in turn been reflected in the improved level of response to the Institute's call to countries to join in the implementation of programmes of mutual concern in the area of crime prevention.
It is hoped that the strategy of engaging the Institute's constituents individually in specific programmes and activities will ultimately translate into financial support and boost the capacity of the Institute to provide the mandated services.
Governance and management of the Institute
Governing Board
During the period under review, efforts have been undertaken to implement recommendations made by the Governing Board at its ninth session, held in Kampala on 21 and 22 June 2004.
On that occasion, the Board expressed its appreciation to the General Assembly for its continued support to the Institute, in particular for the United Nations grant, which is vital for sustaining the Institute.
The Governing Board also expressed satisfaction with the Institute's proposals for a sustained drive to gain crucial support from member States and others concerned and called for enhanced cooperation between member States and UNODC in that respect.
Member States were urged to meet their financial responsibility to the Institute and those States which had not yet acceded to the statute of the Institute were called upon to do so.
Following that recommendation and aiming to mobilize support, the Director of the Institute met with government authorities of Ethiopia, Mali, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and South Africa and held several meetings with envoys in Kampala.
South Africa has expressed interest in becoming a member State and the documentation requested by Pretoria has meanwhile been provided.
Similarly, Mali has indicated its intention to accede to the statute of the Institute.
The Chairman of the Governing Board also continued his intensive contacts with member States, reminding their Governments of their financial obligations.
As a result, a number of countries, including Tunisia and Uganda, have remitted their contributions.
The Chairman will continue to lead the mobilization drive.
The Institute was advised by the Governing Board to explore means of mobilizing further support for its programmes from non-traditional sources, such as the private sector.
Interest has been expressed by corporate entities in promoting crime prevention programmes that enhance their operations in the region and create the necessary environment to support their investments.
In that context, the Institute has approached the banking and manufacturing sectors in Kampala to start a pilot programme on cybercrime, involving the police, in particular the Criminal Investigation Department, and other specialized agencies of the Government of Uganda.
Such a programme could be replicated in other member States as a way to strengthen cooperation with the private sector.
Having reviewed the financial situation of the Institute, the Governing Board expressed concern about the persistently low level of inflow of financial remittances and proposed that, if necessary, a review of the need for the Institute be undertaken among member States to gauge their expectations, goals and capacity to sustain it.
The matter is expected to be discussed in detail during the tenth session of the Board.
The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has offered to host that session in Tripoli in 2005.
General direction and management
During the period under review, further efforts were made to improve the perception of the Institute on the part of member States and other concerned parties.
Proposals for joint execution of bilateral projects were processed and implemented, and pilot surveys were initiated with a sample of countries.
The pilot project entitled “From prison back home”, developed together with the Government of Uganda, was successfully conducted and is ready to be replicated in other countries.
At the same time, the Institute has developed new projects to be implemented jointly with the Government of Uganda.
A study on criminal victimization, implemented in partnership with the University of South Africa, has been concluded and disseminated and is now ready for follow-up.
A project for the translation of international instruments into local legislation and national action plans of member States has been started in Burkina Faso and Mali.
Owing to lack of funds, it has not yet begun in the United Republic of Tanzania.
The Institute worked to develop its network of partnerships with law enforcement authorities in the region and provided advisory services on emerging international crime-related issues and in support of law enforcement systems, which are often inadequate to cope with the current levels and sophistication of crime.
There is enhanced contact with the various law enforcement agencies in the region in the matter and a strategy to obtain crime statistics from police authorities in the region has been devised.
The Institute has an ongoing project to solicit data in Africa regarding law enforcement and the relevant crime statistics with a view to analysing the data to facilitate formulation of effective policies and strategies in crime prevention.
In that regard the Institute is maintaining close cooperation with police authorities in the region, including with the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), the Southern African Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization, the Eastern African Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization and the West African Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization.
As recommended by the Governing Board, substantial efforts have been made to visit various capitals and approach African delegations at regional and international meetings in order to mobilize resources and to assess the needs of the countries concerned as regards promoting stable and viable criminal justice systems and enhancing their ability to combat the growing threat of transnational organized crime through strengthened regional cooperation.
Visits were made to Accra, Kigali and Port Louis in the last quarter of 2004.
Owing to growing concern at the impact of transnational organized crime, contacts have been enhanced with African and other diplomatic missions in Addis Ababa and Kampala through visits for coordination, cooperation and consultation purposes with a view to improving prospects for strengthened support.
The Institute has been in contact with the missions of Ethiopia, Nigeria, Rwanda and the Sudan in Kampala and has discussed bilateral cooperation with those countries.
The Institute has also made efforts to liaise with the Group of African States at the United Nations in New York through increased cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kampala and the Permanent Mission of Uganda to the United Nations in New York.
Arrangements have been made to visit New York in September 2005 in order to mobilize support.
During the preparatory phase, documents and reports of activities by the Institute have been shared with the Group of African States through the Permanent Mission of Uganda to the United Nations and the Institute has discussed the modalities of the forthcoming visit with the Ambassador of Uganda to the United Nations.
The task of developing capacity and improving the ability of the Institute to offer the required services to its member States has been highlighted as a major means of reaching out to interested partners.
The recommendations of the job competence analysis exercise that was concluded in 2004 have been operationalized and the post of Research and Policy Development Adviser has been filled.
Consequently, in reaching out to interested partners, the Institute's packaging and formal approach to issues of crime prevention and criminal justice has been relevant and suitable to authorities of the region.
It has stressed the need to utilize local expertise, to make use of available resources and to take into consideration the socio-economic realities of each situation.
As a result, the Institute has been identified as a partner for several consultative missions at the African Union when sessions have been held for experts and other authorities, including African ministers concerned with crime and development.
Such events have included the Regional Ministerial Conference of French-speaking Countries of Africa for the Ratification and Implementation of the Universal Instruments against Terrorism and the Organized Crime Convention and the Convention against Corruption, held in Port Louis from 25 to 27 October 2004, and the Second African Union Ministerial Conference on Drug Control in Africa and the Meeting of Experts, held in Grand Bay, Mauritius, from 14 to 17 December 2004.
The Ministerial Conference called upon member States to increase their financial and technical assistance to the Institute and appealed to member States to strengthen capacities at the national and regional levels in order to address the problems of crime prevention and criminal justice within the context of their economic, social, cultural and political realities.
The African Expert Group Meeting on Crime and Drugs as Impediments to Security and Development in Africa: Strengthening the Rule of Law, held in Vienna on 3 and 4 May 2005, recommended that the capacity of the Institute be reinforced.
Moreover, at the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, held in Bangkok from 18 to 25 April 2005, the African Expert Group reaffirmed that the Institute should be the regional coordinating mechanism that should organize and coordinate, inter alia, specialized training programmes for African law enforcement officers.
The Government of Uganda continued to offer valuable assistance, guidance and political support to the Institute, in accordance with the host country agreement.
The government departments concerned have been instrumental in the implementation of pilot projects in the country as a starting point for their successful implementation on a wider scale in the region.
In addition to the Uganda Prison Service, the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Services has facilitated the work of the Institute in the implementation of the project on street children and juvenile delinquency, while the Ministry of Justice has helped in the development of a comprehensive packaging of strategies from justice, labour and social services departments to address problems of delinquency.
Substantive programmes and activities
Overview
The main focus of the activities of the Institute has been on the individual needs of member States and the growing awareness that new trends in crime are elusive, making effective crime prevention strategies essential as a necessary planning component in the process of sustainable socio-economic development.
Within its available means, the Institute has reached out to member States by conducting advisory missions with a view to identifying, studying and developing appropriate remedial action to address the crime problem.
In that context, missions have been undertaken to Abuja, Addis Ababa, Bamako, Cairo, Dar es Salaam and Ouagadougou and the Institute is now ensuring appropriate follow-up to those missions.
The Institute takes into consideration new developments within the region when developing new project proposals.
The Institute has thus approached the authorities in Kinshasa with a proposal to address human rights problems in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as it emerges from conflict and internal strife.
New initiatives are taken in close cooperation with other international organizations: contacts have been made with the World Intellectual Property Organization to develop cooperation in the implementation of joint activities to address violations of copyright in Africa.
Through the Interpol subregional bureau in Nairobi and the Eastern African Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization the Institute is making arrangements for increased inter-agency cooperation in crime prevention.
The Regional Ministerial Conference of French-speaking Countries of Africa for the Ratification and Implementation of the Universal Instruments against Terrorism and the Organized Crime Convention and the Convention against Corruption, organized jointly by UNODC, the Intergovernmental Agency of la Francophonie and the Government of Mauritius (see para.
16 above), requested the Institute to develop, in coordination with concerned intergovernmental organizations, training programmes for magistrates, police officers and other public servants to facilitate the implementation of the above instruments.
Pursuant to that recommendation, the Institute, in conjunction with the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, will shortly finalize a programme to address the need for training of African police corps in specialized fields.
Similarly, contacts are being made with the Botswana Police College to that end.
Partnerships are also fostered with other players, including the academic sector.
The Institute has entered into negotiations with the African Centre for Research and Legal Studies, a local non-governmental organization in Kampala, with a view to developing cooperation regarding implementation of all the outstanding project proposals.
Currently the Institute has project proposals awaiting funding on a variety of themes, including terrorism, trafficking in women and children and combating and eliminating kidnapping, that were developed as a result of a study undertaken by the Institute with a view to assessing the needs of its member States in crime prevention.
Project activities
During the period under review progress has been made with the development and/or implementation of the projects described below.
Development of regional instruments on extradition and mutual legal assistance
The Institute has continued to pursue its efforts to complete the final stages of the extradition and mutual legal assistance project.
Efforts have been made to arrange an expert/ministerial meeting to discuss the draft convention on mutual legal assistance for subsequent consideration by the Council of Ministers and the Summit of African Leaders of the African Union.
A number of countries, including Equatorial Guinea, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Uganda, have expressed an interest in hosting the meeting.
The Institute is at decisive stages of discussion with the relevant authorities of the African Union regarding the final approval of the regional instruments.
The Institute has been approached with a proposal to engage a local consultant to update the drafts with the aim of making them more comprehensive by addressing current concerns regarding operational issues and applicability.
Arrangements have been made to hire such a consultant.
Meanwhile, the draft convention on extradition has been finalized and is ready for submission to the Summit of African Heads of State for adoption.
However, because the two issues of extradition and mutual legal assistance are closely interrelated, the African Union advised that both conventions should be presented together for consideration by the Summit, scheduled for 2006.
Study on effective cooperation between the Institute and its partners
The Institute has carried out a study on effective cooperation between it and its partners in order to identify prospects for cooperation with the non-traditional sector, the private sector and the civil society organizations and to determine appropriate areas of intervention and has thus gained capacity to gauge its potential contribution to crime prevention efforts of key players in the region.
The Institute has also launched a study to identify a sustainable flow of resources to support and boost its capacity to implement programmes of mutual interest with its partners.
A number of contacts have been formalized with academic, civil, private and human rights organizations.
Collaboration has been initiated with the International Centre for Higher Applied Studies (CIESA), Canada, concerning the exchange of relevant programmes for human resource development in law and prison management.
The Institute is developing a proposal for joint collaboration with the University of Ghana and the Legon Centre for International Affairs.
Cooperation with the faculties of social sciences and law of Makerere University in Kampala and the Foundation for Human Rights Initiative in Kampala is being enhanced with a view to establishing sustainable programmes for joint implementation of projects concerning the maintenance of the rule of law and human rights.28.
The Institute is consolidating its continued cooperation with the mass media in a partnership focused on strengthening publicity to as many partners as possible.
A number of countries and organizations have called for an increased flow of information and services from the Institute to their capitals.
The development of partnerships at the local and regional levels will address those requests.
United Nations survey on kidnapping
The Institute has undertaken a study on kidnapping in Africa on behalf of the United Nations in fulfilment of its role as a member of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network and in order to foster closer cooperation among and provision of technical support to members of the network.
The finalization of the study has been delayed by communication problems in the region.
However, alternative avenues are being worked out, such as direct links with the focal points and a strengthened relationship with inspectors general of police, directors of public prosecution, commissioners of prisons and partners in the civil organizations in several countries, to overcome the problems encountered.
Survey of the research interests of member States
The Institute's survey of the research interests of member States has revealed the concern of African countries as regards the growing threat of transnational organized crime and terrorism.
The study has provided a firm basis for continuous dialogue with member States and other partners on crime issues.
The Institute continues to raise the awareness of countries of the region and to receive requests on how to combat transnational organized crime and terrorism, including provision of technical assistance by the Institute in incorporating the international instruments into national legislation and enhanced cooperation at various levels among the organs of state security.
Mali has benefited from such assistance.
Subject to the availability of funds, it is planned to extend assistance also to Benin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.
The rapid rise in cases of new types of crime, such as cybercrime, has also become an issue of concern in the region for which requests for technical assistance by African countries have been received.
Workshop on effective and sustainable strategies in crime prevention
The workshop on effective and sustainable strategies in crime prevention was the first in a series of activities aimed to encourage member States in Africa to implement the United Nations instruments on crime prevention and criminal justice.
It stressed the need for advisory meetings to be held at various levels to raise the awareness and interest of countries, as well as to give them an opportunity to ensure that their concerns are ultimately reflected in the implementation of the international instruments.
While offering technical assistance to its member States in order to incorporate the provisions of the international instruments into local legislation and national action plans, the Institute takes into consideration the socio-economic realities of the countries concerned and the specific needs of the region.
This strategy was designed by the Institute to reach every member State, either individually or as a group at the subregional level, with a view to developing a culture of uniform application of international legal provisions to meet specific local and regional challenges.
Project on trafficking in women and children
The project on trafficking in women and children was another activity intended to assist member States of the Institute in implementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and, in particular, its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (General Assembly resolution 55/25, annex II).
Member States are encouraged to strengthen law enforcement cooperation and information exchange on the nature of this form of organized crime.
Trafficking in women and children is one of the most vicious forms of crime, controlled by a rapidly growing and highly organized criminal network that is already operating in several countries of the region with near impunity.
The Institute provided technical assistance to Uganda in an effort to translate the Convention into its national action plan and such advisory services will be replicated in other countries when funds become available.
In cooperation with UNODC, the Institute is exploring the possibility of carrying out a study in the region, the findings of which would be disseminated throughout the region by means of seminars or workshops.
A request for technical assistance from the Democratic Republic of Congo has not been responded to owing to lack of funding.
However, contacts have been initiated with the governmental authorities and other concerned partners in Kinshasa to take action as soon as possible.
Several other countries and civil society organizations have also expressed interest in the project.
Social work in prisons
In cooperation with the Uganda Prison Service, the Institute developed and organized a six-week induction course for welfare and rehabilitation officers.
The contribution of the Institute concerned social work in prisons as a key intervention leading to the successful social rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners in their communities, an issue that has since gained prominence in the operations of the Uganda Prison Service.
The project arose out of the concern of the penitentiary authorities about the increased level of recidivism, which was taken as an indication that the rehabilitation of prisoners was unsatisfactory.
The project highlights a number of factors that are essential in addressing the process of social rehabilitation of prisoners and subsequent reintegration of the prisoners into their communities utilizing locally available resources and emphasizing the acknowledgement of socio-economic realities, which was shown to be key in the implementation of crime prevention strategies.
The evaluation exercise that was held recently at the Institute lead to the recommendation that the course also be provided in other countries.
Appreciation was expressed of the methodology used.
The Institute intends to offer the course to other member States, such as Mozambique, where the pilot project has been studied by the responsible authorities.
The Institute will meet with several envoys in Addis Ababa and Kampala and with the Group of African States in New York to promote the project.
Country profile project
In order to help countries effectively combat crime and share good practices among themselves, the Institute has developed a project to establish a database on criminal statistics.
It has prepared and is currently testing a questionnaire to collect criminal statistics covering a period of five years, highlighting action taken and the trends observed (decrease or increase) for a sample of countries.
The instrument covers three categories of crimes: crimes against the person, crimes against property and types of (transnational) organized crime.
The research component of the study will include an analysis of how national organized crime and transnational organized crime are related with a view to designing policies to effectively combat those forms of crime.
The secretariat is finalizing the translation of the questionnaire to enable wider applicability in the region and comprehensive compilation of the data.
Illegal migration
At the request of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the secretariat is devising a project to assist in controlling illegal immigration into that country.
The project will include the following components: research (data collection and analysis) and reporting, as well as the organization of an expert meeting to draft a programme of action that will be discussed with the concerned countries of emigration.
Based on the conclusions of the study, the meeting will look into practical measures to be taken by the countries of emigration in the region to reduce the phenomenon.
The draft proposal will be discussed with the requesting country and the concerned countries of emigration.
The international training programme on peacebuilding and good governance for African civilian personnel and correctional officers involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations
The international training programme on peacebuilding and good governance for African civilian personnel, organized by the University of Ghana in Accra in 2004, adopted the Institute's proposals to introduce a course on social rehabilitation and social reintegration of internally displaced persons for officers in charge of refugees and internally displaced persons in camps and also for correctional officers involved in United Nations peacebuilding and peacekeeping operations.
The Institute conducted the course also, mutatis mutandis, for other correctional officers, who rated it as very valuable for their operations.
Accordingly, arrangements are being made with the organizers to offer future training also to correctional officers.
International cooperation and partnerships
The Institute has maintained close cooperation with UNODC.
As a member of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network, it has continued to participate in the activities of the network and been an effective mechanism for the implementation of United Nations crime prevention programmes in the Africa region.
The Institute has also maintained close cooperation with the African Union, in particular its Social Affairs Department.
It has consequently been identified as a partner in the implementation of all activities by the Union regarding crime prevention.
This relationship is developing into a strong bilateral arrangement between the Institute, as a regional mechanism for collaboration of efforts in crime prevention and criminal justice, and the Union.
In the Strategic Plan of the Institute, the need for coordination of regional efforts in crime prevention through regional cooperation is emphasized.
The challenges of crime prevention require the intervention of several agencies in a multilateral approach.
It therefore becomes a necessary tool for the Institute to belong to a network of international crime prevention agencies.
It therefore participated in the Ministerial Conference of Ministers of the Interior of members of the African Union, organized by the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in Tripoli on 17 and 18 June 2005, and promoted the strengthening of regional mechanisms in the fight against transnational organized crime.
The Institute continued its participation in various meetings and conferences at the subregional, regional and international levels during which the prospects for cooperation and new partnerships in the fight against crime were explored.
At the Fifteenth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Africa, held in Ouagadougou from 29 March to 1 April 2005, the Institute made useful contacts with various authorities for the development and implementation of bilateral and regional proposals.
Funding and support
The total resources of the Institute for 2004 amounted to $402,192.83, consisting of: (a) assessed contributions of member States ($75,344.49); (b) the United Nations grant portion for 2004 ($272,556.30) (the total amount of the grant for the biennium 2004-2005 amounted to $380,300); and (c) other income received from rental of the Institute premises and facilities and interest on deposits ($54,292.04).
For the period January-June 2005, the total resources of the Institute amounted to $227,622.83, consisting of: (a) assessed contributions from member States ($75,558); (b) the 2005 portion of the United Nations grant ($107,743.70) (the approved allotment for 2004-2005 is $380,300, less the amount spent in 2004, $272,556.30); (c) other income received from the rental of Institute premises and interest on deposits from January to June 2005 ($44,321.13).
Assessed financial contributions of member States
The Governments of the Gambia, Senegal, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania paid their assessed contributions and arrears during the period January-December 2004, amounting to $75,344.
As at 31 December 2004, out of the total assessed contributions of $3,857,216.60 for the period 1989-2004, only $1,086,910.44 had been received, leaving an outstanding balance of $2,770,306.16.
For the period January-June 2005, a total of $75,558 was received from the following member States: Tunisia ($68,882) and Uganda ($6,676).
As indicated in the 2004 report (A/59/175, para.
31), the Institute was expected to receive $524,900 from its member States during the biennium 2004-2005.
However, only $150,902 has so far been collected.
Consequently, the Chairman of the Institute's Governing Board made an appeal to member States to honour their obligations.
It is still hoped that member States will respond favourably to the Chairman's appeal and settle all or part of their obligations before the end of 2005.
United Nations grant
The United Nations grant to the Institute was initially approved for the biennium 1992-1993 by the General Assembly in its resolution 46/153 of 18 December 1991.
The grant in the amount of $204,800 was to cover the costs of the posts of Director and Deputy Director and part of the administrative costs of the Institute.
Since then, the grant has continued to be included in the regular budget of the United Nations for subsequent bienniums in the same amount, including in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001.
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 54/130 of 17 December 1999, additional resources of $175,500 to finance three core Professional posts (Training Adviser, Research Adviser and Information/Documentation Adviser) were included in the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, bringing the total amount of the United Nations grant to the Institute to $380,300.
In accordance with established practice, the grant, considered a temporary measure, has not been recosted to reflect the impact of inflation and currency fluctuations.
In view of this, the statement in the previous report (A/59/175, para.
33) that the grant had been increased to $447,900 (after adjustment for inflation) occurred through an inadvertent error.
The United Nations grant to the Institute was continued in the biennium 2004-2005 in the amount of $380,300.
As at 31 December 2004, $272,556 had been spent on salaries of core Professional staff of the Institute (Director, Deputy Director, Training and Human Resource Development Adviser, Information/Documentation Adviser and Administrative/Finance Officer) leaving an outstanding balance of $107,744 for 2005.
C. Other sources of income
During the period January-December 2004, the Institute generated income amounting to $54,292.04 from rental of its facilities.
For the period January-June 2005, $44,321.13 has so far been received.
The future of the African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders: strategies for sustaining the Institute
In its resolution 59/158, the General Assembly commended the Institute for its efforts to promote and coordinate regional technical cooperation activities related to crime prevention and criminal justice in Africa, although the Institute's financial situation had greatly affected its capacity to deliver services to member States more effectively and comprehensively.
The Assembly also commended the Secretary-General for his efforts to mobilize the financial resources necessary to provide the Institute with the core Professional staff required to enable it to function effectively in the fulfilment of its mandated obligations; reiterated the need to strengthen further the capacity of the Institute to support national mechanisms for crime prevention and criminal justice in African countries; urged the States members of the Institute to make every possible effort to meet their obligations to the Institute; called upon all Member States and non-governmental organizations to adopt concrete practical measures to support the Institute in the development of the requisite capacity and to implement its programmes and activities aimed at strengthening crime prevention and criminal justice systems in Africa; and requested the Secretary-General to intensify efforts to mobilize all relevant entities of the United Nations system to provide the necessary financial and technical support to the Institute to enable it to fulfil its mandate.
Pursuant to resolution 59/158, arrangements have been put in place to implement a mobilization programme that covers all member States directly or through their missions.
As recommended by the Governing Board at its ninth session, the Chairman has intensified contacts with the relevant authorities in member States.
Coordination visits to the missions of member States provide opportunities to enhance dialogue and to discuss how best to address the needs of members with the meagre resources available, in an effort to attract more financial support.
The future of the Institute depends for the most part on support from its member States.
Such support will demonstrate the need for the Institute by the owners themselves, who in view of their economic difficulties are often prevented from effectively supporting their Institute financially.
Such support will definitely encourage the major partners at the United Nations and the donor community in general to support the Institute financially.
The need for a broad network of partnerships with other organizations and institutions, in particular also with the private sector, is to be stressed.
The recognition that crime is a major impediment to effective operations and to an environment conducive to attracting investment has raised the interest of the private sector in forming partnerships with crime prevention authorities.
The Institute should use the opportunity provided to better engage the private sector in its programmes and activities.
It should also reach out to the private sector with technical and professional expertise.
The efforts initiated by the Institute to develop cooperation with the local manufacturers' association, the banking industry and the office of the African Development Bank in Kampala should be expanded.
Civil society organizations also form a reliable partnership in pursuit of common objectives, including the mobilization of financial support.
The Institute has increasingly been recognized by its partners as a source of technical and professional expertise in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and as a regional mechanism at the disposal of its member States for coordination and harmonization of legislation and policy.
Its role has become even more relevant with the emergence of new types of criminality that individual countries cannot successfully control on their own.
The Institute is eager to strengthen its position as a crime prevention agency and medium for regional cooperation.
Partnerships in this area need to be enhanced with the African Union and all regional mechanisms, such as the East African Community, the Economic Community of West African States and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.
The Institute's relationship with the African Union is progressing well and mutual cooperation in this regard is developing into stronger ties based on the technical capacity of the Institute in issues related to crime and development in the region.
It is hoped that this relationship will be a viable mechanism for the Institute to sustain its capacity to implement its mandate.
The Institute will also continue to strengthen contacts with the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme and UNODC.
Conclusions and recommendations
The concerted efforts of the Governing Board, the Institute's partners and the continued support given to the Institute by the General Assembly in various resolutions, most recently resolution 59/158, have enabled the Institute to adopt a more focused and pragmatic approach to its future development.
The strategic framework outlined below will be followed to further strengthen the Institute's capacity to fulfil its mandate.
Focus on priority issues
The Institute will continue to focus its substantive programme of work on specific projects and activities in areas where it has a technical and comparative advantage in the African region.
In view of the role played by crime as an obstacle to sustained and sustainable social and economic development, the international community is constantly searching for new partnerships and the consolidation of existing ones in pursuit of sustained remedial action against transnational organized crime, including terrorism.
The Institute will strive to pursue that objective through specific crime prevention programmes.
In that respect, the Institute will continue to develop new strategies for intervention in places that have been destabilized by the effects of civil and armed conflict, such as the camps for internally displaced persons on the continent.
The Institute will also continue its advocacy efforts to encourage development agencies working in the region to incorporate crime prevention and criminal justice concerns into their development cooperation programmes in view of the threat posed by crime to sustainable development and will explore possibilities for joint activities aimed at effective implementation of development programmes in Africa.
Communication with member States
The Institute will maintain a continuous dialogue with its member States at the highest level of decision-making (heads of Government and ministers of foreign affairs, justice, the interior and health) to mobilize political and material support for its programmes.
Further measures are being actively considered vis-à-vis member States of the Institute that consistently fail to meet their financial obligations and new initiatives are being explored to deal with long-standing arrears of assessed contributions.
The Institute will continue to inform its member States about its technical competence and expertise and about its mandated services.
In that connection, the following initiatives will be pursued:
(a) Regular missions to African capitals in an effort to enhance communication;
(b) Consultative missions to assess the specific needs of member States in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice;
(c) Provision of technical assistance based on the priorities of countries in the region.
C. Partnerships
The Institute will further develop partnerships with the private sector and with non-governmental organizations, including strong links with other agencies for research purposes and for the regional dissemination of information regarding best practices in crime prevention and criminal justice reform.
The Institute will also act as a focal point in the region for all issues related to crime prevention and criminal justice.
In that context, the Institute will continue to cooperate closely with UNODC and the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network, as well as with other international bodies, such as the African Union, the Economic Commission for Africa, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme, with a view to mobilizing support through joint programmes addressing new trends in and forms of crime.
The Institute also sincerely hopes for continued support from the General Assembly.
If the Institute can count on a sound and reliable financial base, securing the funding of its core Professional staff, it can be more attuned to attracting technical cooperation and working partnerships with other donor agencies.
Marketing
The Institute will continue to develop and implement a vigorous marketing strategy through both the electronic and print media, including the updating of its website.
Measures will be adopted to inform and involve public authorities, including the police and other actors in the criminal justice systems, of the States in the region.
Efforts will also be made to raise awareness of the issues of crime and criminal justice dealt with by the Institute, through, inter alia, a special alliance with the media and the press.
