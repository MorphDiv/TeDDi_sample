Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency
Note by the Secretary-General**
The forty-ninth report of the International Atomic Energy Agency, for the calendar year 2004 (GC(49)/5), is submitted herewith to the General Assembly.
Major developments since this report was published will be covered by the annual statement of the Director General of the Agency to the General Assembly.
The report has been transmitted in accordance with the provisions of article III, paragraph 1 (a), of the Agreement governing the relationship between the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (General Assembly resolution 1145 (XII), annex).
As only a limited number of copies of the report are available, it has not been possible to make a full distribution.
Delegations are therefore requested to have the copies transmitted to them available during discussion of this item.
