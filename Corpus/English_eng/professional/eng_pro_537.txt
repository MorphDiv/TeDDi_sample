In its resolution 58/32 of 8 December 2003, entitled “Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security”, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to consider existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security and possible cooperative measures to address them.
The Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to conduct a study of relevant international concepts aimed at strengthening the security of global information and telecommunication systems, with the assistance of a group of governmental experts, appointed by him on the basis of equitable geographical distribution, and to submit a report on the outcome of the study to the Assembly at its sixtieth session.

In accordance with the terms of the resolution, the Secretary-General appointed a group of governmental experts from 15 States: Belarus, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Jordan, Malaysia, Mali, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, South Africa, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.
The list of experts is contained in the annex.
The Group of Governmental Experts met in three sessions, the first from 12 to 16 July 2004 at United Nations Headquarters, the second from 28 March to 1 April 2005 in Geneva, and the third from 11 to 22 July 2005 at United Nations Headquarters.
At its first session, the Group unanimously elected Andrey V. Krutskikh of the Russian Federation as its Chairman.

In accordance with its mandate as contained in resolution 58/32, the Group had a comprehensive, in-depth exchange of views on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security.
