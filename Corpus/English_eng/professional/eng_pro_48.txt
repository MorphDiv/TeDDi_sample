African Ministers'' Council on Water

Agenda item )
_______________________Introductory remarks by the President of the African Ministers'' Council on Water
Note to the secretariat
Summary
The introductory remarks provide an overview of the major developments that have taken place since the fifth session of the African Ministers' Council on WaterCOW, held in Entebbe, Uganda, in November in 2004.
These developments have direct and indirect implications for the work of the African Ministers' Council on Water, hence the need for the Council's Executive Committee and the Technical Advisory Committee of the African Ministers' Council on Water to reflect on their implications for our work.
In an indicative manner, my introductory remarks point to the key points and issues which should be central to our interactive discussions during the meeting of the Executive Committee.
Introductory remarks by the President of the African Ministers'' Council on Water
Excellencies, members of the Executive Committee, representative of the African Union, ladies and gentlemen,:
Let me begin by renewing my gratitude and appreciation to you all for having graciously elected Uganda to the post of President of the African Ministers'' Council on Water at our fifth session which my Government had the honour of hosting in November 2004.
Our eight-month journey from Entebbe in November 2004 to Addis Ababa in June 2005 has been characterized by a number of significant regional and global developments with significant implications for the African Ministers'' Council on Water In our region, the African Union has been engaged in consultations with African ministerial bodies on the issue of the integration of regional institutions, such as ours, into the governance structure of the African Union A number of developments have brought us much closer to the efforts being spearheaded by the New Partnership for Africa''s Development (NEPAD) Consultations with regional economic communities and river and lake basin organizations will take place, under the auspices of the African Ministers'' Council on Water, in this very building on 30 June.
The proposal is to broaden the ownership of the African Ministers'' Council on Water and to mobilize the major and relevant institutions of Africa in pursuit of the Council's mission of the African Ministers' Council on Water
At the global level, the international community, during the period following the fifth session, has been preoccupied with the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, particularly in the context of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Millennium Development Goals.
The Commission on Sustainable Development, at its thirteenth session in New York in April 2005, took stock of the progress made or needed and, on that basis, recommended a set of policy options aimed at expediting the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals The United Nations has also begun preparations and for the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the five-year review of the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, to be held in New York in September 2005.
The high-level plenary meeting will be attended by African hHeads of State and Government.
The Commission for Africa has issued its report, which accords prominent attention to the African Ministers'' Council on Water and also to the critical water policy challenges which we identified in Addis Ababa in December 2003 at our Pan-African Implementation and Partnership Conference.

These included the items outlined in the following sections.
2005-2007 work programme of the African Ministers' Council on Water
Work Programme -
The Council's W-2007 work programme' was adopted by the Council at its fifth session (Entebbe, Uganda, November 2004) It outlined the mid-term programme for the Council.
In response to our request, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) submitted on our behalf a proposal to the EU Water Facility for financial support for the implementation of the Work Programme (a copy of the proposal is available).
Trust fund
At its fifth session, the African Ministers'' Council on Water adopted a decision to request UNEP to host a trust fund of the African Ministers'' Council on Water and manage it on behalf of the Council.
The Trust Fund has now been established with an initial contribution of $100,000 from UNEP.
The President of the African Ministers'' Council on Water has also written to the major development cooperation partners:
To bring to their attention the establishment of the Trust Fund; To provide banking details for contributions to the fund; To invite partners to make contributions to the fund.
The President also held a number of bilateral consultations with some donor countries, including Germany and Denmark, both of whom have provided positive indications.
Necessary follow-up is being undertaken.
African Water Facility
The African Development Bank has successfully taken the necessary measures to make the African Water Facility operational These measures include the recruitment of a director for the facility as well as the associated staff.
The Governing Council of the Facility has also been properly constituted with the designation of representatives by all parties concerned (the Executive Committee of the African Ministers'' Council on Water, donor countries, NEPAD and UN- Water-/Africa).
The report of the inaugural meeting that took place on 28 June is available and will be introduced by the Director of the facility.
Hosting agreement for the secretariat of the African Ministers'' Council on Water
It will be recalled that, at its fifth session, the African Ministers'' Council on Water requested the Government of Nigeria to submit within six months a formal request for hosting the secretariat of the 'Council in Abuja.
The Government of Nigeria has fully complied with our request and the proposal (in English and French) has been circulated.
The Council's Technical Advisory Committee has formulated the necessary recommendations for our consideration
Rules of procedure
At its fifth session, the African Ministers'' Council on Water formally adopted its rules of procedure.
Governments were requested formally to confirm their endorsement.
These rules of procedure will be applied in the governance and operations of the African Ministers'' Council on Water
Communication strategy
A number of steps have been taken by the President to improve communication among the members of the African Ministers'' Council on Water and also to maintain effective collaboration with our partners.
The President initiated the launch of quarterly progress reports in the form of a letter to ministers, highlighting the activities and decisions aimed at implementing the outcomes of the fifth session of the Council The first issue from the President to ministers was distributed in March 2005.
Efforts are also being made to update the directory of members and partners of the African Ministers'' Council on Water.
The directory is an important tool for communication with the membership.
More work is still needed to make it more comprehensive and up-to-date.
With the assistance of German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and UNEP, terms of reference have been prepared for a consultancy on recommendations for the information technology required to improve the communication systems of the African Ministers'' Council on Water This work is in progress.
The website of the African Ministers'' Council on Water became operational on 13 June 2005.
The corporate profile of the African Ministers'' Council on Water will be of particular interest to members.
It has now been published and distributed and provides an overview of the mandate, structure and activities of the Council.
It will be particularly useful for raising awareness of and commitment to the Council.
Report of the Commission for Africa
As all are no doubt aware, the report of the Commission for Africa (Blair Commission) was recently released.
Further information on the work of Commission is available on the internet (www.commissionforafrica.org).
You will note in the report that paragraphs -72, on pages and 200, refer to subjects relating to water supply and sanitation in Africa and the role of the African Ministers'' Council on Water in coordinating water initiatives in the region.

Relationship between the African Ministers'' Council on Water and the African Union
In conformity with the Constitutive Act of the African Union, relationships between African ministerial bodies and the African Union have become the subject of consultations, with a view to establishing the best options for integration of these bodies into the Union.
The African Union recently held discussions with the Bureau of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN).
The African Union will also be holding discussions with the leadership of the African Ministers'' Council on Water as a follow-up to our initial contacts.
It will be recalled that the Sirte Declaration included an agreement to “request the Chair of the African Union Commission to adopt the mandate, structures and activities of AMCOW, AMCEN and the African Ministerial Conference on Agriculture in order to integrate them into the activities of the African Union Commission and its Specialized Technical Committees.” The Technical Advisory Committee of the African Ministers'' Council on Water has prepared a paper which draws our attention to the key issues that we should take into account.
Strengthening coordination with regional economic communities and river and lake basin organizations
Full cooperation of the regional economic communities and river and lake basin organizations in Africa is considered vital.
In order to harness to the maximum this huge reservoir of potential for attainment of the development goals to the maximum, a coordination meeting will be held here tomorrow.
The Technical Advisory Committee of the African Ministers'' Council on Water has made specific recommendations for our consideration.
Outcomes of the ministerial meeting on the Millennium Development Goals
