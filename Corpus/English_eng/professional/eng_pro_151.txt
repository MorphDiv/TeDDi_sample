Introduction
The Force and Sector 2 headquarters of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) have been established in the capital city of Nicosia, with Sectors 1 and 4 headquarters based at Skouriotissa and Famagusta, respectively.
In late 2004, owing to the dilapidated state of the Ledra Palace Hotel in Nicosia and Camp San Martin (Sector 1 headquarters) where the mission's military personnel are accommodated, and increasing safety concerns, UNFICYP commissioned an independent engineering survey to determine the suitability of these facilities for the accommodation of the mission's civilian police and military personnel.
The survey confirmed that the facilities are structurally unsafe and that their continuing utilization constitutes an unacceptable safety risk.
Given the prohibitive cost of refurbishing these facilities (approximately $20.2 million), UNFICYP would relocate all personnel currently accommodated at the Ledra Palace Hotel and Camp San Martin to containerized facilities at a total cost of $3,762,200, of which $709,500 would be required for the engagement of engineering consultancy services, site preparation, as well as electrical, water and sewage projects to be implemented during the 2004/05 financial period.
The balance of the estimated total cost of the project ($3,762,200) in the amount of $3,052,700 represents requirements under “facilities and infrastructure” for the acquisition of prefabricated facilities during the 2005/06 financial period for which no provision has been made in the proposed 2005/06 budget for UNFICYP dated 22 December 2004 (A/59/656).
Taking into account additional resource requirements of UNFICYP in connection with the emergency relocation of military personnel from the Ledra Palace Hotel and Camp San Martin, the proposed 2005/06 budgetary provisions for the maintenance of the Force will amount to $47,399,300 gross ($45,262,100 net), representing an increase of $3,052,700 gross and net compared to the proposed 2005/06 budget (A/59/656) for UNFICYP in the amount of $44,346,600 gross ($42,209,400 net), exclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions of $1,431,200.
Actions to be taken by the General Assembly
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the Force are:
(a) To appropriate an additional amount of $3,052,700 for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, including an amount of $1,017,566 to be funded through voluntary contributions from the Government of Cyprus;
(b) To assess the amount of $2,035,134, representing the balance of the additional appropriation, at a monthly rate of $169,594.
