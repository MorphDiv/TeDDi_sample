Annex to the letter dated 2 June 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Malaysia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
Putrajaya, Malaysia, 7 to 10 May 2005
We, the Ministers and other Heads of Delegation from Member Countries of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) met in Putrajaya, Malaysia, from 9 to 10 May 2005, to discuss issues faced by women in the era of globalization recognise that the participation of women and the integration of their perspectives, in all sectors and at all levels, are essential to their empowerment and to the achievement of gender equality and equity.
In conformity with the principles and obligations of NAM Members, we hereby:
Reaffirm our determination to preserve the noble ideals and principles of the Movement as initiated by its founders so as to further consolidate and make the Movement as the leading force in the 21st Century;
Recall that the Heads of State and Government of NAM Member Countries called upon States which are not parties to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women to work actively towards ratification of or accession to it and encourage all members to consider signing, ratifying or acceding to the Optional Protocol to the Convention;
Recognise the need for full and accelerated implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by States parties to the Convention;
Reaffirm also that the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled “Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century” are important contributions to the advancement of women worldwide and for achieving gender equality;
Welcome the Declaration adopted by the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-ninth session;
Acknowledge the progress made in addressing issues of concern with regard to women and mindful of the gaps, challenges and obstacles which remain in our efforts to empower women and in achieving gender equality;
Recognise that international cooperation, including South-South Cooperation, and partnership in the context of the Movement's comparative advantage based on the principle of common values in diversity, is the most effective way of working towards women's empowerment and gender equality and equity;
Recognise further the importance of expanding and accelerating NAM's efforts in enhancing the empowerment of women and the need to harmonize these efforts with the commitments made at all related major UN Conferences and Summits as well as the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration;
Recognise the persistent problems and challenges faced by women and girls and hereby resolve to empower them by taking actions in the following areas:
Women, Poverty and Economic Development
Continued marginalisation of the developing countries from the benefits of globalization, persistent income and economic gaps between the developed and developing countries, barriers faced by developing countries to markets, capital and technology, widening gap between the developed and developing countries, especially the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and aggravation of the problems deriving from poverty and social injustices have particularly adverse impact on women.
Increasing globalisation and trade liberalization have multiple impacts on the capacity of developing countries to create employment, livelihood opportunities and to achieve poverty eradication goals.
Whilst women have enjoyed some benefits, most of them still suffer from increased poverty, deteriorating working conditions and job insecurity.
Structural adjustment programmes, the increasing debt burden faced by the most indebted developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, is unsustainable and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress, sustainable development and poverty eradication strategies, that particularly affect women and girls.
Women's empowerment, their active participation and direct involvement in the economic sphere are critical to the achievement of sustainable development and poverty eradication in the Member Countries of the Non-Aligned Movement.
Creating an environment which empowers women to achieve upward mobility in the economic sphere in both the formal and informal sectors is an essential part of the national agenda.
In this regard, the role of the family unit that respects the human rights of all its members as an institution that provides the highest degree of material and moral well being is extremely important as stated in the Doha Declaration on Family adopted on 30 November 2004.
We hereby commit ourselves to:
a) Integrate women's interests and concerns into national economic policies and reforms on a basis of equality with men taking into consideration the effect of global economic trends;
b) Strengthen the role of public sector in ensuring and providing comprehensive health services to women as well as education and social security services to enable their full integration into economic activities;
c) Enhance the gender-analytic capacity of economists at all levels and in all institutions;
d) Develop and institutionalize gender-responsive budgets, monitor gender budget analysis and the utilization of these gender budgets;
e) Ensure that women's contribution in the unpaid and informal sector is quantified and duly included in the national accounting systems;
f) Develop and enforce policies that recognise and value the contribution of women in the economy that would increase their productivity and economic and social security;
g) Involve women actively in the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of macroeconomic policies, strategies and programmes;
h) Develop programmes to increase women's productive capacity which includes accessibility to technology related knowledge and skills;
i) Promote research on the impacts of globalisation and trade liberalization on women's economic status to develop better understanding and mainstreaming of women's issues in decision-making processes;
j) Formulate strategies to effectively address circumstances causing negative impacts of globalization on the situation of women and girls worldwide;
k) Provide women, especially marginalised and vulnerable categories of women, access to financing in particular micro-credit and marketing facilities and provide corresponding capacity-building programmes in gender awareness, fund management, and other appropriate skills;
l) Provide an enabling environment that removes gender specific barriers and creates opportunities for women's entrepreneurial development;
m) Strengthen the incentive role of the public sector as employer to develop an environment that effectively affirms and empowers women;
Include gender perspectives in finance and trade negotiations at all levels;
o) Strengthen networking and communication at all levels to broaden and enhance women's potential in economic activities;
p) Facilitate creation of sustainable jobs and livelihood opportunities to improve women's position in the labour market and ensure favourable working conditions for all women, including migrant women, consistent with all their human rights;
q) Enact and enforce legislation to guarantee the rights of women and men to equal pay for equal work or work of equal value;
r) Make adequate provisions for child care services and formulate policies that will enable parents to balance family responsibility with work responsibilities;
s) Demand the fulfilment by developed countries of the commitment of 0.7% of their Gross National Product to be devoted to Official Development Assistance, which is one of the key elements for the development of economic policies towards women; and
t) Promote the collection of gender disaggregated data both qualitative and quantitative for nationally monitoring and evaluating the impact of globalisation and trade liberalization on women.
Women in Power and Decision Making
Equal participation of women and men in decision-making will provide a balance that more accurately reflects the composition of society and is needed in order to strengthen democracy and promote quality growth.
However, little progress has been made in attaining positions of political power for women and they are largely under-represented in almost all sectors and at all levels of decision-making, including in the Government.
The increased participation of women at the decision-making level is essential to the empowerment of women.
We hereby commit ourselves to:
a) Formulate and adopt policies to increase participation and representation of women in all commissions, tribunals, local government bodies, statutory bodies, among others, set up by the government with the view to achieving equal representation of women;
b) Adopt affirmative action policies to increase the proportion of women at the decision-making level, at least to a minimum 30 percent in both public and private sector bodies including in the legislatures;
c) Review the criteria and process of appointment to decision-making bodies in the public and private sectors to encourage increased women's participation and representation;
d) Take measures, as appropriate, to ensure that political parties, trade unions and all other private sector bodies commit themselves to women's equal access to and full participation in power structures and decision making at all levels;
e) Raise awareness among women and men on the importance of women participation in decision making processes at all levels in political, economic and financial sectors, and in this connection, develop leadership training programmes for women, especially for young women, to enable them to exercise responsibilities at all levels;
f) Promote equal access to education, property rights and inheritance rights and to information technology and business and economic opportunities, including in international trade, in order to provide women with the tools that enable them to take part fully and equally in decision making processes at all levels; and
g) Facilitate and create enabling conditions to have access and to ensure active participation of women in decision-making positions both in urban and rural areas.
C. Women and Education
Education is a human right and an essential as well as a powerful tool for achieving gender equality, development and peace.
However, millions of children do not have access to schooling, the majority of whom are girls.
At the secondary and tertiary levels, women are still very much under-represented in the field of science and technology, particularly in engineering, physics and mathematics.
The advancement of women in NAM countries depends very much on their educational level and the quality of education they receive.
Male and female students should have equal access to education and benefit from teaching methods, academic orientation, counselling and curricula free of stereotyping and unaffected by gender-bias.
We hereby commit ourselves to:
a) Guarantee free and universal education to all as a key issue for the development of our societies and for the advancement of women and girls;
b) Create awareness of the importance of gender equality and develop gender analytic capabilities throughout the education and training system;
c) Take all appropriate measures to enforce compulsory education to 12th grade instead of 9th grade;
d) Take all appropriate measures to ensure that women and girls have equal opportunity and access at all levels to formal, informal and non-formal education as well as technical and vocational trainings, and set benchmarks to monitor progress;
Take all appropriate measures to ensure the equal participation of women in decision-making and management level in education systems;
f) Provide women and girls on equal basis with men and boys access to scholarships, study grants, financial aids and all other relevant facilities;
g) Eliminate negative stereotyping in all curricula and teaching materials made available to male and female students to fight discrimination against women;
h) Ensure that private sector educational institutions adhere to gender equality policy to encourage equal education of women and girls;
i) Take all necessary measures to strengthen public educational system to improve women's and girls access to all levels of education;
j) Promote illiteracy eradication programme and provide increased opportunities and facilities for lifelong learning for women;
k) Provide equal opportunities for women and girls to participate actively in all school programmes and activities;
l) Remove structural and cultural impediments to increase the enrolment of female students in science and technology disciplines at the tertiary level; and
m) Facilitate access to professional education to widows in war affected countries.
Women and Health
Establish training centres and raise funds to support and educate community-based health workers in remote areas.
Women's health is recognised as a central concern in promoting their well-being and ability to participate in all areas of public and private life.
Therefore, women have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.
Women in many parts of the world have different and unequal access to and use of basic resources, including primary health services for the prevention and treatment of various diseases.
Ensure safe motherhood and safe birthing for women living in conflict areas or in areas of natural catastrophes.
Ensure the protection of women and girls from sexual abuse in conflict areas.
The number of women and girls infected and affected by HIV and AIDS has been increasing steadily including the rate of death and is of grave concern to NAM countries.
The morbidity and mortality related to reproductive health, malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases are of major concern to NAM countries.
The social, developmental and health consequences of these diseases need to be examined from a gender perspective.
Preventive and comprehensive care and support and access to affordable medication in the context of such pandemics are essential elements of an effective response and are fundamental to achieving the full realization of the right of everyone, including women, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health.
We hereby commit ourselves to:
a) Formulate appropriate policies and programmes to address health rights of women from the perspective of women's needs and interests, taking into consideration distinctive features and factors that differ for women in comparison with men, particularly the different responsibilities in the care of those infected and affected by HIV and AIDS;
b) Ensure that women have equal access to health care services, information and education through out the life cycle;
c) Reaffirm the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, protect and promote the attainment of this right for women and girls and incorporate it in national legislation;
d) Provide adequate and gender-sensitive services to address all reproductive health needs and increase resources to such services;
e) Raise awareness and understanding among men and boys about their responsibilities of protecting women's health needs, particularly their reproductive health;
f) Provide necessary sexual education at school level as an effective HIV and AIDS prevention tool;
g) Promote gender-specific economic, social and legal measures aimed at combating persistent and emerging infectious diseases, inter alia the HIV and AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis pandemics and intensify prevention campaigns;
Take all necessary measures to empower women and strengthen their economic independence and to protect and promote their full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to enable them to protect themselves from HIV infection;
i) Address gender power relations in order to protect women and girls from being vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and HIV and AIDS related violence through legislation, law enforcement, advocacy and sensitization;
j) Encourage the establishment of a fund to ensure women's access to post-exposure prophylaxes, anti-retroviral treatment, mother-to-child transmission prevention treatment (before and after delivery), as well as support for homecare services;
k) Support the initiative of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and of other international bodies combating such pandemics, and encourage the Global Fund to develop effective far-reaching and comprehensive processes for the disbursement of funds;
l) Support the initiative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and relevant United Nations agencies, developed and developing countries and the private sector to make drugs related to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria more accessible to developing countries and noting that much more can be done in this regard, especially in respect of women;
m) Monitor and address the newly emerging types of violence and human rights abuses within the context of HIV and AIDS.
Priority should be given to making available and monitoring care and support services for preventing the exploitation and abuse of orphans;
n) Establish, as appropriate, gender indicators to monitor healthcare programmes, goals and outcomes, particularly for HIV and AIDS; and
o) Educate the society on the importance of social inclusion of people living with HIV and AIDS in particular women and girls.
E. Women, the Media and ICT
The emergence of new information and communication technologies (ICT) poses opportunities and challenges for the promotion of gender equality.
The role of ICT as a tool for development cannot be over-emphasised and is central to the empowerment of women in the developing countries.
It is particularly important to address gender-based discrimination and inequalities that undermine women's access to opportunities in the emerging knowledge and information society, and that diminish the potential of ICT and the media to be an effective tool for the promotion of gender equality.
The media in many countries do not provide a balanced picture of women's diverse lives and contributions to society.
In addition, violent and degrading or pornographic media products are also negatively affecting women and their participation in society.
Efforts must be made to stop the projection of negative and degrading images of women in the media communications - electronics, print, visual and audio.
Strengthen national and international measures to deter and stop cyber-crimes such as the utilization of the internet for trafficking of women and girls.
Promote the use of ICT network to connect the member countries of NAM for sharing of experiences and best practices.
We hereby commit ourselves to:
a) Develop domestic policies to ensure that gender perspective is fully integrated into ICT programmes, including in education and training at all levels, in curriculum development, teacher training, institutional administration, management and lifelong learning;
b) Promote early intervention programmes in ICT that target young girls in order to encourage them to involve themselves in ICT related disciplines and to increase the number of women in ICT careers;
c) Develop programmes that provide an opportunity for women to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge in order to understand, participate actively in, and benefit fully from ICT;
d) Create an enabling environment that will promote equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services;
e) Promote e-literacy programmes for women and girls, including those living in rural areas, to empower them with ICT related knowledge and skills;
f) Assist women entrepreneurs to increase their competitiveness through the use of ICT;
g) Facilitate women's access to capital and enhance their capacity to participate in ICT-related projects, including home-office projects;
h) Promote tele-working as an alternative mode of working for women in order to allow them to work flexible hours and locations;
i) Promote the exchange of best practices on the integration of gender perspectives in ICT education at all levels and strengthen cooperation among member countries on this issue;
j) Promote effective participation of women in national, regional and international forums on ICT;
k) Increase the participation and access of women to expression and decision-making in and through the media and the ICT;
l) Promote women's full participation in the media, including management, programming, education, training and research;
m) Promote a balanced and non-stereotyped portrayal of women in the media; and
n) Call upon the media to promote gender equality and the advancement of women and to intensify its contribution to combat violence against women including through awareness raising campaigns.
Women and Armed Conflict
War and militarism have profound adverse consequences on women and children.
Casualties of war, armed conflicts, including in situations of foreign occupation, are mostly civilians, the majority of whom are women and children.
However, women's participation in the peace and security, decision-making processes and agreement negotiations is very low.
Their absence at the peace table causes insufficient attention to and reflection of the concerns of women in peace and security processes.
Therefore, NAM Member States recognise that gender perspective is essential in addressing the special needs of women in armed conflict situation.
While both men and women suffer from the consequences of armed conflict, there is a differential impact on women and girls.
Integration of gender perspectives in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace building can significantly contribute to the protection of women and girls.
Express our grave concern over the suffering of Palestinian and Syrian women under Israeli occupation.
In particular, we strongly condemn the violation of their political, economic and social rights by the Israeli occupation.
We hereby commit ourselves to:
a) Support and strengthen international legal mechanisms to ensure that women and girls are protected from all forms of war crimes and gender-based violence;
b) Develop mechanisms that affirm and promote the role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building and stresses the importance of their full and equal participation in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security and the need to increase their role in decision-making with regard to conflict prevention and resolution and the rebuilding of post-conflict societies;
c) Take all appropriate measures to bring an end to situations of foreign occupation, armed conflict and terrorism, which remain a major obstacle for women with regard to their advancement, self-reliance and integration in the development planning of their society;
d) Address the various dimensions of rehabilitation and reintegration of women and girl refugees, including the psychological consequences of rape and other forms of gender-based violence;
e) Put in place mechanisms and programmes for the protection of women and girls in refugee and Internally Displaced Persons camps against violence and all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation and to ensure the enforcement of action against the perpetrators in accordance with the law;
f) Provide humanitarian assistance including the health needs, especially reproductive and sexual health of women and girls in conflict, refugee, and IDP situations;
g) Increase and hasten, as appropriate, subject to national security considerations, the conversion of military resources and related industries to development and peaceful purposes;
h) Reject the adoption of and demand to put an end to unilateral coercive measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations, that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected country, in particular women and children, that hinders their well-being and that creates obstacles to the full enjoyment of all their human rights;
i) Encourage, by all means, education on human rights and peace and to promote non-violence; and
j) Promote a culture of peace, dialogue among civilizations and tolerance and strengthen international solidarity and cooperation among peoples through education for all.
Violence against Women
Violence against women is an obstacle to the achievement of the objectives of equality, development and peace.
Violence against women violates and impairs and/or nullifies the enjoyment by women of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Violence affects the lives of millions of women worldwide, in all strata of the community impeding their ability to participate fully in society.
Assist governments of war-affected countries, upon their request, in the confiscating and disposal of small arms and light weapons used to inflict harm and violence in particular against women and children.
Violence against women takes a dismaying variety of forms.
Combating violence against women requires changing the way gender roles and power relations articulated in society.
NAM Member Countries should play a key role in eliminating gender-based violence especially during armed conflict, and in this regard stresses the importance of awareness-raising about UN Codes of Conduct for UN peacekeeping personnel.
We hereby commit ourselves to:
a) Review and amend all laws in order to identify and eliminate negative traditional and customary practices that discriminate against women;
b) Provide training to all relevant agencies, especially investigative personnel and the judiciary, national NGOs, communities and individuals on ways to prevent and address gender-based violence using integrated approaches;
c) Educate women and girls on their rights and provide legal aid, counselling and other support services;
d) Educate men and boys to respect women and girls as equal partners in all spheres of life and society and mobilize them against gender-based violence;
e) Enact and enforce legislation against the perpetrators of practices and acts of violence against women and children;
f) Develop and implement national, regional and international plans, multi-sectoral strategies and measures to combat all forms of violence, including trafficking in persons, particularly women and girls, child sexual exploitation and protection of migrant workers;
g) Document and disseminate case studies of good practices in combating violence against women and girls;
h) Create an enabling environment to combat all forms of violence against women and children living in situations of armed conflict and foreign occupation;
i) Establish appropriate national monitoring mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating implementation of measures taken to eliminate violence against women and girls;

l) Establish and strengthen, as appropriate, facilities for women to voice their complaints and care centres for the protection, counselling and rehabilitation of the victims of all forms of violence.
H. Women and Disaster Situations
The number, scale and impact of natural disasters in recent times have increased, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and over a million displaced and homeless persons.
Women and children account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by natural disasters and their aftermath.
We hereby commit ourselves to:
a) Integrate a gender perspective in post-disaster relief, recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts; and ensure that women take an active and equal role in all phases of disaster management and post-disaster recovery; and
b) Promote and support networks to prepare and respond to natural disasters with women and girls at the centre of all relief, rescue and rehabilitation work.
Gender Mainstreaming 48.
NAM member countries recognise that the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and its follow-up processes and the promotion of gender equality and of women's empowerment and participation, together with the widely accepted strategy of gender mainstreaming, are among the essential elements for advancing the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, with a view, in particular, to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration and the outcomes of United Nations summits, conferences and special sessions.
Gender mainstreaming in all legislation, policies, and programmes is an essential process to women's empowerment and their full participation in all spheres of society.
It facilitates the integration of women's differing experience and needs into the development process, as well into the society and helps to change the negative social norms that discriminate against women.
NAM member States recognise that effective gender mainstreaming is critical to the empowerment of women and to the achievement of gender equality.
We hereby commit ourselves to:a) Take all necessary measures, including in the area of law, policy, programme and activities to eliminate discrimination against women within public and private sectors;
b) Implement affirmative actions, where needed, to accelerate de facto equality rights of women in all spheres;
c) Raise awareness about women's right to equality and the importance of women's participation and representation in all spheres and at all levels in order to eliminate obstacles to women's equality;
d) Establish benchmarks, indicators and accurate sex-disaggregated databases for more effective planning, implementation and evaluation of progress for the attainment of de facto equality for women, and monitoring nationally the same;
e) Take steps to ensure that women will benefit equally from all development efforts and women's perspectives, concerns and interests are integrated into every sector of national development plans;
f) Strengthen national machineries for the advancement of women in order to act as a catalyst for promoting gender mainstreaming and structure appropriately their functions at all levels in order to ensure effectiveness and accountability in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of national policies for achieving gender equality and to strengthen international development cooperation including through exchange of good experiences and best practices;
g) Provide national machineries for the advancement of women with the necessary and adequate human and financial resources, including through exploring innovative funding schemes, so that gender mainstreaming is integrated into the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all policies, programmes and projects;
h) Draw up and strengthen legal literacy programmes;
i) Encourage and facilitate harmonious partnership and equal sharing of domestic roles and responsibilities for the family by women and men, girls and boys;
j) Recognise the role of civil society, in particular women's non-governmental organizations, in contributing to the development, design, implementation and evaluation of national gender equality initiatives at local, regional and national levels including through open and participatory dialogue; and
k) Encourage cooperation and interaction between Governments and members of civil society, including non-governmental organisations and private sector, in the implementation of all of the above commitments to the advancement of women to ensure their empowerment and their full participation in all sectors and at all levels.
We, the Ministers and other Heads of Delegation from Member Countries of the Non-Aligned Movement hereby:
Agree to recommend to the Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement that the issue of the advancement of women be integrated into the mainstream programmes and activities of NAM and that the NAM Ministerial Meeting on the Advancement of Women be convened on a biennial basis; and
Welcome the proposal of Malaysia to initiate the establishment of a centre on gender and development for NAM in Malaysia, which will serve as an international institution dedicated to women's development and empowerment through a lifelong learning approach.
