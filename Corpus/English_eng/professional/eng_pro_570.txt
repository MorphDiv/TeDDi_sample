Letter dated 20 October 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Spain to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly
In accordance with the decision adopted at the Fifteenth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Ibero-American Conference, held in Salamanca on 14 and 15 October 2005, and in accordance with rule 15 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly, I have the honour to request the inclusion of an additional item in the agenda of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly, entitled “Granting of observer status in the General Assembly to the Ibero-American Conference”.
In accordance with rule 20 of the Rules of Procedure, I attach an explanatory memorandum (see annex I) in support of the request and a draft resolution on the subject (see annex II).
I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annexes distributed as a document of the General Assembly.
(Signed) Juan Antonio Yáñez-Barnuevo Permanent Representative
Annex I
Explanatory memorandum
The First Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government, held in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1991, set up the Ibero-American Conference of Heads of State and Government, with the participation of the sovereign Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking States of the Americas and Europe.
The Ibero-American Summits of Heads of State and Government held in Guadalajara, Mexico (1991), Madrid (1992) and Salvador, Bahia, Brazil (1993) laid the foundations of the Ibero-American community and recognized that democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are the pillars of that community.
The Summits held to date (some of which were attended by the Secretary-General of the United Nations) have reiterated the full validity of and their commitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
The Summit of Heads of State and Government is the highest forum of the Ibero-American Conference, which also comprises the meetings of ministers for foreign affairs, meetings of the regional coordinating offices responsible for cooperation and Ibero-American sectoral ministerial meetings.
The Fifth Summit of Heads of State and Government, held in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, in 1995, established the institutional framework regulating cooperation relations among the members of the Conference.
According to the San Carlos de Bariloche Agreement on Cooperation in the Framework of the Ibero-American Conference (article 2), the purpose of cooperation programmes and projects within the framework of the Ibero-American Conference shall be basically to promote an Ibero-American identity through joint action in the areas of education, culture, science and technology with a view to developing an Ibero-American sphere of cooperation.
At the Eighth Ibero-American Summit, held in Oporto, Portugal, in 1998, the Heads of State and Government agreed to set up the Secretariat for Ibero-American Cooperation (SECIB), which was formally constituted at the Ninth Ibero-American Summit, held in Havana in 1999.
At the Thirteenth Summit, held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, in 2003, the Ibero-American Secretariat (SEGIB) was established as a successor to SECIB and as an international organization with its own legal personality.
SEGIB has its Headquarters in Madrid and, as an organ providing support to the Ibero-American Conference, has the following aims: (a) to contribute to the strengthening of the Ibero-American community and to give it international prominence; (b) to assist in the preparatory process for the Ibero-American Summits and for all Ibero-American meetings; (c) to consolidate the work done in the cooperation area within the framework of the Ibero-American Conference, promoting cooperation in accordance with the Bariloche Agreement; and (d) to promote the historical, cultural, social and economic ties among the Ibero-American countries, recognizing and valuing the diversity of their peoples.
SEGIB has a secretary-general, appointed by consensus by the Heads of State and Government at the proposal of the plenary meeting of ministers for foreign affairs.
His term of office is four years and he is assisted by a deputy secretary and the secretary for Ibero-American cooperation.
The Fourteenth Summit of Heads of State and Government, held in San José, Costa Rica, in 2004, agreed on the statute that will govern the Ibero-American Secretariat as a permanent organ providing institutional, technical and administrative support to the Ibero-American Conference and responsible for fulfilling the mandates it receives from the summits of ministers for foreign affairs and for assisting the secretariat pro tempore with preparations for the Ibero-American Summits.
The Ibero-American Secretariat was set in motion at the Fifteenth Summit of Heads of State and Government, held in Salamanca, Spain, in 2005, with the appointment of its first secretary-general, Enrique V. Iglesias.
It was given the task of following up the various hunger- and poverty-eradication initiatives under way within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals by promoting debt-for-education programmes within the Ibero-American community.
Bearing in mind the mandate of the Fifteenth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government in Salamanca, as contained in the Salamanca Declaration, and with a view to strengthening and institutionalizing the relations of the Ibero-American Conference with the United Nations in order to improve cooperation between the two organizations, it would be appropriate for the Ibero-American Conference to be granted observer status in the General Assembly.
