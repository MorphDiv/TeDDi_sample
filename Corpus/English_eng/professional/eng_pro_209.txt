In my capacity as Chairman of the Group of Eastern European States for the month of February, I have the honour to forward to you herewith a letter from the States members of the Group of Eastern European States eligible for non-permanent membership of the Security Council in response to the recommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenge and Change concerning the enlargement of the Security Council, endorsed by the members of the Group (see annex).
In addition, as Chairman of the Group of Eastern European States for the month of February, I propose that the letter be circulated as a document of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly.

Annex to the identical letters dated 28 February 2005 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Croatia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly
Letter from the States members of the Group of Eastern European States eligible for non-permanent membership of the Security Council in response to the recommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenge and Change concerning the enlargement of the Security Council
The States members of the Group of Eastern European States eligible for non-permanent membership of the Security Council thoroughly analysed the recommendations concerning the enlargement of the Security Council contained in the report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenge and Change, entitled “A more secure world: our shared responsibility”.
These Member States wish to emphasize that the two models for the enlargement of the Security Council, as presented by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenge and Change, do not meet their expectations.
These Member Sates further emphasize that existing regional groups should be maintained.
These Member States reiterate their view, stated in the joint position paper of May 1998 (see A/52/47, annex XXIII), that any increase in the non-permanent membership of the Security Council should ensure an enhanced representation of the Eastern European Group by the allocation to the said Group of at least one additional non-permanent seat in the enlarged Council.
These Member States wish to emphasize the fact that, since 1991, the Eastern European Group has more than doubled its membership.
These Member States fully support the need to reform the Security Council in order to make it more representative and effective and are confident that the legitimate interests of the Eastern European Group will be fully taken into account in this process.
