Financing of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor
Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 and proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
Introduction
On 18 May 2005, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions was provided with updated financial and human resource requirements for the liquidation of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) for the period from 1 July to 31 October 2005 (see annexes I and II below).
The updated requirements amount to $1.7 million, representing a decrease of approximately $2.2 million in comparison with the original liquidation budget of $3.9 million proposed in document A/59/637.
The Committee is recommending acceptance of the updated proposal for UNMISET for the period, as set out in annexes I and II below.
The documents used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the financing of UNMISET are listed at the end of the present report.
Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004
On the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, the General Assembly, by its resolutions 57/327 of 18 June 2003 and 58/260 A of 23 December 2003, appropriated the total amount of $208,827,500 gross ($202,273,200 net) for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004.
Expenditures for the period totalled $196,007,600 gross ($189,061,200 net), which is $12,819,900, or 6.1 per cent, lower than the appropriation of $208,827,500 (see A/59/655, sect.
The unutilized balance was attributable mainly to lower requirements for military contingents, civilian police and international staff owing to a faster rate of downsizing of such personnel than anticipated, as well as savings under air transportation as a result of a reduction in flight hours following a decrease in the Mission's helicopter fleet from 14 to 12.
Savings were offset in part by additional requirements under consultants and general temporary assistance due to the retention of advisers of the Civilian Support Group beyond 31 December 2003, under United Nations Volunteers because of higher average monthly costs for Volunteers than budgeted, and under national staff as a result of a higher than anticipated incumbency rate.
Information on performance for the current period
Information on performance for the current period is contained in annex II to the Advisory Committee's general report on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736).
Proposed liquidation budget for the period from 1 July to 31Â October 2005
The proposed budget for UNMISET for the 2005/06 period (A/59/637), which was issued on 21 December 2004, provided for the phased downsizing and completion of the administrative liquidation of the Mission by 31 October 2005, estimated at $3,856,200.
The Mission's operational activities, with the exception of the remaining liquidation tasks, are to be completed by 30 June 2005.
Following a review of the requirements and taking into account substantial progress achieved in the liquidation of UNMISET during the current financial period, the Mission determined that the proposed liquidation budget could be reduced by some $2.2 million, to $1,662,200.
Accordingly, on 18 May 2005 the Committee was provided with updated information on resource and staffing requirements (see annexes I and II below).
The updated human resources requirements show a reduction of $1,062,800 in comparison with the initial liquidation budget of $2,061,000 presented in document A/59/637 and provide for the phased drawdown of 136 civilian personnel (38 international staff, 90 national staff and 8 United Nations Volunteers), as compared with 213 civilian personnel (78 international staff, 119 national staff and 16 United Nations Volunteers) proposed in the initial liquidation budget.
Updated requirements under operational costs reflect a reduction of $1,131,200 in comparison with the initial estimate of $1,795,200.
The Advisory Committee was informed that this was due mainly to reduced requirements under facilities and infrastructure owing to the utilization of stocks and supplies acquired during the current financial period and under commercial communications owing to the reduction in the number of international staff.
The Advisory Committee notes that the Security Council, by its resolution 1599 (2005) of 28 April 2005, decided to establish a one-year follow-on special political mission, the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL), which will remain in Timor-Leste until 20 May 2006.
The Committee understands that the proposed budget for UNOTIL is currently under preparation.
Estimates are to be submitted to the General Assembly, through the Advisory Committee, for funding under section 3, Political affairs, of the regular budget.
Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 15 May 2005, a total of $11,619,325 in assets had been donated to the Government of Timor-Leste and that it was estimated that the UNOTIL asset balance would begin with approximately 7,300 items of UNMISET assets as from 21 May 2005.
The exact number of assets to be transferred to UNOTIL and their corresponding inventory value will be known in early July 2005.
Conclusions
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNMISET for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 is indicated in paragraph 25 of the performance report (A/59/655).
The Advisory Committee recommends that the unencumbered balance of $12,819,900, as well as other income and adjustments amounting to $5,246,000, be credited to Member States in a manner to be determined by the General Assembly.
In connection with the financing of UNMISET for the period from 1 July to 31 October 2005, the Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the proposal of the Secretary-General contained in paragraph 21 of the proposed budget (A/59/637) as updated on 18 May 2005 (see annexes I and II below).
