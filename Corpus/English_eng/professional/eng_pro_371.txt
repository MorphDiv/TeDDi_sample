Agenda item 53
Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and related matters
Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Italy, Malta, Mexico, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, San Marino, Spain and Turkey: draft resolution
Reform of the Security Council
The General Assembly,
Recalling its resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, by which it decided to amend the Charter of the United Nations to increase the number of non-permanent members of the Security Council from six to ten, on the basis of the increase in the membership of the United Nations since 1945,
Recalling the various reports of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council, established by its resolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993,
Stressing the urgent need to improve the working methods of the Security Council in accordance with the various issues discussed within the Open-ended Working Group, in particular the question of transparency in decision-making; accountability; fairer opportunities of participation of Member States; better access to information by all Member States and restrictions on the veto power with a view to its eventual elimination,
Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration of 2000 and taking note of the report of the Secretary-General entitled “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all”, in particular its assessment of the interlocking nature of security, development and human rights, and reaffirming that the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, can only be achieved through the full implementation of the mandates contained in the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (“Johannesburg Plan of Implementation”), among other development commitments,
Mindful of primary responsibility conferred by the Charter of the United Nations on the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security and that in carrying out its duties the Security Council acts on behalf of the Members of the United Nations,
Mindful also of the importance of strengthening the institutional balance and interrelationship among the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council within the scope of the comprehensive reform of the United Nations,
Considering that joint efforts by the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council are needed in order to attain solutions to global problems and threats in an integrated and constructive manner,
Considering that the present composition of the Security Council is inequitable and unbalanced,
Recognizing that contemporary world realities, in particular the substantial increase in membership of developing countries since 1963, requires an expansion of the Security Council, in the non-permanent category, in order to ensure fairer opportunities of participation for all Member States,
Reaffirming that any expansion of the Security Council should make it more democratic, more equitably representative, more transparent, more effective and more accountable,
Convinced that periodic elections and re-elections are the strongest means to promote real accountability, allow for frequent rotation and fair and equitable representation of the Member States in the Security Council,
Recalling its resolution 53/30 of 23 November 1998,
Recognizing the importance of reaching the broadest possible agreement on all major issues, including Security Council reform, as decided in resolution 59/291 of 15 April 2005,
Recalling Article 108 of the Charter of the United Nations,
Amendments to Article 23
Decides that the Security Council shall consist, in addition to the five permanent members as determined by Article 23, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations, of twenty elected Members of the United Nations serving on the Security Council for a two-year term, according to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 5 below;
Decides, in view of the above, to adopt the following amendments to the Charter and to submit them for ratification by the States Members of the United Nations;

Majority required for Security Council decisions
Decides to amend also Article 27, paragraphs 2 and 3, and Article 109, paragraph 1, of the Charter to require the affirmative vote of fifteen of the twenty-five members of the Security Council;

(a) Restraint on the use of the veto;
(b) Procedures to guarantee transparency in decision-making, accountability in performance and access to information, including open briefings and interaction with all interested parties;
