Sixth Meeting
Zagreb, 28 November - 2 December 2005
Item 11 of the provisional agenda
Consideration of the general status and
operation of the Convention
Presented by the President of the Sixth Meeting of the States Parties
Rule 1.4 of the Rules of Procedure for the Sixth Meeting of the States Parties (6MSP) states that actors other than those covered elsewhere in the Rules of Procedure “that have received an invitation from the Coordinating Committee may attend the Meeting of the States Parties as observers, subject to approval of the Meeting of the States Parties.”
Rule 1.4 continues by saying that “in issuing invitations to others to attend the Meeting of the States Parties as observers, the Coordinating Committee shall take into consideration criteria such as whether the proposed observer is a non-profit entity and whether its purpose and activities are consistent with the object and purpose of the Convention.”
The President wishes to inform the 6MSP that the following organizations requested status as observers in accordance with Rule 1.4 and that the Coordinating agreed that they should be provided with such status, subject to the approval of the 6MSP itself.
Hence, the President seeks the agreement of the States Parties that the following organizations be accepted as observers:
Association de Solidarité des Handicapés et Victimes de Mines French National Commission for the Elimination of Landmine (CNEMA)
International Peace Research Institute (PRIO) International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims Assistance (ITF) Mine Action Information Center (James Madison University) Regional Arms Control Verification and Implementation Assistance Centre (RACVIAC) South Eastern Europe Clearing House for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SEESAC) Swiss Foundation for Demining (SFD) World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM)
Rule 1.2 states that “relevant international organizations or institutions and regional organizations may attend the Meeting of the States Parties as observers.” In addition, Rule 1.3 states that “the United Nations Secretary-General, the UNHCR, UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, WFP, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Sovereign Order of Malta, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining may attend the Meeting of the States Parties as observers.”
