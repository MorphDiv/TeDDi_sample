Human resources management
Staffing of field missions, including the use of 300 and 100 series appointments
Report of the Secretary-General
Introduction
The General Assembly, in its resolution 58/296, decided to suspend the application of the four-year maximum limit for appointments of limited duration under the 300 series of staff rules in peacekeeping operations until 31 December 2004 and requested the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report on the use of 300 series contracts for meeting current and future human resources requirements for peacekeeping missions.
The comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on the staffing of field missions, including the use of 300 and 100 series appointments, outlined the current international context under which peacekeeping operations are deployed and the changing expectations of Member States and legislative bodies of the role of peacekeeping.
In that report the Secretary-General also proposed measures to strengthen the human resources management of peacekeeping operations, enabling a better response to changing operational requirements and circumstances, and in that connection sought the approval of the Assembly to use the 100 series appointment for the recruitment of staff in field missions for six months or longer in cases where there is a continuing requirement.
Having considered the above-mentioned report of the Secretary-General, the General Assembly, in section X of resolution 59/266, decided to continue to suspend the application of the four-year maximum limit for appointments of limited duration under the 300 series of the Staff Rules in peacekeeping operations until 30 June 2005.
In the same section, the Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to reappoint under the 100 series of the Staff Rules those mission staff whose service under 300-series contracts had reached the four-year limit by 31 December 2004, pending a decision by the Assembly, provided that their functions had been reviewed and found necessary and that their performance record had been confirmed as fully satisfactory.
The Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to report on those staff who were reappointed from 300 to 100 series contracts after reaching the four-year limit by 31 December 2004 or later, and to submit proposals for which functions are relevant for reappointment under the 100 series.
The present report provides the information requested on the mission staff reappointed from 300 to 100 series contracts after reaching the four-year limit of their 300 series contract.
The report also proposes to use the 100 series contract for staff members performing functions for which there is a continuing need and to continue to use the 300 series contract for the appointment of staff performing short-term functions of a duration of less than one year.
Reappointment of staff from 300 to 100 series contracts
By 30 June 2005, a total of 346 international staff will have reached, or exceeded, four years of service under 300 series appointments of limited duration.
These 346 staff members were considered for reappointment under a 100 series contract in accordance with the criteria set out in section X, paragraph 2, of resolution 59/266, that is, that their functions had been reviewed and found necessary and that their performance had been confirmed as fully satisfactory.
As a result of this review, 287 staff members met the criteria for reappointment from 300 to 100 series contracts set out in resolution 59/266.
Forty-eight staff members did not meet this criteria, due either to the anticipated downsizing or to closure of the mission in which they were serving.
These 48 staff members remain employed under a 300 series contract.
In addition, four staff who will reach mandatory age of separation by 30 June 2005 did not meet the criteria for reappointment, as there was no expectation of their continued service.
The reappointment of five staff members whose performance record had not been confirmed as fully satisfactory had not been approved.
The recommendation for reappointment of two staff members is still pending consideration.
A breakdown of the number of staff who met the criteria for reappointment from a 300 to a 100 series contract, as well as those who did not, is provided in tableÂ 1 in the annex to the present report.
Table 2, also in the annex, provides a breakdown of staff who met the criteria for reappointment from 300 to 100 series by functions performed.
It may be noted that in some cases the functions being performed by staff reappointed under 100 series contracts are distinct to the mandate of a specific mission and are not necessarily skills that can be easily transferred to other missions.
Nevertheless, that particular mission has a continuing need for the services of these staff beyond the four-year limit provided for under the 300 series contract.
For example, the expertise of a Municipal Officer in the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) carrying out governance functions would not be needed in other missions; UNMIK, however, has a continuing requirement for the services of a Municipal Officer beyond four years.
In the light of this continuing need, and after confirmation that a staff member's performance record had been at least fully satisfactory, the staff member is considered eligible for reappointment from a 300 to a 100 series contract limited to service with that specific mission.
Proposed functions
The General Assembly in its resolution 59/266, requested the Secretary-General to submit proposals for which functions are relevant for reappointment under the 100 series of the Staff Rules.
In considering which functions are relevant for appointment under a 100 series contract, the Department was mindful of the intended purpose of the 100 and 300 series appointments and the nature of the functions performed.
It may be recalled that the 100 series contract is intended for the employment of staff of the Secretariat appointed by, or on behalf of, the Secretary-General for a period of one year or more, or whose appointments for a lesser period are extended to one year or more, to carry out the substantive programmes and to perform the support and service functions which are mandated by the Charter of the United Nations or by the legislative bodies of the Organization as the direct responsibility of the Secretary-General.
The 300 series appointment of limited duration is intended for activities of a limited duration not expected to exceed three years, including peacekeeping and peacemaking, humanitarian, technical cooperation and emergency operations.
As described in the comprehensive report on the staffing of field missions,1 demands for peacekeeping missions have increased while at the same time mission mandates have grown more complex involving a variety of tasks, including political, governance, humanitarian, human rights, rule of law and security and protection, in addition to the traditional peacekeeping functions.
Missions often operate in complex post-conflict situations, contributing to the development or rebuilding of governance and social structures.
As a result, missions are more likely to have a duration of longer than three years.
The environment in which peacekeeping missions operate is also becoming more dangerous.
The new peacekeeping model requires that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations be able to:
(a) Attract, recruit and develop highly-skilled and experienced staff who are able to effectively operate in difficult mission environments;
(b) Retain these staff, as missions are likely to have a duration of longer than three years;
(c) Adequately compensate staff for the dangerous and difficult conditions under which they serve.
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations proposes that the 100 series appointment be used as the contractual instrument for the employment of staff performing functions that are not, by their nature, temporary or limited in duration, and for which the Department has a continuing need for one year or longer, in line with ST/SGB/177.
The 300 series appointment of limited duration would be used as the contractual instrument for the employment of staff performing functions that are temporary in nature, with a limited duration of under one year.
These have been identified as electoral assistance, border monitoring and short-term projects.
The use of 100 series appointments for functions of a continuing nature would also help to harmonize, to an extent, the conditions of service between different groups of staff in field missions and to promote the harmonization of conditions of service of Secretariat field staff with field staff of the agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system, thereby strengthening the ability to recruit and retain high quality peacekeeping personnel.
Conclusion
The Department of Peacekeeping Operations continues to face increasing demands for complex peacekeeping operations as well as increasing expectations that it improve its capacity to effectively plan and manage peace operations and respond quickly and effectively to any Security Council mandate.
To respond to these demands, the Department must have the capacity to rapidly deploy experienced, trained and capable civilian peacekeepers in adequate numbers to support peacekeeping operations.
Creating this capacity requires that the Organization be able to: attract high calibre candidates, invest in developing high-performing civilian staff, in particular for leadership and management positions, and retain these staff.
In order to both recruit and retain such staff, competitive conditions of service and contractual arrangements are necessary.
Accordingly, the Secretary-General seeks the agreement of the General Assembly to use the 100 series contract for staff members performing functions for which there is a continuing need and to continue to use the 300 series contract for the appointment of staff performing short-term functions having a duration of less than one year.
Pending the consideration of this proposal by the General Assembly, the Secretariat also seeks approval to continue the practice of reappointing serving staff under 100 series contracts, on a case-by-case basis, after they reach the maximum period of service permitted under a 300 series appointment of limited duration, subject to the criteria set out in section X, paragraph 2, of resolution 59/266, that is, a continuing need for their services and a fully satisfactory performance record.
