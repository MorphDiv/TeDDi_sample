Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing
of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Budget for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Mandate and planned results
The United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, has been in operation since late 1994 under a rent-free arrangement with the Republic of Italy.
The memorandum of understanding regarding the use by the United Nations of the facilities was signed by the Secretary-General and the Republic of Italy on 23 November 1994 and was amended on 7 December 2001.
The overall objective for the Logistics Base is to ensure efficient and effective peacekeeping.
Within this overall objective, the Base will, during the budget period, contribute to one expected accomplishment by delivering related key outputs, shown in the framework below.
The outputs are grouped under the following core support functions: strategic deployment stocks and United Nations reserve stocks management; communications hub and information technology network operations; training services; management and administration of UNLB; San Vito refurbishment plan.
As compared to 2004/05, the presentation of the framework along five programmatic lines has been discontinued in favour of a standard presentation.
The programmatic approach first introduced in 2003/04 and restricted to the framework only in 2004/05 has proven difficult to implement both in financial and organizational terms, given the financial cross-subsidies between the five programmes and the need for a conventional administrative structure which parallels those of the missions and headquarters.
Variances in the number of personnel, compared to the budget of 2004/05, including redeployments and reclassifications, have been explained under the support component.
The budget includes estimates in relation to the proposed expansion of UNLB into the former United States military base at San Vito, 10 kilometres from its present facilities.
UNLB has outgrown the existing facilities at the Base for communication and information technology operations and is constrained in terms of open storage areas, particularly for vehicle parking.
The expansion to San Vito is aimed at establishing a state-of-the-art communications hub and a business continuity and disaster recovery centre for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other users, and at collocating the storage area for strategic deployment stocks transport assets in a more operationally efficient location.
The proposed expansion is expected to be completed in three phases, with an estimated cost of $8,854,680.
The present budget includes $5,123,680 as phase 1 of the three-phase expansion plan.
Component: support
Human resources: support component
The following posts are proposed in the budget:
(a) The addition of five international posts and one national post for the purpose of establishing a permanent training cell at UNLB.
This training cell will develop the modules and deliver and coordinate external resource persons (such as senior Department of Peacekeeping Operations staff) for the four courses which will encompass 240 participants during a 12-month period as part of a programme to build a cadre of civilian peacekeeping professionals.
The courses include: core values and core competencies training (four per year), team-building (two per year), peacekeeping-planning and management (one per year) and senior leadership induction (one per year).
The international posts would comprise two P-4s and three P-3s.
The responsibilities of the proposed posts will be as follows:
- One P-4 for the coordination of the design and delivery of team-building, peacekeeping-planning and management and senior leadership induction courses.
The incumbent will also develop and deliver leadership, management and communication modules for each course and liaise with missions to ensure that training meets mission needs;
- One P-4 for the coordination of the design and delivery of the core values, core competencies and mission start-up training courses.
The incumbent will also develop and deliver planning skills and exercise/simulation modules for each course and support the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the development and conduct of exercises;
- One P-3 for the development and delivery (and coordination of external facilitators) of substantive, mission support and military and civilian police modules for each course;
- One P-3 for the development and delivery (in collaboration with the Office of Human Resources Management) of the mission readiness skills modules for each course;
- One P-3 for the design and implementation of participant selection and training evaluation mechanisms.
The incumbent will also develop and implement United Nations system and capacity-building modules for each course;
- One national staff to support the five training officers in the preparation of course material and the running of a training office and to provide routine administration in support of the training staff and the participants;
(b) The addition of one national staff under the Office of Administrative Support Services as security and safety assistant, to support the chief security officer in managing security liaison at San Vito in conjunction with the Italian Ministry of Defence and prepare and implement security-related measures to ensure the protection of United Nations assets and facilities at that location.
The incumbent will also assist in the organization and provision of the safety and security programme for all UNLB staff in compliance with the existing safety and security rules and regulations;
(c) The addition of two national staff under the Office of Technical Support Services for data cleansing and codification of all United Nations property.
The proposed staff will ensure standardization of codes across asset management sections and monitor and periodically verify missions' ongoing codification, thereby improving management's view of United Nations property holdings and facilitate the process of recording receipt and inspection of materials by minimizing the future need for assigning temporary item codes and reducing data entry time.
In addition, the budget contains a proposal to regularize 64 individual contractors that are under “operational costs” in the financial period 2004/05 into 64 national posts (fixed-term under the 100 series of the Staff Rules).
These contractors currently perform core functions and are required by UNLB on a continuing basis independent of the strategic deployment stocks surge capacity requirements.
The breakdown of the proposed conversions is as follows:
- Office of the Chief Administrative Officer: one post of liaison assistant;
- Office of Administrative Support Services: a total of six posts, with one under “procurement”, three under “finance” and two under “personnel”;
- Office of Technical Support Services: a total of 57 posts, with 15 under “engineering”, 10 under “supply and warehousing”, 10 under “transport”, 20 under “communications and information technology” and 2 under “air operations”.
The budget also includes the following deployments to regularize changes made internally and since classified by the Office of Human Resources Management:
- One field service post is deployed within Administrative Support Services from the security office to the personnel office to strengthen the management of personnel in the areas of local staff recruitment and administration, as strongly recommended by the Office of Human Resources Management in an evaluation of UNLB personnel services;
- One Field Service post is deployed from the transport office under “Office of Technical Support Services” to the procurement office under “Office of Administrative Support Services” to improve the management and supervision of contracts and general procurement activities;
- One international staff (P-3) post is deployed within Technical Support Services from the air operations office to the engineering office to strengthen the management of all engineering projects, oversee design and implementation and employment of consultants for technical assessments and writing of statements of work and evaluation of technical proposals.
Resource requirements

B. Training
The estimated requirements for training for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 are as follows:
(Thousands of United States dollars)
The proposed training requirements encompass courses/workshops on vehicle maintenance and spare parts management, on dangerous goods for certification in handling of dangerous goods, on communication and information technology to keep staff up to date with continuous technological developments and innovations, on team-building and conflict resolution and on contract law and commercial/legal negotiations.
C. Non-budgeted contributions
The estimated value of non-budgeted contributions for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 is as follows:
(Thousands of United States dollars)
a Inclusive of office buildings, workshop structures and warehouse structures provided by the Republic of Italy.
Analysis of variances
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The additional requirements relate to the five new posts comprising two P-4s and three P-3s proposed for the training cell.
• Management: conversion of 64 individual contractors
The increased requirements relate mainly to the conversion of 64 individual contractors into national staff.
In addition, four new posts comprising one for security, two for codification services and one for the training cell are included in the estimates.
• Management: change in account code
The increased requirements relate mainly to estimates for training consultants which were previously budgeted under “other supplies, services and equipment”.
As included in phase 1 of the San Vito plan, the estimates include $160,000 for consultancy work to survey the San Vito site and buildings, the development of detailed plans and designs, and certification by a locally certified consultant in conformity with local law.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The reduced requirements are mainly under “travel for training”, as more training programmes are organized in Brindisi, thus reducing the need for Logistics Base staff to travel abroad.
• Management: increased inputs and outputs
The increased requirements are mainly in relation to phase 1 of the San Vito plan.
Estimates include $4,376,000 for the construction of strategic deployment stocks vehicle storage and hard-standing at San Vito to enable the relocation of strategic deployment stocks vehicles from San Pancranzio, refurbishment of 2,500 m2 of office and technological workspace and the construction of slabs for antennas, prefabricated conduits for cables from antennas and other works for the new communications and information technology hub at San Vito.
• Management: conversion of 10 individual contractors
The reduced requirements are due mainly to the proposed conversion of 10 individual contractors to national posts.
Management: additional inputs and outputs
Additional requirements are due mainly to the acquisition of information technology equipment valued at $368,000 for the proposed expansion in San Vito.
In addition, $320,000 is proposed for the hiring of four international specialized contract technicians to perform the weekly back-up of 100 per cent of United Nations Headquarters and peacekeeping missions' critical databases in the Disaster Recovery Centre, which will be located at Brindisi during this budget period, but will move to the San Vito site when established.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
Additional requirements relate to the contracting of the services of a doctor and part-time nurse to provide medical services to UNLB staff.
• Cost parameters: change in contract modality
The increased requirements relate to the subcontracting from April 2006 of 56 individual contractors to a service company.
This follows the UNLB policy to discontinue hiring individual contractors for non-core work and surge capacity.
The estimates also include a decrease of $153,200 in relation to the training consultants, which are now budgeted under the “consultants” category.
Actions to be taken by the General Assembly
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the United Nations Logistics Base are:
(a) Approval of the amount of $37,691,900, for the maintenance of the Logistics Base for the 12-month period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006;
(b) A decision to apply the unencumbered balance of $149,000 and other income/adjustments of $2,292,000, as proposed in paragraph 17 (a) and (b) of the report of the Secretary-General (A/59/681), to the resources required for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006;
(c) Proration of the amount of $35,250,900 among the individual active peacekeeping operation budgets to meet the financing requirements of the Logistics Base for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006.
