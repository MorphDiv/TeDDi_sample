Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 123
Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Review of the management structure of all peacekeeping operations
Note by the Secretary-General
The General Assembly, in its decision 59/507 of 29 October 2004, requested the Secretary-General to submit to it at the second part of its resumed fifty-ninth session a report on the review of the management structure of all peacekeeping operations, inter alia, through administrative comparisons, as appropriate, taking into account the complexities, mandates and specificities of each operation and the necessity of carrying out effectively and efficiently each operation.
The Secretariat regrets that it is unable to provide the report requested by the General Assembly for consideration during the second part of the resumed fifty-ninth session.
The requested report will require the collection of data on mission staffing as well as an in-depth review of the management structures of 17 peacekeeping missions and at least two special political missions, and a detailed analysis of the commonalities and variations of structures and levels in all of the operations, taking into account a number of factors, including the differences in mandate, size, concept of operations and mission environment.
The Secretariat is currently in the process of reconciling the staffing tables of all peacekeeping missions and consolidating data on staffing and organizational structures that are critical elements in the analysis required to produce the report.
In addition, owing to the ongoing surge in planning and deployment of new peacekeeping missions, limited resources have been available to produce a credible report in the time allocated.
Once the data collection is completed, the comprehensive review and analysis of the management structure of peacekeeping operations will be undertaken.
The Secretary-General will submit the requested report on the management structure of peacekeeping operations for consideration by the General Assembly at the second part of its resumed sixtieth session.
