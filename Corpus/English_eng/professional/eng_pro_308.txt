The plenary meetings will be held in the General Assembly Hall.
The informal interactive dialogue will be held in Conference Room 4.
The venues of the multi-stakeholder round tables will be announced at a later stage.
All scheduled meetings will be announced in the Journal of the United Nations.
Overall theme
The overall theme of the High-level Dialogue will be “The Monterrey Consensus: status of implementation and tasks ahead”.
C. Schedule of meetings and organization of work
The High-level Dialogue will consist of a series of plenary and informal meetings to constitute a policy dialogue on the overall theme stated above and six interactive multi-stakeholder round tables on the themes based on the structure of the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development.1 The proposed programme of the High-level Dialogue is contained in the annex to the present note.
D. Plenary meetings
The plenary meetings, chaired by the President of the General Assembly, will be held on Monday, 27 June 2005, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
At these meetings, ministers and high-level officials attending the Dialogue will be able to make formal statements, on the understanding that the principle of precedence will be strictly applied, to allow participation at the ministerial level.
Each oral statement will be limited to five minutes, on the understanding that this will not preclude the distribution of more extensive texts.
The plenary meeting on the morning of Monday, 27 June, will begin with the formal opening of the High-level Dialogue by the President of the General Assembly.
At the opening the Assembly will be able to take up any remaining organizational matters.
In addition, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the President of the World Bank, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund and the Director-General of the World Trade Organization will be invited to make statements.
The next plenary meeting, which will be held on the afternoon of Monday, 27 June, will begin with the statements by the President of the Economic and Social Council, the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, as the Chairman of the United Nations Development Group.
A plenary meeting will be held on the afternoon of Tuesday, 28 June, immediately following the conclusion of the informal interactive dialogue (in Conference Room 4), in order to enable the President of the General Assembly to make a concluding statement and formally close the High-level Dialogue.
E. Multi-stakeholder round tables
On the morning of Tuesday, 28 June, six interactive multi-stakeholder round tables, divided into two sessions, each comprising three simultaneous round tables, will be held as outlined below.
The first set of three simultaneous round tables will be held on Tuesday, 28 June, from 10 a.m. to 11.30 a.m., on the following themes:
• Round table 1: Mobilizing domestic financial resources for development

Each round table will be chaired by two chairpersons to be appointed by the President of the General Assembly from among the ministers attending the High-level Dialogue, including those nominated by the regional groups.
The President of the General Assembly may also invite heads of relevant institutional stakeholders to act as lead discussants in the round tables.
Each round table will be open to the participation of 35 representatives of Governments; seven representatives of observers, entities of the United Nations system and accredited institutional stakeholders; three representatives of accredited civil society organizations and three representatives of accredited business sector entities.
Informal interactive dialogue
The informal interactive dialogue, chaired by the President of the General Assembly, will be held on the afternoon of Tuesday, 28 June, in the form of an informal meeting with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.
It will focus on the implementation of the results of the International Conference on Financing for Development and the link between financing for development and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration.2 The heads or representatives of relevant organizations of the United Nations system, regional and international intergovernmental organs that participated in the International Conference on Financing for Development, as well as representatives of regional development banks, civil society and the business sector, will be able to intervene.
To provide for a free-flowing, interactive discussion, no list of speakers will be established.
The President of the General Assembly will call upon participants, in the order in which they signify their desire to speak, on the understanding that the principle of precedence will be strictly applied, to allow participation at the ministerial level.
The Chairpersons of the round tables and other participants may wish to refer to the outcomes of the discussions in the round tables.
All participants will be invited to speak from their seats and will be strongly encouraged to avoid reading from written statements.
