Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Revised budget for the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Mandate and planned results
The mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000.
By its resolution 1565 (2004) of 1 October 2004, the Security Council extended the deployment of MONUC until 31 March 2005, authorized the increase of the Mission's strength by 5,900 personnel, including up to 341 civilian police personnel, as well as the deployment of appropriate civilian personnel, appropriate and proportionate air mobility assets and other force enablers and decided that MONUC would have the mandate set out in paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of the resolution.
The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to maintain international peace and security in the region.
Within this overall objective, MONUC will, during the budget period, contribute to the expected accomplishments, which have been reviewed by the General Assembly in the context of the Mission's initial 2004/05 budget (A/58/701) and remain unchanged, by delivering related key outputs.
The frameworks below are grouped by components: peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the Transitional Government and elections; rule of law; and the human dimension of sustainable peace and support.
They show additional outputs to be produced with the proposed additional resources, and indicate additional contributions to the same expected accomplishments defined in the Mission's initial 2004/05 budget, which are included in the present report for ease of reference.
The additional contributions can be measured through the previously formulated indicators of achievements identified as “no change”, as well as additional or revised indicators of achievement.
The human resources of the Mission in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the Mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Mission as a whole.
Additional human resource requirements compared with the initial 2004/05 budget, including redeployments and reclassifications, have been explained under the respective components.
The Mission is headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the Under-Secretary-General level, who is assisted by two Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, both at the Assistant Secretary-General level.
Reporting directly to the Special Representative are the Force Commander, at the Assistant Secretary-General level, and the Director of Administration (D-2).
The civilian police establishment of the Mission is headed by a Civilian Police Commissioner (D-1), who reports to the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1565 (2004), MONUC has adjusted its military concept of operations, with force deployment concentrated in the east of the country.
In order to reflect the tasks set out by the Council in paragraphs 4 and 5 of its resolution 1565 (2004), the Mission will deploy three (including two additional) brigade-size contingents, which would constitute the Eastern Division, to the Ituri region (Bunia), South Kivu (Bukavu) and North Kivu (Goma), with the divisional headquarters established in Kisangani under the command of a Divisional Commander (D-2).
In addition, two battalions positioned in Kinshasa and Kisangani will act as force and divisional reserves, respectively.
The Mission's logistical concept of operations has also been adjusted with a view to establishing, operating and maintaining additional infrastructure and providing the necessary communications, mobility and sustainment capabilities essential to support the reconfigured deployment of the military force.
The Mission headquarters will continue its operations from the capital, Kinshasa, where the Offices of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Force Commander are located.
Support facilities and administrative and technical services will be provided to substantive, military and civilian police personnel from the Mission headquarters, the Kisangani divisional administrative headquarters, the 6 regional offices and 30 field locations where Mission personnel are deployed, including the significantly expanded Bunia, Bukavu and Goma offices, as well as the logistics bases in Bunia, Entebbe (Uganda), Kinshasa and Kigoma (United Republic of Tanzania).
Executive direction and management
Overall mission direction and management are to be provided by the immediate Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.

a Represents estimated rental value of field offices headquarters and air terminal in Kinshasa.
Analysis of variances
• Mandate: change in scale and scope of mandate
The main factor contributing to the variance of $110 701,600 under this heading is the additional requirements in connection with the deployment of the additional 5,674 military contingent personnel and the sustainment of the resulting increased military force of 15,714 personnel.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $1,875,000 under this heading is the proposed increase in the number of United Nations Volunteers by 115 Volunteers (from 490 to 605).
The estimated resource requirements take into account the phased deployment of the additional Volunteers and reflect the application of a 10 per cent vacancy factor to the computation of living allowance requirements.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $51,900 under this heading is the requirement for the specialized services of an Engineer/Architect in connection with construction projects at Mission headquarters.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $1,467,400 under this heading is increased requirements in connection with pre-deployment inspection travel to troop-contributing countries, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations assessment/review mission pursuant to a request contained in paragraph 8 of Security Council resolution 1565 (2004), the electoral assessment and planning mission, as well as within-mission travel related to the administrative and logistical support to military contingent personnel, implementation of the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, resettlement or reintegration and HIV/AIDS programmes, election-related activities, human rights investigations and humanitarian assessment missions.
• Mandate: change in scale and scope of mandate
The main factors contributing to the variance of $35,864,600 under this heading are the requirements for the upgrading and rehabilitation of airfields in the mission area, establishment of the Divisional and Brigade headquarters in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and self-sustainment requirements in respect of the additional 5,674 military contingent personnel.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $20,779,400 under this heading is the requirement for the acquisition of additional 4x4 off-the-road and armoured vehicles, ambulances, trucks, material-handling equipment and airfield support vehicles to support the additional military contingents, as well as civilian and police personnel at various locations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
• Mandate: change in scope and scale of mandate
The main factor contributing to the variance of $37,344,600 under this heading is the deployment of the additional 26 aircraft (6 fixed-wing and 20 helicopters) in support of the military contingents and the corresponding additional requirements for operating costs, combined with a 16.5 per cent increase in the cost of aviation fuel.
The proposed configuration of the Mission's fleet of 77 aircraft (29 fixed-wing and 48 helicopters) takes into account logistical support requirements arising from the deployment of additional military contingents to the North and South Kivus and the Ituri region.
The Mission's fleet of 6 additional fixed-wing aircraft would comprise 3 short take-off and landing passenger aircraft, 1 medium cargo short take-off and landing aircraft and 2 C-130 military transport aircraft provided under letter-of-assist arrangements.
The Mission's fleet of additional 20 helicopters would consist of 4 attack, 6 military utility and 4 light surveillance helicopters provided under letter-of-assist arrangements, as well as 2 heavy cargo, 2 light observation and 2 medium utility search-and-rescue capable helicopters.
• Mandate: change in scope and scale of mandate
The main factors contributing to the variance of $27,959,500 under this heading are the self-sustainment requirements for the additional 5,674 military contingent personnel and the requirement for the additional VHF/UHF, HF and satellite equipment, telephone switching and miscellaneous communications equipment to support the Kisangani Divisional and Brigade headquarters, logistics base in Entebbe (Uganda) and newly established 9 offices throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $10,920,400 under this heading is the requirement for additional desktop computers and monitors, portable computers, printers, servers, uninterruptible power supply units and network routers and switchers needed to support the additional military personnel, civilian police officers and additional civilian personnel in connection with the establishment of the Kisangani Divisional and Brigade headquarters, logistics base in Entebbe (Uganda) and the nine newly established offices throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
• Mandate: change in scope and scale of mandate
The main factor contributing to the variance of $1,243,700 under this heading is the self-sustainment requirements for the additional 5,674 military contingents personnel.
• Mandate: change in scope and scale of mandate
The main factor contributing to the variance of $1,255,700 under this heading is the self-sustainment requirements for the additional 5,674 military contingents personnel.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $3,425,400 under this heading is additional requirements in respect of air and surface freight in connection with the transportation of contingent-owned equipment within the theatre of operations.
Actions to be taken by the General Assembly
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of MONUC are:

Summary
In its resolution 58/259 B of 18 June 2004, the General Assembly appropriated for the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) an amount of $746,072,500 for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 inclusive of the amount of $709,123,200 for the maintenance of the Mission, $30,207,700 for the support account for peacekeeping operations and $6,741,600 for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy.
Resources approved by the Assembly for the Mission provided for its maintenance based on the concept of operations and authorized troop and civilian police strength approved by the Security Council in its resolution 1493 (2004) of 28 July 2004.
Subsequently, the Security Council, in its resolution 1565 (2004) of 1 October 2004, extended the deployment of MONUC until 31 March 2005, authorized the increase of MONUC strength by 5,900 personnel, including up to 341 civilian police personnel, as well as the deployment of appropriate civilian personnel, appropriate and proportionate air mobility assets and other force enablers, and decided that MONUC would have the mandate set out in paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of the resolution.
Pending submission of the Mission's revised 2004/05 budget to the General Assembly, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in a letter from its Chairman dated 8 December 2004 addressed to the Secretary-General, concurred in the Controller's request to enter into commitments for MONUC in the amount not exceeding $49,950,000 in order to meet the immediate additional logistical and military personnel requirements of the Mission.
The present report contains the revised budget for MONUC for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, which amounts to $962,012,400, exclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions in kind in the amount of $3,067,100, representing an increase of $252,889,200 from the amount of $709,123,200 appropriated by the General Assembly in its resolution 58/259 B for the maintenance of the Mission for the same period.
It should be read in conjunction with the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of MONUC of 3 February 2004 (A/58/701) containing the Mission's initial 2004/05 budget.
The revised budget provides for the deployment of additional 5,674 military contingent personnel, 86 civilian police personnel, 190 international staff, 393 national staff, including 11 national officers, and 115 United Nations Volunteers for a total revised strength of 760 military observers, 15,714 military contingent personnel, 268 civilian police officers, 1,162 international staff, 1,747 national staff, including 36 national officers, and 605 United Nations Volunteers.
The revised resource requirements of MONUC have been linked to the Mission's objective through a number of results-based frameworks, grouped by the components set out in its initial 2004/05 budget (A/58/701): peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Transitional Government and elections, rule of law, the human dimension of sustainable peace and support, which remain unchanged.
Accordingly, in the framework components already reviewed by the General Assembly, the present report reflects only additional or revised indicators of achievement and outputs.
The additional human resources of the Mission in terms of number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the Mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Mission as a whole.
The explanations of variances in resource levels, both human resources and financial resources, have been linked, where applicable, to specific outputs planned by the Mission.

Reference
This Section describes the single largest contributing factor of each resource variance according to specific standard options encompassed in the four standard categories listed below:
Mandate:Variances caused by changes in the scale or scope of the mandate, or changes in the expected accomplishments as driven by the mandate;
External:Variances caused by parties or situations external to the United Nations;
Cost parameters:Variances caused by United Nations regulations, rules and policies;
Management:Variances caused by management actions to achieve planned results more effectively (e.g. by reprioritizing or adding certain outputs) or efficiently (e.g. by taking measures to reduce personnel or operational inputs while maintaining the same level of outputs), and/or from performance-related issues (e.g. by having underestimated the costs or quantities of inputs required to produce a certain level of outputs, or by delayed recruitment).
