Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Introduction
The present report is the thirteenth consolidated report on the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, and is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/54 of 8 December 2003.
Pursuant to the recommendations of the 2003 Group of Governmental Experts, the Department for Disarmament Affairs engaged in a number of activities to enhance awareness of the Register and to encourage greater participation in it.
The Register was discussed in the “African Regional Conference on Transparency”, organized by the Department, through its Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, which was held in Bamako, Mali, from 26 to 30 July 2004.
The Register was also discussed in a regional workshop on the theme “Small arms and light weapons for the South Pacific” organized by the Department through its Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, which was held in Nadi, Fiji, from 18-20 August 2004, covering the Member States of the Pacific Islands Forum.
On 25 April 2005, the Department made a presentation on the Register in a plenary session of the Committee on Hemispheric Security of the Organization of American States held in Washington, D.C.
The Register was also the focus of attention at a regional workshop organized by the Department in Nairobi, Kenya, from 31 May to 2 June 2005.
The workshop, which was sponsored by the Governments of the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, covered the Member States from the Horn of Africa and Great Lakes regions and Southern Africa.
In September 2004, the Department published an updated version of its information booklet on the Register, which was printed by the Government of the United Kingdom.

As regards the information contained in the table, it should be noted that a “yes” denotes a submission of data regarding imports and/or exports in relation to the seven categories of arms covered by the Register during the reporting period.
