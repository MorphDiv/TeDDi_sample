Work of the fifty-sixth session
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, addressed the Committee as guest speaker.
He spoke of the outcome of the “Millennium Summit” and its relevance to humanitarian objectives.
World leaders had endorsed the role of the United Nations in humanitarian action and the need for it to be equipped for swift and predictable responses to humanitarian crises.
The return of refugees and internally displaced persons was critical in sustaining peace processes and the Secretary-General welcomed the High Commissioner's intention that UNHCR play a proactive role in the future work of the Peacebuilding Support Office, which would be put in motion before the end of 2005.
The Millennium Summit had advanced the agenda of the international community's response to internal displacement, although developing a more predictable response remained a challenge.
The new partnerships and distribution of tasks put forward by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee were a promising step.
The Secretary-General applauded the commitment by the High Commissioner to take the lead role in protection, emergency shelter and camp coordination in situations of internal displacement, while noting this expanded role should not detract from UNHCR's role with regard to refugees.
The Secretary-General urged Member States to support UNHCR in this endeavour, including through ensuring that the Central Emergency Revolving Fund was adequately funded to guarantee the quick release of funds in emergencies.
It had been an intellectual breakthrough that Member States now accepted the links between security, development and human rights.
The Secretary-General also highlighted the acceptance by Member States of the concept of the responsibility to protect, with a focus on early conflict prevention.
The Secretary-General thought that the new standing Human Rights Council could help ensure a more effective protection response and believed the United Nations High Commissioners for Human Rights and Refugees could reinforce each other's operational as well as policy work.
Finally, the Secretary-General considered that the recently released recommendations of the Global Commission on Migration required close analysis and reflection.
The High Commissioner delivered an opening statement as the basis for the general debate.
He called on the international community to join forces to fight intolerance, preserve the institution of asylum, and bridge the gap between humanitarian relief and long-term development.
Stressing that UNHCR was above all a refugee protection agency and that all staff members must see themselves as agents of protection, the High Commissioner reviewed key UNHCR operations, focused on UNHCR's role as a fully engaged partner in the collaborative approach of the United Nations in addressing internal displacement and examined the ongoing challenges of preserving asylum, especially in the context of mixed migration flows.
UNHCR needed strong partnerships and a healthy funding base, as well as transparency, accountability and structural reform.
The full text of the High Commissioner's statement is available on UNHCR's website (www.unhcr.ch).
A summary of the ensuing general debate, provided by the Chairman, is found in annex II to the present report.
The High Commissioner was joined in a panel discussion on the inter-agency collaboration response to internal displacement situations by His Excellency Mr. Theophile Mbemba Fundu, Minister of the Interior of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Jan Egeland.

(n) Notes UNHCR's global priorities relating to refugee children; calls on States to support the efforts of UNHCR in ensuring that the needs of refugee children, particularly unaccompanied and separated children, are fully met through their identification and registration, and through UNHCR's overall protection and assistance activities, including management support, training and monitoring activities; and reminds UNHCR of Goal 2, Objective 2 of the Agenda for Protection regarding the convening of an experts meeting focusing on the protection needs of trafficked children;
(o) Stresses the importance of States intensifying their efforts, in cooperation with UNHCR and other relevant organizations, to ensure that all refugee children benefit from education, consistent with the Millennium Development Goals, and that such education pays due regard, as appropriate, to their cultural identity while facilitating a greater understanding of the country of asylum;
(p) Acknowledges the important contribution of the age and gender and diversity mainstreaming strategy in identifying, through a participatory approach, the protection risks faced by the different members of the refugee community; encourages UNHCR and its NGO partners to continue to roll out and implement on the ground this important strategy, as a means to promote the rights and well-being of all refugees, in particular the non-discriminatory treatment and protection of refugee women and refugee children and minority groups of refugees; and looks forward to learning more on UNHCR's intentions regarding diversity;

Conclusion on the provision on international protection, including through complementary forms of protection
The Executive Committee,
Reaffirming that the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees together with its 1967 Protocol continue to serve as the cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime; and noting in this regard the fundamental importance of their full application by State Parties, including that of the fundamental principle of non-refoulement,
Recognizing that, in different contexts, there may be a need for international protection in cases not addressed by the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol; and recalling in this regard paragraph (l) of its Conclusion No. 74 (XLV),
Reaffirming the principle that all human beings shall enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination, including the right to seek and enjoy asylum,
Underlining the value of regional instruments, as and where applicable, including notably the 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, as well as the 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees, which include among refugees persons who cannot return to their countries due to indiscriminate threats resulting from situations such as generalized violence, armed conflict or events seriously disturbing public order, and the asylum legislation adopted by the European Union, which recognizes certain international protection needs beyond the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol,
Recalling that international and regional instruments to address the problem of statelessness, such as the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, where applicable, are important tools for State Parties to use, in particular to avoid and resolve situations of statelessness and, where necessary, to further the protection of stateless persons,
Acknowledging that in many countries a number of administrative or legislative mechanisms are in place for regularizing, on a variety of grounds, the stay of persons, including those who may not be eligible for refugee protection but who may be in need of international protection,
Noting the value of establishing general principles upon which complementary forms of protection for those in need of international protection may be based, on the persons who might benefit from it, and on the compatibility of these forms of protection with the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol and other relevant international and regional instruments,
(a) Urges State Parties to implement their obligations under the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol fully and effectively in accordance with the object and purpose of these instruments;
(b) Calls upon State Parties to interpret the criteria for refugee status in the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol in such a manner that all persons who fulfil these criteria are duly recognized and protected under those instruments, rather than being accorded a complementary form of protection;
(c) Recognizes that refugee law is a dynamic body of law based on the obligations of State Parties to the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol and, where applicable, on regional refugee protection instruments, and which is informed by the object and purpose of these instruments and by developments in related areas of international law, such as human rights and international humanitarian law bearing directly on refugee protection;
(d) Reiterates the need to ensure that the integrity of the asylum system is not abused by the extension of refugee protection to those who are not entitled to it and to apply scrupulously the exclusion clauses stipulated in Article 1F of the 1951 Convention and in other relevant international instruments;
(e) Calls on the State Parties to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness to apply these instruments in good faith, bearing in mind their protection objectives; and requests UNHCR actively to promote accession to these instruments;
(f) Calls on States to make maximum use of existing protection instruments when addressing international protection needs; and encourages States that have not already done so to consider accession to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol and to relevant, applicable regional instruments and/or to consider lifting existing limitations or withdrawing reservations in order to ensure the widest possible application of the protection principles they contain;
(g) Calls upon all State Parties, as applicable, to adopt the necessary national legislation or procedures to give effect to regional refugee instruments;
(h) Acknowledges that complementary forms of protection provided by States to ensure that persons in need of international protection actually receive it are a positive way of responding pragmatically to certain international protection needs;
(i) Encourages the use of complementary forms of protection for individuals in need of international protection who do not meet the refugee definition under the 1951 Convention or the 1967 Protocol;
(j) Realizes that States may decide to allow prolonged stay for compassionate or practical reasons; and recognizes that such cases must be clearly distinguished from cases where there are international protection needs;
(k) Affirms that measures to provide complementary protection should be implemented in a manner that strengthens, rather than undermines, the existing international refugee protection regime;
(l) Notes that temporary protection, without formally according refugee status, as a specific provisional protection response to situations of mass influx providing immediate emergency protection from refoulement, should be clearly distinguished from other forms of international protection;
(m) Affirms that relevant international treaty obligations, where applicable, prohibiting refoulement represent important protection tools to address the protection needs of persons who are outside their country of origin and who may be of concern to UNHCR but who may not fulfil the refugee definition under the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol; and calls upon States to respect the fundamental principle of non-refoulement;
(n) Encourages States, in granting complementary forms of protection to those persons in need of it, to provide for the highest degree of stability and certainty by ensuring the human rights and fundamental freedoms of such persons without discrimination, taking into account the relevant international instruments and giving due regard to the best interest of the child and family unity principles;
(o) Recommends that, where it is appropriate to consider the ending of complementary forms of protection, States adopt criteria which are objective and clearly and publicly enunciated; and notes that the doctrine and procedural standards developed in relation to the cessation clauses of article 1.C of the 1951 Convention may offer helpful guidance in this regard;
(p) Notes that States may choose to consult with UNHCR, if appropriate, in view of its particular expertise and mandate, when they are considering granting or ending a form of complementary protection to persons who fall within the competence of the Office;
(q) Encourages States to consider whether it may be appropriate to establish a comprehensive procedure before a central expert authority making a single decision which allows the assessment of refugee status followed by other international protection needs, as a means of assessing all international protection needs without undermining refugee protection and while recognizing the need for a flexible approach to the procedures applied;
(r) Notes that, where applicable, in considering a comprehensive procedure, the applicable procedure should be fair and efficient;
(s) Underlines the importance of applying and developing the international refugee protection system in a way which avoids protection gaps and enables all those in need of international protection to find and enjoy it.
C. Conclusion on local integration
The Executive Committee,
Reaffirming that voluntary repatriation, local integration and resettlement are the traditional durable solutions, and that all remain viable and important responses to refugee situations; reiterating that voluntary repatriation, in safety and dignity, where and when feasible, remains the most preferred solution in the majority of refugee situations; noting that a combination of solutions, taking into account the specific circumstances of each refugee situation, can help achieve lasting solutions; and agreeing that local integration is a sovereign decision and an option to be exercised by States guided by their treaty obligations and human rights principles, and that the provisions of this Conclusion are for the guidance of States and UNHCR when local integration is to be considered,
Recalling the Agenda for Protection Goal 5, Objective 4 requesting the Executive Committee to set out framework considerations for implementing the solution of local integration in the form of a Conclusion; and noting that the provisions of this Conclusion are intended to guide States in their consideration of whether local integration, taking into account the specific circumstances of each refugee situation, may be an appropriate durable solution for persons accepted as refugees in their territory pursuant to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, or under the 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, or the 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees, or under domestic law, as applicable, as well as when implementing it,
Recalling that the ultimate goal of international protection is to achieve durable solutions for refugees; and noting that a solutions orientation is inherent in General Assembly resolution 428 (V) of 14 December 1950 adopting the Statute of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in the Statute itself, and in the 1951 Convention through its provisions on cessation, integration and naturalization,
Considering that refugee situations are international in scope and nature and therefore reiterating its strong commitment to international solidarity and burden and responsibility sharing; and reaffirming UNHCR's catalytic role in assisting and supporting countries receiving refugees, particularly developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and in mobilizing financial assistance and other forms of support, including development assistance from the international community to address the impact of large-scale refugee populations,
Acknowledging that the global refugee situation represents an international challenge requiring international burden and responsibility sharing to be addressed effectively; and, recognizing that allowing for local integration, where applicable, is an act of States which is a durable solution for refugees that contributes to that burden and responsibility sharing, without prejudice to the specific situation of certain developing countries facing mass influxes,
Reiterating that coordinated national and international efforts aimed at addressing the factors that lead to the flow of refugees should continue,
Expressing appreciation for the efforts made in recent years to redouble the search for durable solutions in the context of the Global Consultations on International Protection and of the Agenda for Protection, which fostered, inter alia, the Convention Plus initiative and the Framework for Durable Solutions,
Recognizing that some countries of asylum carry a heavy burden, in particular developing countries, countries with economies in transition and least developed countries which host large numbers of refugees and asylum-seekers, especially when they have arrived as part of a mass influx and have remained for a long period of time,
Noting that local integration in the refugee context is a dynamic and multifaceted two-way process, which requires efforts by all parties concerned, including a preparedness on the part of refugees to adapt to the host society without having to forego their own cultural identity, and a corresponding readiness on the part of host communities and public institutions to welcome refugees and to meet the needs of a diverse population,
Recognizing that local integration needs to be undertaken in a manner that sustains the viability of local communities affected by the presence of refugees and that a failure to do so may result in an unreasonable burden being placed on host countries,
Affirming the value of strengthening capacities in host countries as well as of initiatives enhancing the ability of refugee communities to become self-reliant, as and when appropriate, with adequate support from the international community for the host country and the refugees living there,
Recognizing that promoting the self-reliance of refugees from the outset will contribute towards enhancing their protection and dignity, help refugees manage their time spent in exile effectively and constructively, decrease dependency and enhance the sustainability of any future durable solution,
Recognizing the positive contributions, including economic benefits, which refugees who integrate locally or who are allowed to become self-reliant could make to host countries and communities,
Recalling Executive Committee Conclusion No. 15, that decisions by States with regard to the granting of asylum shall be made without discrimination as to race, religion, political opinion or membership of a particular social group, nationality or country of origin; and acknowledging in this context that integration potential should not be a criterion for granting asylum,
(a) Recognizes that the provisions of this Conclusion are intended to guide States in their consideration of whether local integration may be an appropriate durable solution for persons accepted as refugees in their territory pursuant to the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol, or under the 1969 OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, or the 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees, or under domestic law, as applicable, as well as when implementing it;
(b) Acknowledges the importance of comprehensive approaches especially for the resolution of protracted and large-scale refugee situations, which incorporate, as appropriate and given the specifics of each refugee situation, voluntary repatriation, local integration and resettlement;
(c) Encourages States, UNHCR and other relevant actors to engage in consultations to develop, as early on as possible in a refugee situation, comprehensive arrangements that draw upon appropriate solutions, including through a combination of solutions, and which recognize the challenges involved with the timing and sequencing of solutions; and emphasizes the important place which local integration can have in such comprehensive arrangements;
(d) Notes that the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol set out rights and minimum standards for the treatment of refugees that are geared towards the process of integration; recognizes the need for State Parties to implement their obligations under these instruments fully and effectively; and therefore encourages State Parties maintaining reservations to consider withdrawing them; and calls on States to facilitate, as appropriate, the integration of refugees, including, as far as possible, through facilitating their naturalization;
(e) Encourages States, UNHCR and other relevant actors when preparing comprehensive arrangements to consider the characteristics of individuals and groups of refugees within a broader refugee population who could benefit from voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement;
(f) Urges States and UNHCR to continue working proactively on local integration where appropriate and feasible and in a manner that takes into account the needs and views of both refugees and their hosting communities;
(g) Notes that the criteria for identifying refugees who could benefit from local integration should be clear and objective and be applied in a non-discriminatory manner;
(h) Reaffirms the importance, in this respect, of registration, or ad hoc surveys where these take place, as a means of facilitating the implementation of appropriate durable solutions; and encourages States and UNHCR to utilize the registration data of refugees in this process, in a manner that fully respects international norms and standards regarding the protection of personal data;
(i) Notes that characteristics which may assist in determining circumstances in which local integration can be an appropriate durable solution could include, subject to States' consideration:
(i) refugees born in asylum countries who might otherwise become stateless; and/or
(ii) refugees who, due to their personal circumstances including the reasons prompting their flight, are unlikely to be able to repatriate to their country of origin in the foreseeable future; and/or
(iii) refugees who have established close family, social, cultural and economic links with their country of asylum, including those who already have, or have the capacity to attain, a considerable degree of socio-economic integration;
(j) Welcomes the practice in States with developed asylum systems of allowing refugees to integrate locally; and calls on these States to continue supporting refugees' ability to attain this durable solution through the timely grant of a secure legal status and residency rights, and/or to facilitate naturalization;
(k) Acknowledges that the process of local integration is complex and gradual, comprising three distinct but interrelated legal, economic, and social and cultural dimensions, all of which are important for refugees' ability to integrate successfully as fully included members of society; and notes that refugees' understanding of these dimensions may need to be facilitated through proper counselling and advice;
(l) Affirms the particular importance of the legal dimension of integration, which entails the host State granting refugees a secure legal status and a progressively wider range of rights and entitlements that are broadly commensurate with those enjoyed by its citizens and, over time, the possibility of naturalizing, and in this respect:
(i) recognizes the relevance of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol and relevant human rights instruments as providing a useful legal framework for guiding the local integration process;
(ii) recognizes further that in support of the legal process, host countries may need technical and financial support to adapt and revise their national legal and administrative frameworks to allow refugees equal enjoyment of rights, services and programmes without discrimination;
(m) Notes the important part, subject to States' consideration, self-reliance plays in the economic dimension of local integration of refugees whereby individuals, households and communities are enabled increasingly to become self-sufficient and can contribute to the local economy, and in this respect:
(i) recognizes that the protection, in all States, of basic civil, economic and social rights, including freedom of movement and the right to engage in income-generating activities is essential to the achievement of self-reliance of refugees;
(ii) encourages all States hosting refugees to consider ways in which refugee employment and active participation in the economic life of the host country can be facilitated, inter alia, through education and skills development, and to examine their laws and practices, with a view to identifying and to removing, to the extent possible, existing obstacles to refugee employment; and in this regard, affirms the relevance of the 1951 Convention in providing a framework for the creation of conditions conducive to the self-reliance of refugees;
(iii) encourages States, wherever possible, to recognize the equivalency of academic, professional and vocational diplomas, certificates and degrees acquired by refugees prior to entry into the host country;
(iv) notes that facilitating refugees' access to agricultural land in rural areas where appropriate and when feasible is a positive contribution by all States, which can help foster opportunities for self-reliance and enhance the food security of refugees and the local population;
(n) Emphasizes that the social and cultural dimension of local integration requires refugees to make conscientious efforts to adapt to the local environment and respect and understand new cultures and lifestyles, taking into consideration the values of the local population, and requires the host community to accept refugees into its sociocultural fabric, both processes being underpinned by values of diversity, non-discrimination and tolerance, and in this respect:
(i) encourages the implementation of anti-discrimination policies and awareness-raising activities aimed at combating institutionalized discrimination and at promoting the positive aspects of a diverse society and interaction between refugees, the local population, civil society and refugee organizations;
(ii) urges States and all relevant actors to combat intolerance, racism and xenophobia, including obstacles faced by refugee women, and to foster empathy and understanding through public statements, appropriate legislation and social policies, especially with regard to the special situation of refugees with the aim of allowing refugees to participate actively in the civic, economic, and social and cultural life of the host country;
(iii) recognizes the link between education and durable solutions; and calls on States, UNHCR and relevant actors to strengthen their efforts to assist host countries in ensuring refugee children's access to education;
(iv) reaffirms the importance of family unity and reunification as referred to in its Conclusions Nos. 9, 24, 84, and 88; and recognizes that family members can reinforce the social support system of refugees, and in so doing, promote the smoother and more rapid integration of refugee families;
(o) Emphasizes that age and gender sensitive approaches, and attention to participatory and community development processes should permeate all activities aimed at enhancing the capacities of refugees to integrate locally, recognizing changes in gender roles following displacement and the need for different strategies and support to boost the integration capacity of various groups with special needs, such as refugee women, refugee children and older refugees;
(p) Encourages UNHCR to develop and apply appropriate standards and indicators that account for age and gender considerations in local integration and self-reliance programmes;
(q) Acknowledges that, regardless of whether local integration takes place in an industrialized or a developing State, it requires the host State to take the lead role, as well as the sustained commitment of all stakeholders of the necessary time and resources; and recognizes the important role which members of civil society, including non-governmental organizations, can play in fostering an environment conducive to local integration;
(r) Recognizes the importance, in the interest of burden and responsibility sharing, of international cooperation and assistance for building the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition with limited resources so as to assist these States in integrating refugees locally, where appropriate and feasible; and recommends that the planning, design and implementation of local integration programmes include elements aimed at strengthening the capacity of host State institutions, local communities, and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, refugees and their communities;
(s) Stresses the importance of including refugee hosting areas in national development plans and strategies of the host country for sustainable funding; notes the relevance, in this respect, of the common country assessments and United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAF), as well as poverty reduction strategy papers; and notes the value of the development through local integration integrated programming approach as a methodology for partnerships with donor countries, financial institutions and with United Nations and other development agencies.

Annex II
Chairman's summary of the general debate
Our discussions have been considerably influenced by the current climate of reform in the United Nations system, which is likely to have considerable impact on the humanitarian sector.
New opportunities are arising that could address some of the root causes of forced displacement and offer new hope for durable solutions.
They include the creation of a Peacebuilding Commission, proposed by the Secretary-General and broadly welcomed as an important step towards conflict resolution in many areas of the world.
Then there are the efforts to strengthen the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, thereby alleviating some of the major causes of mass displacement.
We commended the efforts already deployed by UNHCR to forge closer links with development agencies while retaining its distinct, humanitarian vocation.
There was unanimous support for the High Commissioner in reaffirming protection as being the core function of his Office.
Many of us expressed alarm at growing signs of intolerance and distrust in our societies.
We rejected the tendency to equate asylum-seekers with criminals, even terrorists, and deplored the harmful exploitation of this confusion by certain populist elements.
Several delegates echoed the High Commissioner's own words that asylum is “a central tenet of democracy”.
There was also clear recognition that any wilful abuse of the asylum system by persons not entitled to international protection should be strongly resisted.
We expressed our support for the creation of a new post of Assistant High Commissioner for protection as part of a broader restructuring intended to strengthen UNHCR's protection work, particularly in the field.
Delegates also looked forward to continued discussion on how to further improve the delivery of protection and to an evaluation of the impact of the new structure after two years.
Specific protection activities that were mentioned as important were those in favour of refugee women, children, the elderly, as well as the victims of AIDS.
Registration was also singled out as an important protection tool, with specific examples from various refugee-hosting States.
Several delegations also drew attention to the importance of resettlement as a protection tool, giving examples of programmes under way to provide more resettlement opportunities.
Delegates welcomed the priority given by the new High Commissioner to Africa, as clearly demonstrated by his first field visits.
We also took note of several encouraging developments in that continent, allowing the voluntary repatriation of sizeable numbers of refugees.
But we agreed that there was no call for complacency.
Many protracted situations remain, with little prospect of early solutions.
The situation in Darfur remains of gravest concern.
One delegation described it as “a blot on our conscience”.
We urgently called for the belligerents involved to halt the violence that has already caused so much suffering in the Sudan and neighbouring Chad, and earnestly hoped that the upcoming talks would help towards a cessation of the brutal attacks and an end to this terrible tragedy.
The importance of identifying durable solutions was underlined by many delegations.
In this context, we welcomed the plans announced by the High Commissioner to mainstream the Convention Plus activities.
We felt that some of these activities had been useful, notably the resettlement framework and the guide on targeting development.
However, some delegations considered that a more practical focus was now needed, oriented to specific field situations.
They expressed the wish for further clarification and to be kept informed as progress was made in mainstreaming such activities.
Several delegations commented on the issue of local integration, acknowledging the difficulties that accompany this solution in some countries, while considering that some useful guidance on this matter could be offered to States as part of a holistic approach to resolving certain protracted situations.
One of the major themes of our general debate was that of internally displaced persons, which was also the subject of the panel discussion, at which we had the privilege of hearing the views of Mr. Theophile Mbemba Fundu, the Minister of the Interior of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Mr. Jan Egeland, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.
Delegates agreed that internally displaced persons are among the most neglected in terms of support from the international community.
That support, when it exists, has been unpredictable and uneven.
In the case of Latin America, in particular, several delegations commented on the need for increased attention and resources to address the needs of this category of victims.
We therefore welcomed the efforts now under way to correct these deficiencies through a collaborative, inter-agency approach, in which UNHCR would be responsible for leading clusters of agencies with expertise in, respectively, protection, emergency shelter and camp coordination/management.
While expressing support for this team-based, collaborative approach, delegations as well as the High Commissioner underlined that this additional responsibility should not be to the detriment of UNHCR's core mandate for refugees, and that additional resources should be available in order for UNHCR to carry out such commitments.
Delegations looked forward to continuing close consultations with the High Commissioner on the policy and financial implications of UNHCR's contribution to the collaborative approach.
Turning now to UNHCR's management, we expressed global support for the new directions taken by the High Commissioner, including his measures to strengthen the Office of the Inspector General and ensure its independence, and his announced objective to reinforce UNHCR's policy formulation and evaluation function.
We also recognized that good progress has been made towards results-based management and we encouraged him to pursue this further in the interest of transparency and accountability.
Several delegations also paid tribute to the courage and dedication of staff living and working in difficult situations in the field, and urged that their security must remain a top priority.
We stressed that adequate funding continues to be a major challenge, in the context of a projected shortfall for the current year's budget.
Many delegations, especially those from major refugee-hosting countries, or from countries of return, devastated by years of war, faced with the needs of vast numbers of displaced persons, drew attention to the urgent need for moral and financial support from the international community.
Some delegations observed that the situation in some countries was deteriorating, and that food supplies were critical.
We urged the High Commissioner to continue his efforts to broaden and diversify the donor base, and renewed our appeal to the international community to show sustained solidarity and generosity in sharing the burden.
See summary records of the session for a full account of the deliberations of the Committee, including the statements or other interventions by delegations under all agenda items, and their comments on the draft conclusions and decisions, as well as the closing statements by the High Commissioner and the Chairman.
This conclusion addresses only the situation of persons who fall under the mandate of UNHCR.
