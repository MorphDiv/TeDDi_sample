In connection with this item, the Assembly has before it a letter dated 2 September 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Slovenia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly (A/59/908).
In the letter, the Permanent Representative of Slovenia, on behalf of the member States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, requests that the consideration of this sub-item be postponed to the sixtieth session of the General Assembly and that it be included in the draft agenda of that session, with the understanding that, without setting a precedent, this sub-item will again fall under the item entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations”, which is to be included in the agenda of the sixty-first session and which will be considered biennially, pursuant to Assembly resolution 55/285 of 7 September 2001.
Bearing in mind the understanding stated in the letter, may I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to defer consideration of sub-item (n) of agenda item 56 and to include it in the draft agenda of the sixtieth session?
It was so decided.
The President (spoke in French): May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (n) of agenda item 56 and of agenda item 56 as a whole?

It is my understanding that it would be preferable for the Assembly to consider the report at its sixtieth session.
In that connection, may I therefore take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to defer consideration of this item and to include it in the draft agenda of its sixtieth session?

The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan
The President (spoke in French): Members will recall that at its 46th plenary meeting, on 29 October 2004, the Assembly decided to include this item in the agenda of the fifty-ninth session.
It is my understanding that the sponsor of this item has requested that the consideration of this item be deferred to the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.
I give the floor to the representative of Armenia, who wishes to speak in explanation of position before a decision is taken.
Mr. Martirosyan (Armenia): Almost one year ago, agenda item 163 was included in the agenda of the General Assembly on the pretext of urgency.
At that time, Armenia unequivocally opposed the introduction of the item, stating clearly that all allegations levelled against Armenia were false, and suggested facilitating the dispatch of a fact-finding mission to assess the situation.
A fact-finding mission was launched by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the results were made available to all Member States represented at the United Nations.
It clearly affirmed what Armenia had been stating all along: first, that overall settlement is quite limited and, secondly, that there is no clear organized resettlement, no non-voluntary resettlement and no recruitment.
The fact-finding mission concluded that the overwhelming majority of settlers are displaced persons from various parts of Azerbaijan.
Most important, the fact-finding mission saw no evidence of direct involvement by the authorities of Armenia in the territories.
The result of the fact-finding mission should have put Azerbaijani concerns to rest and convinced Azerbaijan of the necessity of making a genuine effort to negotiate a lasting solution to the Nagorny Karabakh conflict, within the OSCE Minsk Group.
As a matter of fact, there was a common understanding between the parties concerned that, with the convening of the fact-finding mission, the matter would be put to rest.
It is with sadness that we note the futile effort of our negotiating partner to keep an agenda item alive by transferring its consideration to the sixtieth session, which is both pointless and counterproductive.
We express our strong dissatisfaction with the Azerbaijani decision.
We remind the General Assembly that Armenia is negotiating on behalf of Nagorny Karabakh within the OSCE Minsk group framework because Azerbaijan refuses to negotiate directly with the authorities of Nagorny Karabakh.
Any Azerbaijani exploitation of that fact within international organizations will therefore result in Armenia's disengagement from the negotiation process.
Armenia was opposed to the inclusion of item 163 in the agenda of the fifty-ninth session.
Armenia is opposed to the deferral of the consideration of the agenda item to the sixtieth session.
Hence, Armenia dissociates itself from the decision to defer consideration of agenda item 163, “The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan,” to the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.
The President (spoke in French): May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to defer consideration of this item and to include it in the draft agenda of its sixtieth session?
It was so decided.
The President (spoke in French): The Assembly has thus concluded its consideration of agenda item 163.
Agenda items remaining for consideration during the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly
The President (spoke in French): I should like to remind delegations that the following agenda items, on which action has been taken at previous meetings, have remained open for consideration during the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly: items 7, 10 to 12, 15 (c), 17, 17 (h), 17 (i), 19, 20, 27, 36, 37, 39, 75, 84, 106, 108, 109, 111 to 119, 121 to 123, 126, 127, 129 to 137, 146, 153 to 155 and 164.
As members are aware, those items — with the exception of sub-item (h) of agenda item 17, entitled “Appointment of members of the Joint Inspection Unit”; sub-item (i) of agenda item 17, entitled “Appointment of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services”; agenda item 111, entitled “Administrative and budgetary coordination of the United Nations with the specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency”; agenda item 117, entitled “United Nations pension system”; and agenda item 119, entitled “Review of the implementation of General Assembly resolutions 48/218 B and 54/244” — have been included in the provisional agenda of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.
May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of those items at the present session?
It was so decided.
