The Commission has already started to lay the foundations for this Balkan summit and we look forward to working closely with the French Presidency in order to make more detailed preparations.
I have recently had occasion to reflect on the increasingly important continuum of interaction between the European institutions.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, our legislative system has been working ever more efficiently under the new codecision procedure.
This procedure applies to a greatly increased range of legislation, yet there has been less need to resort to conciliation.
A recent survey shows that more than half the legislative proposals put forward over the past year were adopted in two readings and almost a fifth required only one reading.
This means that the legislative process is maturing and becoming more and more consensual.
I find this encouraging, given that the Commission has recommended to the IGC that the scope of the co-decision procedure, together with the qualified majority voting procedure, should be extended.
It will give even more democratic legitimacy to the European legislative process, and this is vital to the political health of the Union.
President Chirac, I welcome your commitment to the success of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations, that is to the necessary reform of our institutions.
Your commitment gives a clear, positive signal to our candidate country negotiating partners.
In Biarritz and in Nice, Europe will need all your skills and a great sense of responsibility on all sides.
We are all aware of how essential it is to reinforce our institutions and make them function more effectively.
This is the essential precondition for enlargement.
We will have various other opportunities to go into this question in greater detail.
Today, let me simply stress an obvious point, which is, moreover, the crux of what we want to achieve in Nice and beyond.
With 27-28 or more States, the Union will need stronger institutions, not weaker ones.
We will need a stronger, not weaker democratic commitment and a stronger, not more elusive legal system.
In this respect, it therefore an illusion to believe that the 'Monnet method' is a thing of the past, something that could be more effectively be replaced with ad hoc arrangements.
The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice are our institutions, and they provide the guarantees and the checks and balances without which nothing lasting can be built.
Because they are so essential we must work to improve them, and this is the task to which we are all committed for Nice.
The next six months are clearly going to be busy, and I am convinced that by the time France hands over the torch to Sweden, we will have made very considerable progress in building the Europe our citizens want and expect.
Madam President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats greatly appreciates the fact that you, President Chirac, have spoken here today, at the start of the French Presidency.
After all, we do not take it for granted that the President of the European Council will appear before us at the start of the Presidency.
We believe it speaks of your highly personal commitment to the unification of Europe.
We are also grateful for the fact that the French constitution provides for the President of the Republic of France to be responsible for European policy and we know that with you, it is in good hands.
We have faith in you.
We wish you every success for the Presidency.
We wish you success on a personal level and we know that if you are successful, then this will be to everyone' s gain and European unification will benefit.
You have made eloquent speeches before the German Bundestag and before this House, thereby opening the debate on Europe' s future.
The debates on Europe' s future, as well as those on the Intergovernmental Conference, go together.
We must ask ourselves what kind of Europe we want and how we want to achieve it.
I am grateful to you for bringing Pierre Pflimlin and Robert Schuman to mind.
We are proud that both men were Christian Democrats.
Last Friday, we paid our last respects to Pierre Pflimlin in the cathedral here in Strasbourg.
Mr Poncelet, the Chairman of the Senate, read out a message on your behalf.
All those present, including our President and others, were deeply moved.
The European flag stood next to Pierre Pflimlin' s coffin, and at the end of the service, which was not a mournful service but one of hope and confidence, the European anthem was played and sung by a choir.
If this had been possible 100 years ago - as early as 1900 - what suffering and misery our European continent would have been spared!
That is why European unification policy is, in essence, a policy of peace.
We Members of the European People' s Party and European Democrats want to use our large majority - naturally some would beg to differ - to achieve a fully integrated Europe.
We want strong European institutions and a strong European Parliament that stands shoulder to shoulder with the Council of Ministers in all matters of European legislation.
We want to achieve this under your Presidency and with your support, Mr President.
You were a Member of the European Parliament yourself after the first European elections.
We remember this well, we were colleagues at the time, if I might be so bold.
We then went our separate ways, but we still regard you as a former Member of the European Parliament, as an ally, and would therefore hope to have the same rights as the Council of Ministers in all matters of legislation.
(Applause)
Furthermore, we want a strong Commission.
The Commission has certainly proved itself as the Guardian of the Treaties over the last few months, and I am very grateful to you for this Mr Prodi, in your capacity as President of the Commission.
We also want the European Commission to be the European executive.
I am grateful that we are completely in step with the Commission - also with the outstanding French Member who has responsibility for such issues, namely Michel Barnier - on this institutional issue.
Mr President of the European Council, I was pleased to hear you say that the days when decisions were taken behind closed doors are over, and that these decisions must be transparent.
I have the feeling that there is one European institution whose decisions could be a fraction more transparent, and that is the Council of Ministers, and I would suggest that we should also give thought some time to improving transparency here.
(Applause)
Then there is the European Court of Justice.
We need to strengthen it so that it has a voice, because the European Union' s greatest achievement is that these days, we deal with the inevitable conflicts and differences of interests by means of the law.
The European Union is a Community of law and that is our greatest asset.
Indeed that is why we must equip the European Court of Justice with the necessary tools.
In your Berlin speech, you spoke of the great project of a constitution.
The vast majority of our group responded warmly to this.
We will have to answer the following questions: what do our nation states do?, what do our regions do?, what do the local regional administrative bodies do?
All this within the context of subsidiarity, as you said.
But it is vital for us to have a single institutional framework within the European Union, and to avoid the development of parallel structures.
Not only would the citizens fail to understand it if there were, there would be no real legal basis either.
Which is why we are far from receptive to the idea of creating a succession of new secretariats, for this is something the European Union must do, through its strong institutions and on the basis of European law.
(Applause)
Mr President, the most important thing of course, is for majority voting in the Council of Ministers to become the fundamental method of decision making.
It is not enough just to extend majority voting.
Majority voting must become the fundamental method of decision making in the Council of Ministers.
As far as the Commission is concerned - and this is directed at our highly esteemed colleague Mr Jacques Santer - Luxembourg will never be without a Member in the Commission and if each Member State is to be represented in the Commission, then I would imagine that the smaller countries too would consent to a new weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers.
I also have an observation to make about the tasks performed by the national parliaments and the European Parliament.
The European Parliament is responsible, together with the Council of Ministers, for legislation, and I have no time at all for the idea put forward by the German Foreign Minister - who has otherwise put forward some sound proposals - that only national delegates should belong to the European Parliament.
That is an antiquated way of looking at things and we will oppose any ideas of that ilk in no uncertain terms!
(Applause) It is the task of the national parliaments to make a better job of supervising the activities of their own governments as Members of the Council of Ministers, and I believe the European Parliament and national parliaments should join forces to this end.
We have great confidence in the French Presidency, President Chirac, and the same goes for you personally.
We congratulate you on winning the Euro 2000 football tournament.
It bodes well for your presidency.
I hope Europe proves to be as successful as the French national team at Euro 2000!
I wish you every success.
If you are successful then it will be to the advantage of us all.
(Applause)
Madam President, President of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen of the House, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to welcome in the French Presidency.
By a fortunate coincidence, at this crucial point in our history one of the founding countries, the homeland of Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman and Pierre Pflimlin, is presiding over the fate of the European Union.
So let me at this early stage express my best wishes for the success of the French Presidency, the President and Government of France, and let me also say that there is not just a desire for success, there is a need for success, a great success.
The President presented four major working areas for the next six-month period.
In the first place, we share the French Presidency' s opinion that institutional reform is a basic prerequisite for the further development of the European Union, especially for these fine plans for enlargement and the commitment we have undertaken.
What we need is, if I might use the English phrase, a 'nice treaty in Nice' , and I am counting on you.
This, however, is precisely why we need to be able to include the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty,
(Loud applause) because we must effectively establish our community of values and, in this respect, I should like to pay tribute to the French Presidency' s determination because it must not be forgotten that you have defended these principles in your own country and in Europe, and we consider that if we wish to solve the problems we face at the moment looking to the future - and I am thinking of the case of Austria - it is essential that we are able to include both this affirmation of a community of values as well as methods of defending these principles in the Treaty.
There is another aspect of the French President' s speech which is important.
He criticised decision making behind closed doors.
It would be a good thing if this were applied to the Intergovernmental Conference.
I was pleased to see the French President, in his Bundestag address, defending the method of the Convention, whereby the Members of the European Parliament, the members of the national parliaments, representatives of the governments and the Commission work together.
Why should we not extend this method of constitutional reform which you so ardently desire, in order to build upon what we have already, and not to build castles in the air?
Well, because, if a constitution has to be drawn up, it should be drawn up on the basis of the three-way division of power between the institutions.
The Commission and the parliaments and the Council and the Court of Justice must all be strengthened.
(Applause)
There is one fundamental question - in Santa Maria da Feira there was discussion of closer cooperation - but such closer cooperation is extremely closely related to the rule of majority decision making in Council and to codecision involving Parliament.
It is all part of the same package, and it is something that requires serious work.
In the second place, you also mentioned safeguarding the European social model, reiterating the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit - which we feel are a move in the right direction, the direction of defending the trio of 'employment, social cohesion and competitivity' .
I shall take the liberty, Mr President, of adding two further fundamental questions to this agenda.
One of these is the future of public services, of universal European services,
(Applause)
and the other is the bearing they have on economic and social cohesion, in order to prevent an increase in the economic and social divide which may already exist.
We think this must be included in the package.
We welcome the Commission' s initiative, at the instigation of Mrs Diamantopoulou, and we hope that we shall be able to make progress here, in a manner that is most directly linked with strengthening our economic and monetary power too.
Now we are in the happy situation of having twelve members within the euro zone, and soon we are set to make it fifteen, but we nonetheless have to defend and consolidate the euro.
This is an absolute priority!
The third point, a Europe that is closer to the citizens.
In this area, regarding the environment, consumer protection and food safety, we are absolutely in agreement.
A Europe closer to the citizens is precisely what we were asking of the Commission before voting on its appointment.
We consider this an excellent arena for action to bring Europe closer to the citizens.
There is also one sensitive subject in this area, and that is sport, which you gave as one of your priorities.
I shall not confine myself to congratulating you, I should also like to say that the composition of the French national team is decidedly a pioneering way of seeing the multiracial and multicultural Europe of tomorrow,
(Loud applause)
and we believe that we must strive to eradicate this obscure capitalism which mars sport and to promote sport and the advancement of European youth.
In conclusion, Madam President, let me turn to foreign policy.
I would urge the Presidency not to make extravagant gestures so that we do not end up paying for commitments which do not match up to our ambitions.
If we want to be involved in foreign policy, then we must do so in a responsible manner, keeping our promises, in such a way as to circumvent a conflict between Parliament and the Council, which would be liable to obstruct development in this area which is so vital for Europe.
(Loud Applause)
Madam President, I want, on behalf of my group, to express a very warm welcome to Mr Chirac both in his role as President-in-Office of the Council and for coming here as President of France to underline the importance which France and he personally attach to the work of this presidency.
Last Sunday, thanks to "the blues" , France became Champions of Europe.
I hope that, under your Presidency, France will once again become a champion for Europe!
We have listened with great interest to your speech today and to the speech you made last week in Berlin.
Both make important contributions to the European debate.
The Europe of tomorrow matters to all of us.
Much in the European debate is unsettled.
What is the territory of Europe; what are its function, identity and values?
In launching such a debate you have done Europe a service.
However, the incentive to speculate on tomorrow's Europe should not become a disincentive to act on today's Europe.
As we contemplate enlargement, today's Europe of fifteen has, as you have remarked this morning, major tasks in hand.
One cannot underestimate the importance of the "Amsterdam leftovers" as we prepare ourselves for this enlargement.
You have spoken of having more than an accord à minimum.
We certainly agree with that.
My group attaches very great importance, as you have done today, to a charter of fundamental rights as part of the package that we contemplate in Nice.
Like you, Mr President, we believe that Europe should be based on the values of freedom, dignity, tolerance, democracy and rights.
We respect the role of the European Commission in bringing balance to our debate and our respective interests.
We value the access which our citizens have to democratic checks and balances - through this House and elsewhere - in the formulation of European legislation.
We value transparency and working in public on the record, not behind closed doors.
We value the rights of citizens to appeal to the European Court of Justice where they perceive injustice.
None of these things are characteristic of intergovernmentalism.
We must be cautious about a drift in that direction.
My group believes that a strong Europe needs European institutions with a key role for the European Commission.
I agree with you that we should have a constitution for Europe.
We can launch a debate on that but clearly it is too complex a question to resolve in the next six months.
I would express one hope: that this debate does not become a third lock on the door of enlargement.
Helsinki set two tests: firstly we must reform ourselves in Nice; secondly the candidate states must take on board the acquis communautaire.
We should not add a third lock on the door by saying we must have a constitution before they join.
It is our historic task to bring about a successful enlargement.
I know from your remarks that you agree with that.
It is important to give that reassurance.
I believe that France, once again, has the opportunity to champion the cause of Europe.
We wish you and your government every success in the next six months.
Madam President, Mr President, your country has taken the leadership in European football and is now required to take leadership of the European Union at a key moment in its history.
I know full well that a presidency must assure continuity in the running of the institutions, but there are times when necessary changes in direction have to be made.
I think we shall be facing such times in the next six months.
Your Berlin speech where you argued in favour of implementing a process to develop a European constitution is, like several of the suggestions you have made today, a positive sign for the future.
I should like, for my part, to raise three issues on which your presidency ought to be focussing, in my opinion.
I shall begin with something that is of prime importance to all of us: the institutional reform which is the necessary precondition to enlargement.
This reform must be ambitious.
It cannot be confined to technical amendments just to keep the European machine ticking over.
To put it plainly, the three points left over from Amsterdam in no way represent an adequate agenda.
Nor is the response of emphasising the mechanism of closer cooperation a satisfactory one, not - let me explain this - if one is really concerned to make up the significant democratic deficit which typifies the way the European Union operates at the moment.
Intensified cooperation has one great merit, it makes it possible to avoid deadlock, but it is also a significant risk factor if careful attention is not paid, taking the European Parliament and the Commission out of the loop, and bringing the intergovernmental solution back with a vengeance, a solution which has for many years been identified as inadequate and, indeed, far from democratic.
Moreover, the ambitious and necessary plans for a European constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights, one of which is being postponed indefinitely, the other being assigned a non-binding status, should not be used to conceal the paucity of the rights acquired in the coming months.
You declared, Mr President, that we must reassert the values uniting us and defend the spirit of the founders of the European Union, whose goals were peace and stability in Europe.
We have, admittedly, achieved peace and stability within the European Union, but let us not close our eyes to the facts.
The globalisation of issues has gained the upper hand in the course of recent years.
The imbalance between north and south has grown worse, as all the international reports confirm.
Poverty in the world is not on the decline, quite the opposite.
Sources of fresh conflict are making themselves felt throughout the world, as well as ecological chaos, particularly climate change, whose worst effects are felt in precisely those areas where the populations are most disadvantaged.
In the face of uncontrollable events, the implications for the future are disconcerting, and the Hague Summit should represent a change in this respect.
The European Union must take the offensive.
I heard you say that you were in favour of this, under France' s leadership.
This is where we run up against contradictions, however.
I believe that it is not possible to wish for peace and sustainable development while actively endorsing the rationale of economic and commercial warfare worldwide, and that includes favouring the arms trade over conflict prevention.
Our pattern of development is in question.
We have to rethink our economic choices, in the knowledge that right now, instead of distributing current wealth, the industrialised countries are in fact stealing from the wealth of the future.
In connection with this, and, in my view, this is the third crucial issue for the next few months, which I would like to outline briefly, we must fundamentally reconsider the so far harmful role of the World Trade Organisation, which acts more like a world trading organisation.
Your country, Mr President, is one of the most critical European countries in this respect.
It is also in France that the people are most hostile to the dictatorship of free trade.
We await from you practical proposals for the WTO to be restored to its original role, that of a regulatory body for world trade, in a worldwide context dominated by the primacy of human and social rights, health and the quality of the environment.
By achieving this, the European Union would gain credit not only within the European Union but also throughout the world.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President, the French Presidency of the European Union is starting at a time when the debate on the meaning and future of the construction of Europe is continually increasing in scale.
I do not think that I am exaggerating when I speak of a crisis of confidence that exists between many European citizens and the European institutions, or at the very least a malaise and a search for a new European identity.
Although we are attracted by the European ideal, we are puzzled or repelled by the reality of Europe.
It is a real problem.
In this respect, the slogans coming out of the mass rallies such as those held in Seattle, Washington, Geneva and Millau: "the world is not for sale" , "politicians are powerless in the face of globalisation" , "let the people decide" are the overt expression of much more widespread concerns and expectations which are of direct concern to the Europe that we are building.
In order to have a hope of starting to meet these expectations, the French Presidency should, in the opinion of my Group, endeavour to issue positive messages in three directions, which are, incidentally, closely related.
In the first place, it should express the determination to urge Europe to free itself from the neoliberal model that shapes globalisation at the present time.
In the second place, it should prove its determination to favour the restoration of political will, political choice and political responsibility in the face of the power of the markets, the mega-companies and their lobbies.
Thirdly, it should encourage the real involvement of the social operators in our various countries as well as the nascent movements of European citizens in the process of framing European policy.
Are the objectives of the French Presidency which you have just outlined, Mr President, such as to afford such prospects?
A plain 'no' would be rather perfunctory and, to tell the truth, rather depressing, but I would not be sincere in responding with a categorical 'yes' either, even if a not a non-committal Normandy man.
So, while institutional reform is certainly essential, the key issue of the involvement of the citizens in the worksite on which Europe is being built has not, however, been included on the agenda for the intergovernmental conference.
The social agenda is a magnificent challenge which we certainly intend to help to take up.
In connection with this, you made statements which we might endorse regarding employment as the central objective of European Union policy, the fight against exclusion in all its forms, lifelong training, and the involvement of employees in company decisions.
All that remains now is to establish objectives with definite figures and deadlines that can be checked, to set aside adequate funding, and to stipulate what rights employees have to be involved in the management of companies.
We also need, Mr President, to specify what is meant by the proposed work for all and the social protection appropriate to the requirements of our time.
You emphasise that it is our political will that will support the European social model and, indeed, political will is going to prove necessary in order to put a stop to the subordination of social policy to the rationale of the stability pact and the present endeavours of the European Central Bank.
Political will is going to prove necessary in order to reach an agreement among fifteen Member States against social or fiscal dumping or in order to curb the unbridled trend to liberalise public services.
Political will is going to prove necessary in order to consider limiting the discretionary power of the Commission in matters of competition policy.
Action must be taken at each of these levels, in my opinion, and many others too, in order to promote a model of development in solidarity and a social Europe.
Quite rightly, you stressed the Europe of men and women.
We agree with the idea of promoting trade, the planned European food safety agency, increasing the safety of maritime transport, highlighting the fight to protect our environment, with the reaffirmed determination to rid sport of commercial criteria and, finally, with including economic and social rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We would like to see this Charter used as a basis for the settlement of future disputes and as an acknowledged reference for a community of values for the entire continent.
On the other hand, we are unable to agree - but that will come as no surprise - with anything that contributes to the prospect of fortress Europe.
Although we want Europe to be closed to traffickers, we want it to remain open to individuals.
Similarly, we are unable to approve of the European Union' s accelerated militarisation, which tends to overshadow real foreign policy initiatives.
We consider, with the success of enlargement, the expression of a strong alternative opinion to that of the American superpower on the international scene and within crucial institutions to be the major challenge to civilisation facing Europeans at the present time.
In this context, we welcome the prospect of the Euro-Mediterranean Summit, and hope that it will form part of an approach of this kind.
More generally, the reports issued, one after another, by international organisations on the state of the world are sounding the alarm: the unacceptable tragedy of AIDS in Africa, the disastrous review of the results in Geneva of the application of the commitments made five years ago in Copenhagen in order to reduce poverty, the continued stranglehold of debt and, at one and the same time, the boom in the financial world which is quite removed from the real economy and people' s real lives.
In all these areas, people are waiting for Europe to take action and, to conclude, it is on this last point that I would like, if you would permit me, to address you directly, Mr President.
There is one step which, if you were to take it, would most certainly provide one of the positive messages I mentioned at the start of my speech, and which would have an effect in all three of the directions in which we expect the presidency to act.
I am referring to a Tobin type measure or something similar, to tax the speculative movement of capital.
There are times, as you said before the Bundestag, when you have to be able to take the risk and go off the beaten track.
This is the price that has to be paid if we are to engage in the great adventure of the European Community.
Madam President, Mr President, as our English chums say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
Well, this is the recipe for this improbable European Union of ours, which every day intrudes further into the daily life of the peoples of Europe.
For six months, then, we shall have French leadership.
In any other area, this would be a guarantee of the best quality, as we have just seen.
Unfortunately, there will be two parties that appear to have problems in agreeing on the menu to be served in Nice.
Thank heavens, the local gastronomic style, which I know very well, will get us out of the predicament.
A simple way of cooking provides the best results with the fewest ingredients.
On a more serious note, ladies and gentlemen, the Intergovernmental Conference is akin to the squaring of the circle for one quite simple reason, but one that everyone conspires to conceal.
It is not a matter of settling a few minor details but of selecting a new decision-making process within a set of institutions that governs 80% of the lives of Europeans and which, whether we like it or not, as already quasi-federal in nature.
The issue at stake for each of our countries, especially the least populated ones, is whether they retain or lose their involvement at Community level, whether they give up or retain their right to say 'no' , and whether or not they agree to be subject to an outside jurisdiction.
The Brussels Commission, from the very outset, and the Council of Ministers, since the Treaty of Amsterdam withdrew this initiative are federal institutions, as Parliament is, and as indeed are the European Central Bank and the Court of Justice.
So if the proposals outlined by the French Presidency, particularly making qualified majority voting the general rule, are confirmed in Nice, then we should once and for all have enabled this federal Europe to operate in isolation, protected from all the national democracies that simply gather for the quarterly photograph of the European Council.
Having appropriated monetary and judicial authority, they now wish to take all executive and legislative power away from the nation states.
These problems may explain the fact that, abandoning the sterility of the compulsory ritual stipulated by the IGC, some leaders, following the example set by the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, have given in to the urge to go in for a freestyle approach, with the advantages and disadvantages this entails, the latter far outweighing the former, in my opinion.
For the European Union is like a party where everyone brings along the food they wish to eat: Britain sees it as a market, France as a policy, Italy as a credo, Germany as a hope and a future.
Each of our countries projects its own recipe for greatness onto Europe, even though this view is not shared by its neighbour.
It is already hard enough to set up a single currency on this basis, so how on earth is a constitution going to be achieved?
Sovereign states forge agreements by means of treaties, not within a single constitution.
The only known exception to this rule was the ephemeral Confederation of Independent States, which we inevitably think of when the concept of a federation of nation states comes up.
A constitution is not a list, or a catalogue or an index.
A constitution is a basis for a new legal order.
It is the supreme law in this order, and takes precedence over all others.
Adopting a European constitution would ipso facto render all the national constitutions null and void, reduced to the level of a mere Member State by-law.
(Mixed reactions)
The truth, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the European Union, is that this Europe is and shall continue to be forced to forge ahead regardless as long as it persists in thinking of itself as essentially superior to the nations which form it and, hence, destined to replace them sooner or later.
What is in question is not so much the presumption of such a plan, as its obsolescence.
Every day your Europe is being eclipsed more and more in the face of the globalisation achieved by finance, whose centre of gravity is in the United States, and now it is through Europe, through the Commission, through the European Parliament that the most dubious regulations of this globalisation are being foisted on our fellow citizens.
This is where chocolate is abolished but GMOs are legalised.
This is where ...
(The President cut the speaker off since speaking time had expired)
Mr President, there was a time, when you yourself, Mr Chirac, took sides against the foreigner.
What a contrast there is between your Cochin address and your speech to the Reichstag, in which you gave a foreign parliament the first taste of your federalist thinking, supporting the idea of a European constitution!
Have you changed or have times changed to this extent?
Does one have to be modern to have the support of a few well-meaning broadsheets?
Or indeed, as in the case of the Treaty of Amsterdam, is the need of the moment all the explanation necessary?
Was it really necessary - although not very Gaullist even in 1974 - to become a centrist under Mr Mitterrand, even though the support you gained on the left was more than offset by the support you lost on the right?
You recommended saying 'yes' to Maastricht because the 1995 presidential elections were drawing close.
It would have been a simple matter to dismiss the single currency, the so-called single currency, and put it off forever but you preferred to reduce France to the mediocre level of a general council, rather than the rank of a statesman.
Because Mr Mitterrand had had his Treaty, you wanted one of your own, in Amsterdam.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam proved insufficient, you are looking for another, this time in Nice.
Basically, you are acting like a political schemer of the Third Republic, constantly underestimating France' s potential and overestimating that of your rivals.
You have not noticed that in the nuclear age, the electric age, strength no longer lies in numbers, and that, in order to maintain its leading position, France must continue along the path initiated by General de Gaulle.
(Mixed reactions in the Chamber) Defending France' s interests alone in all areas - but you are, of course, all anti-Gaullist over there, that goes without saying - in all areas and always, being restricted as little as possible by international commitments, such as Europe, NATO, the UN, G7 -8 -9, not waging war on behalf of others, not ratifying the treaties before the others do.
How can you possibly claim that this supranational Europe strengthens France' s hand, when France holds only 11% of the votes within European bodies, a percentage which does not even match its economic power and still less its position in the field of leading edge technology?
By instigating a simplification of the closer cooperation procedures, you have offered our European partners a two- rather than a three-way directorate.
I hope that those who are excluded from this will be opposed to the attempt which, in fact, is playing into the hands of the Germans.
Is that not right, Mr Cohn-Bendit?
Belittling France by allowing important decisions to be taken without France' s agreement, when, through this closer cooperation, European treaties may, if necessary, be amended to the detriment of France...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, Mr President, France is assuming the presidency of the European Union for the next six months.
While it would seem necessary and legitimate to seek to reform the institutions and to give them a new lease of life, given that the system is so flawed and lacking in democracy, we should nonetheless not forget the main thing, which is the welfare, respect and full development of the peoples which make up the nations of Europe.
I am a member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities.
This name in itself represents our programme, whose prime objective is to ensure that the identities and aspirations of each country are taken into optimum consideration, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
Following the crisis of the Santer Commission - which rocked the institutions - why the devil did they bury the expert committee' s report exposing the serious mismanagement within the institutions?
We must learn the lessons of the past in order to make preparations for the future to avoid, once again, strengthening the powers of the Commission, a technocratic structure operating without transparency or democracy.
Should we not challenge the political dimension it has granted itself?
We cannot be content with a Europe adopting ever more dehumanised texts that are too far removed from the needs of the people, who are often the victims of such texts in their daily lives, especially when the vague nature of such texts often means that the final decision is made by the Court of Justice which, by dint of its power of interpretation, sets itself up as a true legislative authority, but without any political supervision.
We reject government by officials as much as we reject government by judges.
Consequently, the IGC must not be the instrument of a reform which will turn the Europe of tomorrow into a technocratic monster, ever more ignorant of the peoples' legitimate concerns and of the opinion of the national parliaments that represent them.
We cannot agree to this reform granting some states the right and the power to force binding texts on states which are unwilling.
The institutional reform we are promised is putting a stranglehold on our nations, especially the smallest ones.
New administrative and voting systems are being created which give power and hegemony to those that some people call pioneer states.
This is not acceptable.
Diversity must be respected, and we must allow diversities to be expressed, for they are the true wealth of Europe.
Whereas the construction of Europe ought to be seeking to achieve coordination between the policies of Member States, the objective of integration is leading us towards an intolerable process of uniformisation.
This accelerated uniformisation, the origin of the single model, runs counter to the very thing that we strive to safeguard every day, namely diversity.
How is it possible to claim to defend the individual' s aspiration for a better life when every day challenging our cultures and our traditions a little more?
The fact is, behind the institutional debates, there are a number of particularly important subjects, such as employment, health, food safety and the protection of local products.
In addition, there is the entire debate on balanced regional development and respect for the users of territories, and also the future of public services and state monopolies.
We maintain that the French-style public service, which is of particular structural value in terms of regional planning and social cohesion, such as postal, railway and energy services, etc., must be defended against the Commission' s position.
Does defending the national interest make one anti-European?
Does asking for the directives such as those on 'birds' , 'habitats' , 'open air markets' or 'biotechnologies' to be amended make one anti-European?
On the eve of enlargement, we need to carefully consider this acquis communautaire that some parties would like to make 'immutable' in principle, with scant regard for democracy and subsidiarity.
In conclusion, Mr President, we hope that you will have the determination to restore the right of expression to the elected representatives and the various peoples of Europe in order to prevent a new rural and territorial divide.
In order for France to speak with a single voice, it is the voice of the people which must be heard.
The 'blues' showed us the way.
It was a fine victory, Mr President, but the championship was possible only thanks to the Europe of the nations!
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, I have listened with great interest to the speeches by the representatives of the various groups and I am pleased to have this opportunity to express a few thoughts on these.
I should like, first of all, to thank the President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, who summed up the situation at the beginning of the French Presidency with great clarity.
I am pleased to learn of the intentions which he announced on behalf of the Commission, which are generally in line with those of the French Presidency.
We already had an opportunity to note as much yesterday as, according to the tradition, there was a working meeting between the government, all the Commissioners, the Commission President, the Prime Minister and myself.
This enabled us to observe the synergy between our concerns and ambitions.
Mr Prodi mentioned codecision in particular, and expressed his pleasure at the fact that this procedure was being gradually improved and was becoming more common.
He looked to the IGC to extend the use of codecision.
This is, as you know, one of the objectives of our presidency, along with the extension of qualified majority voting.
Chairman Poettering made a brilliant and generous speech, for which I must thank him particularly.
I appreciated it greatly.
He mentioned a number of subjects.
Mr Chairman, the presidency can already answer your question regarding greater transparency on the part of the Council.
It has been announced specifically that the French Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for European Affairs will come to the European Parliament after every 'General Affairs' Council to inform Parliament and to ensure the necessary dialogue with Parliament.
This is one step in the direction you suggested, and I hope that it will serve to improve relations between our two great institutions and also, of course, to clarify the development of the subjects under discussion.
We also share your concern to have strong institutions, as you emphasised.
I said as much yesterday in Paris, at the meeting with the Commission.
I said this to Mr Prodi.
This is a prerequisite if our work is to be effective and if the European Union' s role on the international stage is to be asserted properly.
Let me add, to respond to a concern you expressed, that I endorse completely the idea you put forward to the effect that we need a single institutional framework and, above all, no parallel frameworks.
That goes without saying.
Everything that can give new impetus to the construction of Europe must be achieved both within the institutions and in accordance with the acquis communautaire.
This is perfectly plain as far as the French Presidency is concerned.
I have taken note of the wish to see that the Court of Justice is given the necessary resources.
Chairman Barón Crespo, who appears to be as familiar with the subtleties of the English language as he is with the French, mentioned a number of subjects which lie at the heart of the presidency' s thinking.
Regarding the European social model, one of the main objectives of the French Presidency is to arrive at an agreement on the social agenda in Nice.
We shall do everything in our power to achieve this objective.
Regarding public services, a subject mentioned by a number of speakers, the last of whom was Mr Saint-Josse, I should like to say that the French Presidency is very attentive to this matter.
We are well aware of the need to modernise and adapt public services, but we also know that they are a key element in the equal rights and opportunities of all citizens within a country and that this equality cannot, of course, be subject only or mainly to the criteria of profitability, which would inevitably lead to people in unprofitable situations being deprived of services provided in other circumstances to people in cities, for example, in more favourable economic conditions.
(Applause)
Quite obviously, this is not France' s ambition.
For a long time I have represented an extremely poor, rural constituency in France, and I can tell you that I consider, and have always considered, that it had just the same entitlement - and indeed the same duties to contribute in the form of taxation - with regard to the main public services, the lifeblood of the nation, as any district in Paris.
We shall therefore take great care to ensure that the necessary modernisation of public services is not confused with making them profitable, which would be a serious mistake.
(Applause)
Mr Barón Crespo mentioned many other things, particularly closer cooperation, development of the social model and enlargement.
He also mentioned the charter of rights.
This is something to which we also attach great importance.
We should like to see the convention, in which Parliament is to a great extent involved, issue its conclusions very quickly, before Biarritz, if possible, so that we can discuss them there.
That also means that the charter must include all the values, all the principles and rights on which our convictions and our societies are based, i.e. not only civil and political rights but also economic and social rights.
(Applause)
France is extremely keen to see economic and social rights clearly expressed in this charter.
Indeed, this is the main demand from the European Trade Union Confederation, one I find legitimate and justifiable.
If we wish to have a European social model, then it must be based on clear principles, which must be clearly defined, and they would best be expressed in the charter.
The problem, which a number of speakers mentioned, of integrating the charter into the treaty is one which has yet to be discussed.
The convention' s conclusions have not yet been published.
We should await their conclusions on this subject.
At the present stage, the opinions of the various operators involved are still, I would say, rather contradictory and have not, in any case, been firmly expressed.
We need time before we give our opinion on this.
I am not absolutely sure that a clear decision can be taken in Nice.
If it is possible, so much the better.
At any event, France' s ambition is to see the advent of the charter in Nice, a charter with the scope and ambition to which I referred just now.
Chairman Cox, like Mr Poettering, pointed out the importance he attached to strong institutions.
My response is similar.
I think it essential to have strong institutions, i.e. which have the necessary power to accept their responsibilities, but also the power to avoid deadlock.
It is clear right now that we are in a situation where the prospect of enlargement may lead to deadlock if we do not take the action required to enable Europe to overcome the sluggishness which is going to increase with enlargement.
This, indeed, is the reason why we attach so much importance, firstly, to the problem of the weighting of votes and, secondly, to the problem of closer cooperation.
Closer cooperation is in no way intended to create a Europe divided between those in the vanguard and those lagging behind, but simply to give the necessary impetus to the proper operation of Europe and thus to enable those that wish to go slightly faster in certain areas to do so, which will necessarily result in others being carried along in its wake.
This is an extremely important and almost institutional factor in pulling people along.
Mr Cox, you need have no fear on the subject of enlargement, which other speakers also mentioned, and which President Prodi discussed in a particularly firm manner.
If we want to make absolutely certain of the success of institutional reform, i.e. the IGC and the related Treaty of Nice, it is because we want enlargement to go ahead as speedily as possible.
Enlargement as quickly as possible is not, of course, synonymous with political decision.
Enlargement is not a political decision.
It is a shared political determination to be capable of applying the same rules throughout the Europe of tomorrow.
Of course, it presupposes a determination to enlarge on the part of the European Union: this is clear and not seriously challenged by anyone.
It also, however, presupposes a determination on the part of the candidate countries to undertake the reforms necessary to be able to join the European Union, without which the Union would be disrupted and the states joining without having undertaken the necessary reforms in order to adapt to the Community standards would face major social, economic and political difficulties.
In this spirit, we are absolutely determined, Mr President, to ensure that the negotiations undertaken with each candidate country are continued and intensified.
We shall carry out our work in this field as quickly and as well as possible, with a view, I would stress, as President Prodi said just now, to enlarging as quickly as possible.
There is no doubt about it.
The point of constructing Europe in the first place was to establish peace, and to cause it to take root, after so many pointless fratricidal wars; establishing peace and, consequently, democracy, since they go together.
Peace and democracy cannot be established within just one part of Europe, they must be established throughout the whole of Europe.
We can discuss Europe' s frontiers afterwards - that is another matter - but peace and democracy must apply to the whole of Europe.
Enlargement, then, is not just a moral requirement of candidate countries, but is also in the fundamental interest of a Europe that one wishes to see existing tomorrow, based on the principles of peace, democracy, human rights and freedoms.
(Applause)
Mr Lannoye specifically mentioned the problem of closer cooperation.
I have just answered this.
He also mentioned the state of the world today in terms which, I must admit, moved me and which I endorse.
It is true that we live in a world where the gap between rich and poor is increasing.
The UNDP report for 1999, by which I mean not the report tabled this year but last year, gave an example which, although not significant, is still striking, saying that the three largest private fortunes in the world today are equivalent to the sum of the gross national products of all the least developed countries, representing 600 million people.
What is more, it can be observed that this phenomenon is on the increase, and so is the resulting exclusion, and this is one of the main dangers of today' s world.
Major debates are underway on the subject of globalisation, as Mr Lannoye pointed out.
I am not, of course, going to enter into such a debate right now, even though Europe cannot remain apart from these debates, and so the Presidency, like the Commission and Parliament, must necessarily get involved.
Globalisation is clearly inescapable and inevitable and is, for the most part, the result of the development of techniques and technology.
It also provides some advantages because it does facilitate trade and, nowadays, trade is the greatest creator of wealth.
It does, therefore, have positive aspects, which it would be foolish to deny.
It also has dangers, however, in three areas in particular.
Firstly, the danger we have just mentioned: the exclusion of those who cannot go as fast as the others.
This is true in terms of the citizens within a single country and today we can observe an increase in exclusion despite strong growth and declining unemployment.
It is also true in terms of nations, where we can see rich counties getting even richer and poor countries, alas, becoming even poorer, as Mr Lannoye said just now.
(Applause)
This is a shift in world society to which we must be very attentive and which we cannot, of course, accept.
The subject is to be discussed, moreover, in the near future in G7 and G8, but it is a subject of concern to everyone, especially Europe.
The second risk of globalisation which has also been mentioned is the serious threat to the world' s ecosystem.
As soon as one seeks to maximise profits, which is understandable to a certain extent because profits are a factor in progress, but as soon as one seeks to maximise profits without real restrictions that are internationally acknowledged and imposed in order to prevent excesses, then there comes a time when the damage inflicted on nature is such that it is no longer able to regenerate.
It is not obvious, but it is a real problem, which must be taken seriously.
(Applause)
The typical example mentioned by a number of speakers was the Hague Conference to be held in autumn on greenhouse gas emissions.
If, as seems likely and even highly likely, scientists' conclusions indicate that these emissions present serious risks to the ecological balance of our planet, thus seriously compromising the legacy we are leaving to future generations, then there are grounds for carefully researching ways to control these emissions.
For, as things stand at present, it is true to say that globalisation is going in exactly the opposite direction to this.
The final disadvantage, the final risk of globalisation, involves everything related to large-scale crime.
With the development of globalisation and advanced technology, with the Net, we can clearly see a trend for the considerable development of cybercrime in all areas: drugs, terrorism, crime of every kind.
Therefore, globalisation does entail risks, but what exactly does that mean?
It means that we cannot challenge globalisation as such, because it is going to spread, whatever we do.
We have to make the best of it, and this can be done by controlling it and giving it a human face, which means that we must be aware of the risks it involves.
This is the clear message that all major institutions, particularly the European Union and its institutions, must send out throughout the world.
(Applause)
This answer is also addressed to Mr Wurtz who also mentioned these problems, along with others, of course, particularly with regard to the Europe of the citizens.
I of course share his feeling that Europe must be first and foremost a Europe of the citizens.
We must respond to the concerns of everyday life.
We do not do this enough, that is true, even though, in my opinion, a great deal of progress has been made in this area.
The social debates which have been underway for three or four years now within the European Union could not have taken place seven or eight or ten years ago, when they would not even have been considered.
So, there has been some progress.
I have expressed my views on globalisation.
I do not believe, Mr President, that Fortress Europe is any sort of ambition or, indeed, any sort of reality.
Europe is open, by definition.
Europe' s commitment is to supporting a range of values, a culture and an identity which represents, I would say, the synthesis of the cultures and identities of each of the nations in Europe, hence the importance of maintaining cultural diversity and defending each European nation' s right to retain its own culture, identity and language.
On this basis, union, according to the old adage of strength through unity, is the only way to safeguard these cultures and identities in future when confronted with the multipolar world which is developing today and which is universally in evidence.
Tomorrow, we will be faced with a vast China, a vast India, a large South-East Asia and an organised South America, not to mention North America.
It is quite clear that if we are content to remain where we are now, divided to a greater or lesser extent, then we shall purely and simply vanish.
It is only by being united and, at the same time, retaining our own identities that we will be able to survive and, in this context, we must not be a fortress but we must, nevertheless, combine our forces and our efforts.
Finally, Mr Wurtz mentioned the notorious Tobin tax.
I should just like to tell him that the reform of the international monetary system is on the agenda, as he well knows, and that, clearly, we must combat the instability of the financial markets.
That is obvious, and I am, of course, committed to this.
It is one of the subjects we shall also be discussing at the G7 meeting in Okinawa.
In this spirit, I am willing to admit that we shall have to look closely into all the possible means of achieving this twofold objective of stability and equity, adopting an open-minded and realistic approach.
For a long time now I been taking not of Charles Pasqua' s comments on gastronomy, and indeed on other matters, and so I was very interested to hear him speak, there is no question of that, even if I did not completely recognise the Europe that we are building together from his remarks and description.
Clearly, we are not looking at matters from the same perspective.
(Laughter and applause)
In particular, he brought up the word 'federal' or 'federation' many times in his speech.
This is an old and very French argument that we have had in France and, indeed, it is based on the fact that the meaning we give this word in France differs from that given in other languages, especially German, and this interpretation has led to misunderstandings that have, of course, degenerated into arguments.
Both Charles Pasqua and I have served a man who we admired greatly, President Georges Pompidou, who was accustomed to saying, as he did not appreciate pointless arguments, "Federation, confederation or a federation, it is all a con federation in the end" .
(Laughter) Perhaps it was a rather provocative thing to say, but there was also an element of Cantal or Auvergne good sense behind this comment.
I would make a friendly suggestion that Charles Pasqua thinks about this.
(Laughter and applause)
Mr de Gaulle will probably understand that I do not share his views.
Once again I heard him out, but let me take the liberty of saying that there is one right that I am not prepared to grant him, and that is the right to claim to be speaking on behalf of General de Gaulle.
(Applause)
Last but not least, Mr Saint-Josse mentioned a number of matters which have already been touched upon, and I should just like to pick out one or two of the arguments he pointed out.
Firstly, cultural diversity and implementation of the principle of subsidiarity.
I unreservedly endorse the expression of this necessity, and the spirit thereof.
It is true that our cultural diversity is a source of wealth, and that the principle of subsidiarity is an absolute necessity.
Decisions must be taken at the right level.
Let us not go back over the past, or over a few examples that would make easy targets.
In order for the principle of subsidiarity to be properly applied, however, we need standard rules.
I am thinking of a specific decision taken by the Commission, and subsequently challenged, particularly on grounds of non-compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.
I observe, however, that it was the governments that asked the Commission to take this decision in the first place.
(Applause)There is therefore some ambiguity, if you will, and the more of us there are, the more essential it will be to enforce strict application of the principle of subsidiarity.
This, of course, means that there must be a standard set of rules to avoid any sort of ambiguity.
I repeat, and I said this in Berlin in another context and from another angle, we must be able to identify clearly who is responsible for doing what, otherwise it just will not work, as we saw in the example I mentioned just now.
(Applause)We must make ready to state clearly what Europe is doing, what each of the nations that make up Europe is doing, and what, within the nations, a number of administrative levels participating in the political and human life of these nations are doing.
I am thinking, for example, of the German Länder, but there are, of course, many other examples that could be cited.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have had the opportunity to make a few comments on the very interesting contributions made by the representatives of this House, and I thank you for the welcome you have given me here today.
(Loud applause)
I should like to thank the President, Mr Jacques Chirac, for the very full answers he has given the group chairmen in this House.
We shall carry on with our debate.
The President is forced to leave us because the family of the hostage held on Jolo, Sonia Wendling, asked to meet President Jacques Chirac, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, to see how all these poor hostages might be released as quickly as possible.
I am sure, Mr Hager, that you share the anxiety of these families.
Madam President, you could not be more wrong.
It is a matter of deep regret to me that the President-in-Office of the Council left the House just as the representative of the last group of delegates was about to speak, thereby registering his disinterest.
The honourable members are left wondering whether this is an act against the Independents or against the first Austrian representative to speak in this debate.
I fear that in behaving as he has done today, the President-in-Office of the Council, who spoke out against exclusion earlier on, is guilty of that very thing I therefore refuse to give my opinion on the programme of the French Council Presidency, owing to a suspected lack of interest, and I regret that such a signal has been sent out at the beginning of the Council Presidency.
In spite of the foregoing, being an optimist, I hope that in future this Council Presidency, like others before it, will take cognisance of its neutral position, and that at the end of the day, normality will also return to the group.
Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me, as president of the French delegation within the PPE-DE Group, to take the floor on the day that the French Presidency of the European Union presented its priorities.
In his speech last week in the Reichstag in Berlin, which was universally recognised as historic, the President-in-Office of the Council opened up new perspectives for the French Presidency, and also, I hope, for the presidencies which are to follow.
He not only asked the real questions as to why we should build Europe, who should be involved, and how it should be done, he also provided answers key to the future of a European Union embarking on an unprecedented enlargement.
To those who prefer to focus only on the short-term but certainly essential reforms that are awaiting the French Presidency and that must result in the future Treaty of Nice next December, I shall respond that these major reforms will only be achieved successfully if they are guided not only by modern European history, but also by an ambitious and realistic vision of what the Europe of tomorrow must be - a strong, democratic and free Europe that carries some weight in the eyes of the world.
We all know that in order to meet the considerable challenges which Europe faces today, we shall together have to work out how to clearly define our plan for Europe, all together.
We must be grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for having had both the courage and boldness to encourage our partners to engage in discussions but also to suggest the guidelines for these.
Our fellow citizens await a Europe which at last has the determination to review its modus operandi and to strive to achieve greater clarity, greater transparency and greater efficiency.
The reforms of the Commission and the Council must respond to these requirements.
We must keep in mind that, even if it is not an easy task, France and its partners are under an obligation to achieve results.
We must reach an agreement, and a good one at that.
Far from clouding the issue, today' s debate has offered some clarification as to the direction of the action to be undertaken in the months and years to come, which I shall sum up as follows: bringing Europe closer to the citizens, all the citizens without exception, be they close to the decision-making centres or remote, economic modernisation and a social Europe, efficiency and a strong presence in the world.
I have every confidence in Jacques Chirac, President-in-Office of the Council, and in his ability, along with our partners within the European Union, to meet these historic challenges.
Mr President, I have a point of order under Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure, which moreover is expressly quoted on page 25 of today' s agenda.
According to the schedule, the Council was to have 30 minutes' speaking time.
President Chirac spoke for one and a quarter hours.
According to the schedule, Members of Parliament were to be allowed to speak, but the President did not silence the people interrupting Mr de Gaulle.
Instead she cut his speech to a strict three minutes, even though she had allowed the other speakers an extra minute and, finally, she did not allow the speaker on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members to speak.
He was entitled to speak before the response from the President-in-Office of the Council.
The President has not fulfilled her obligation to run debates in this House objectively.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree on setting the course we are heading for beyond the French Presidency, but this forces us to mention the questions that will be raised, regardless of whether the intergovernmental conference is successful.
Our heading cannot be just the institutional construction which we know particularly appeals to the French.
It must also answer the question: what do we wish to achieve together?
Are we ready to draw the conclusions of the great leap forward undertaken by the French President' s predecessors?
I am thinking particularly of the matter of adopting the euro.
The questions that we must also answer are those that our fellow citizens are asking.
They aspire to see Europe operating better.
Whatever the advantages of talking about our visions for the future, right now we have to respond to the aspirations of the men and women who make up Europe, and in order to do so, all the members of the French executive must be involved in order to make a success of this presidency.
I believe that the projects undertaken by Lionel Jospin' s government, in France and in Europe, give the President-in-Office of the Council every opportunity to fulfil this objective.
We must also make a success of this agenda, and this means, first and foremost, making a success of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Key political questions will have to be settled, but if we want the European Union to be in a position to make decisions, then first and foremost we have to move into the realm of the qualified majority.
Moreover, Parliament requested that intensified cooperation be included on the intergovernmental conference agenda.
We are pleased to see that this has been possible.
We should like to see the right of veto cancelled for the transition to intensified cooperation, but this increased flexibility should not pave the way for an increasingly intergovernmental mode of operation.
Then, I should like to tell the French Presidency that it can count on Parliament' s support to prefer rather that we have no Nice Agreement than a mediocre Treaty.
Beyond the Intergovernmental Conference, we are also awaiting a review of the working methods and organisation of the European Union' s institutions.
We are thinking, obviously, of the reform underway within the Commission, but also and perhaps more importantly, within the Council.
The French Presidency has set itself the objective of placing Europe at the service of growth and full employment.
This is a renewed objective, for which we think a necessary objective is to step up work within the euro-11 group, soon to be the euro-12.
We are delighted that the French President has made a commitment to the greater visibility and authority of this body, which we consider to be a useful one.
As regards the social agenda, once again we are pleased to see that the prospect of full employment is henceforth seen as embracing the whole of the European Union.
We are delighted, moreover, to see the commitment of Lionel Jospin' s government to bring a number of essential directives to a successful conclusion.
I am thinking primarily of the directive on information and consultation of employees, as well as the working time directive for mobile workers.
The French President spoke of the Europe of men and women, the increased attention we must pay to the concerns of our fellow citizens.
In this respect, the work undertaken within the Convention on framing the Charter of Fundamental Rights is absolutely essential.
At the European Council in Biarritz, the Convention members will be ready to propose a comprehensive text which is to include economic and social rights.
However, the European Council will also have to be prepared for Parliament demanding time and again that the possibility of incorporating the Charter into the Treaty should be tabled.
We consider this to be an essential point.
What is the point in recognising rights if no legal recourse is possible?
With a view to creating a Europe that is closer to the citizens, I shall not go through the French Presidency' s entire programme, I have just two points to make.
One of these concerns the "money laundering" directive which, I believe, offers the progress that our fellow citizens wish to see.
They cannot comprehend our reluctance in this area.
In the field of reciprocal recognition of legal rulings, we are continually faced with situations where the divergent nature of our judicial structures involve our fellow citizens in serious personal deadlocks.
We need progress here.
Mr President, one final word to express how important we think it is that the French Presidency should also transform the acquis of the Treaty of Amsterdam on the subject of services of general interest.
These services of general interest contribute to the social and territorial cohesion of the European Union, as enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The test we are going to have to face in this respect concerns the directive on postal services.
Such services are also part of the modern world, for example Internet access for all.
We hope that the French Presidency will be able to propose a framework directive on this subject.
Mr President, the programme which the French President has just presented is both ambitious and realistic.
I was, however, hoping for a clearer commitment regarding the fundamental rights included in the Union' s agenda, for two reasons.
In the first place, these rights must be enshrined in the forthcoming Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In his speech, however, the President did not cite the examination of this charter as one of the main points of the European Council in Biarritz.
In his response to the first speakers, he suggested that there could be some discussion of a proposal for a charter in Biarritz, but with a content that, he is well aware, would make it almost impossible to incorporate into the Treaties at the European Council in Nice.
Is France, the homeland of human rights for two centuries, not going to set a more ambitious objective?
This would be a great disappointment.
In the second place, since Amsterdam, fundamental rights have formed the foundations of our Union and should represent the constant reference for any Member State action.
The creation of an area of freedom, justice and security is the most difficult undertaking before us, especially given that unanimity is still the rule.
This is a good subject of investigation for the intensified cooperation to which the President recently referred once again.
The President was the first to refer to the terms of Article 6 of the Treaty in connection with the Haider case.
In adopting such a stance, he set a very high standard, not just for the Austrian Government but, indirectly, for all the others too.
The measures the French Presidency has already announced in the areas of justice and home affairs appear to live up to this challenge.
They are, however, merely plans at this stage.
Let me therefore address the French Presidency with the words the Greeks used to address the most promising athlete in ancient times: hic rhodus, hic salta [here is your Colossus, now jump!].
Mr President, Minister, let me share a few comments with you in the intimate surroundings of the end of the day's sitting.
Apparently, Europe is some sort of vamp provoking everyone into political promiscuity.
I do not know, after listening to President Chirac' s comments, what political party he is going to wind up in at the end of his career, but the transformation is extraordinary, and it is true that we have taken twenty-one years to persuade President Chirac that Europe is something other than that which he believed when he made his Cochin address in 1978.
I should like to say that I am still convinced that we are not going to have to work so hard over such a long period to persuade Prime Minister Jospin to at last grasp the European cause firmly.
He is not always against it and it is safe to make minor observations like that without getting irritated!
I simply meant that I am convinced that it is no longer enough today to repeat things endlessly: President Chirac said many things that I agree with.
Ambitious, yes, it is ambitious, but let us see tangible proof of this ambition!
I am sorry, for example, that he did not repeat what he said in Berlin regarding the agenda for a constitution.
In Berlin, he said we should have enlargement plus constitution at the same time.
I would have liked him to say the same thing before this House: enlargement plus constitution, at the same time, so that we might have a constitution by 2003 or 2004 or 2005 as well as enlargement.
Secondly, speaking of a constitution, we must be careful not to be too naive.
Who does what?
It sounds good but what does it actually mean?
For Europe means shared authority, and increasingly shared authority: in other words, the constitution ought to tell us who does what, and how, together.
That is precisely the problem!
If it were quite as simple to perform political surgery, we would make faster progress.
And then I must say that, as Paul Lannoye said, I am saddened when I hear people discussing foreign policy and sparing no expense on arms and defence without even mentioning conflict prevention.
Europe' s role is also to invent an alternative foreign policy based specifically on preventing conflicts, on the need for ever fewer arms.
I am not saying that we do not need arms, I am not so naive, but I do not want European foreign policy to be exemplified merely by top fighter planes and soldiers obliged to go to Bosnia or Kosovo, but instead by our ability to prevent a conflict arising in Bosnia or Kosovo.
From this point of view, I would say that President Chirac is going in the right direction and I think that Prime Minister Jospin would be able to catch up with him if he were more clearly and resolutely pro-European.
Mr President, Minister, one presidency follows another, but, hearing Mr Chirac, we realise that the speeches and the pious hopes regarding exclusion remain the same.
It must, however, be noted that the fate of the fifty million poor people or the fifteen million unemployed people in Europe remains the same, whatever the presidency.
Europe is democratically bankrupt.
The operation of the institutions is quite outside the concerns and outside the control of the citizens.
Europe is a liberalising machine deregulating public services at the expense of the people' s basic needs.
Europe is a fortress favouring illegal trafficking in modern-day slaves, as the Dover tragedy showed.
The demonstrations in Seattle, Geneva and Millau, however, show that another sort of Europe, another sort of globalisation, is possible.
To achieve a democratic Europe, let us begin by bringing down the Schengen fortress and agreeing that all men and women have the same freedom of movement as capital, and let us regularise the situation of illegal immigrants.
To achieve a social Europe, let us begin by banning layoffs on the part of firms in profit.
Finally, to achieve a Europe of justice and solidarity, let us begin by setting up, and not just talking about, a Tobin tax, up to a level that would make it possible to guarantee the subsistence of the billions of children and adults totally without resources.
For the people, these requirements are the priorities in the debate, which is certainly needed, on the weighting of votes or the right of veto.
Mr President, Minister, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals in the TDI Group who, as everyone knows, are European federalists.
For this reason, we will be paying extremely close attention to any institutional steps towards closer cooperation, which must be clearly and firmly established within the Community framework.
I shall use my speaking time, however, to remind you that this Parliament asked the IGC to grant Parliament the right finally to decide on its own location.
This is a fundamental right, and three hundred Members of this House, moreover, made it very clear that they are unhappy about being forced to come to Strasbourg twelve times a year.
I hope that the French Presidency will take due account of this issue, which we consider to be extremely important.
It is no coincidence that the Friday sitting has been abolished, Minister.
It is because many Members of this Parliament are fed up with the problems they experience in getting to Strasbourg and in working properly in these conditions.
Mr President, in view of the way in which the list of speakers has been manipulated today in order to put paid to my colleague Mr Hager, I have only this to say to you: if the Austrian referee Benko had broken all the rules in the game between France and Portugal, as Madam President has done today, then France would not even have reached the final.
That is the funny side of it.
The less amusing aspect of the conflict we are engaged in today is that there are several hundred delegates sitting here who are actually willing to accept this without protest!
Mr President, we are delighted with what Mr Chirac, the President-in-Office of the Council, has said at a time when we have the strong feeling that there is a deep crisis in Europe and when we would like to know where we stand.
I should like to discuss the three factors which I think are at the root of the crisis in Europe today.
The first is a profound questioning of all the institutional players in Europe; the second factor is the distance and the lack of understanding that separate the general public from the European institutions, and the third factor, which is the key to the first two, is a loss of perspective.
For a long time, we in Europe felt that we knew where we were going.
This is no longer the case.
That is why many of us welcomed the speech made by the President of the French Republic to the Reichstag, particularly his decision to declare the European Constitution to be the key to all future mechanisms for change.
Today, he has chosen not to use the same words.
Many of us regret this because we feel that his statement that the ideas he expressed in the Reichstag went beyond the French Presidency of the Union, represents a fresh approach.
We feel instead that the issue of Europe' s prospects, the issue of the architecture of a new Europe and the issue of the future European Constitution belong right at the heart of the French Presidency of the Union.
These are not secondary or incidental issues, to be addressed at a later date; they should be addressed as a matter of priority and are at the heart of the discussions that we will be holding.
If we are unable to respond to the issue of Europe' s prospects, we will not be able to respond to the technical issues that face us.
This would be a missed opportunity for us.
I shall sum this up in one sentence: work on the Constitution and therefore on Europe' s prospects must be clearly launched during the French Presidency.
It must be launched at Nice.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the French President has introduced the French Presidency' s substantial programme to us today and it would be impossible for me to cover even a fraction of the points in four minutes.
But what I would say is that, as I see it, there are three aspects which the French Presidency is going to successfully take forward.
Firstly, it will raise the profile of the 11, or soon to be 12, Members of the euro-zone.
This will entail providing our single currency with political support, and I have every sympathy for the French Council Presidency' s desire to raise the profile of this political support for the euro whilst fully upholding the independence of the European Central Bank.
What is more, if we were to coordinate budgetary policy and harmonise taxation policy more effectively, it would help to stabilise the single currency.
But I would add that if we were to strengthen the euro-zone in this way, then this would be a topical example, and also one of the most important examples, as it were, of reinforced cooperation within the context of the Treaty.
That is absolutely fine.
But then I would also want to see France acting with true pioneering spirit, although in matters pertaining to the implementation of the directive on the internal market, France belongs to the rearguard.
After all, we have some catching up to do there, particularly where the implementation of Community legislation in France is concerned.
France, along with Greece, Portugal and Luxembourg are in the rearguard on this count, and not the vanguard.
I would be only too pleased for it to be otherwise.
My second point concerns reinforced cooperation in the construction of a European Union of security and defence.
I wholeheartedly agree with you when you say that the European Union must have all the means and instruments at its disposal that it needs to pursue a truly common foreign and security policy worthy of the name, which also means strengthening our military capability and establishing the political and military structures we need for a common foreign and security policy.
Of course my third point concerns the agreement reached by the 15 Member States in Nice on reforming the institutions and the decision-making processes within the European Union.
I have two fundamental comments to make in this connection.
Our aim, from which we must not be deflected, must be to preserve the unity of the institutions.
The European Union does not need new institutions, it needs institutions that operate better and are able to make decisions more effectively than is the case at present.
That is one aspect, and the second is this: although it may be true that as a European Parliament we could have wished for a broader agenda, it is more important to make substantial progress in the points that are on the agenda now.
The future size of the Commission is important in this respect, but it is not central.
The new weighting of votes in the Council is also important for striking a new balance between large and small, North and South and rich and poor within the Union, but that is not crucial either.
The spotlight is on the extension of majority voting.
I would hope, assuming France and Germany have already moved closer together - which I welcome with open arms of course that these two countries will stick together over the issue of extending majority voting in the Council, and set an example, so as to progress beyond the status quo, because so far, the 15 have been able to reach agreement on just two areas.
President-in-Office of the Council, majority decisions in the Council imply co-decision rights for the European Parliament.
There must be an inextricable link between the extension of majority decisions and the grant of co-decision rights to the European Parliament over the European Union' s entire legislative programme.
Mr President, Mr President, the French presidency' s programme is interesting and in no way devoid of substance.
There is a lot one can agree with.
I nonetheless wonder whether it is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity to talk about housing, health care and sport.
Ought the EU really to be devoting itself to those kinds of issue?
The idea of a community of values is important, but opinions are divided on how this is to be achieved.
Many of us are disappointed at Prime Minister Jospin' s statement to the effect that there will be no change during the French presidency when it comes to the 14 countries' boycott of Austria.
The intensive discussion in recent weeks of our visions of Europe' s future has been stimulating, but it causes disquiet in the candidate States.
Where exactly does the EU stand?
This is an issue to which Mr Cox also referred.
The unclear signals give scope to populists with nationalist agendas in the candidate States who want to prevent their countries from becoming Members of the Union.
Was it a coincidence that no statement was made at Feira to the effect that we should be ready for enlargement by the year 2002?
Does the French presidency' s policy concerning a further Intergovernmental Conference at the end of 2003 or the beginning of 2004 imply support for Chancellor Schröder' s proposal for a new conference on the division of labour?
Even in that case, the signals are unclear, which is alarming for the candidate States.
To conclude, I would point to one instance of unilateral action which is worrying.
Why did France discontinue Slovakia' s membership of the OECD, citing the EU' s directive on TV issues?
Was it right to do this off its own bat, without checking what the other Member States thought?
What was the reason for its action?
This has also given rise to concern in the candidate States about the attitude we take to their legislation and to their legitimate interest in being involved in OECD cooperation, which is economically important.
Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency' s ship is heavily-laden and we hope, particularly having heard Mr Chirac' s answers, that it arrives safely in Nice, in six months.
Nice is founded on an ancient Phoenician settlement, originally named Nicaia, meaning victory, and we are certainly expecting victory on the part of the French Presidency, both for the current citizens of the Union and for those who will be joining it.
We were pleased to note the Presidency' s will, ambition and clear-sightedness, particularly with regard to the contradictions inherent in some of our European policies.
Global warming is one such problem.
Like a sword of Damocles, it hangs over not only the Union, but over the whole world.
Integrating this essential factor into all European policies is the political challenge to which we must respond.
I am not convinced that this is the direction we are currently taking, in spite of all the fine words that have been spoken here this morning.
Mr President, the historical issue concerning the French Presidency, for I do feel that it is a historical issue, is first and foremost to open up the way for the construction of a Europe for all Europeans.
We invited the new democracies in Eastern Europe to join us now that they have put the ordeal of Communism behind them and we were right to do so.
Nevertheless, we were fully aware that we would not fit greater Europe into the institutions of little Europe.
Since then we have dawdled and dragged our feet over the reform of these institutions.
Ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall and one year after the Helsinki decisions on enlargement, I see the new Intergovernmental Conference under the French Presidency as the kick-start that all Europeans expect of Europe.
I say this because it is not only the size of Europe that is changing; it is also its very nature.
If we consider Europe as a whole, we must define Europe and define its borders, its values and the European project.
Any definition of borders raises the problem of Turkey, which, to my mind, should become an associate country rather than a fully integrated one.
We must also think of Europe in a different light, not as a huge nation-state, with a super-government, a super-president, a super-administration or even a super-tax.
Instead, we should see Europe as the construction of an area of genuine federalism, which protects the diversity of people and of nations, which has a clear constitution that defines and limits the powers of Europe and which applies the principle of subsidiarity and ensures that this will be strictly complied with.
Today, the French Presidency has an obligation to achieve results.
As the French President said, unless the IGC is successful, there is no point in thinking about the following stages.
A review of decision-making mechanisms in order to prevent paralysis and a review of the functioning of the Council and the Commission are all on the agenda and I think that the projects for tomorrow and beyond must not conceal what is required today.
The success of the IGC now will actually be the best basis on which to build the huge project for the greater Europe of tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the French Presidency is going to be a particularly busy one.
The Portuguese Presidency has done a great job and achieved major, innovative results at the Lisbon Summit.
Now the Member States of the Union need to implement the results swiftly.
However, not enough progress is being made at the IGC.
There is a need for stronger political will and for the political level of the negotiations on reforming the Union to be raised immediately.
It is therefore important that the debate on the future structure of the Union has been reopened following the positions adopted by Minister Joshka Fischer.
Now, the first task must be to define at Nice certain priority issues referred to by President Chirac in his introductory speech, such as closer cooperation, the adoption of majority voting as the rule and the adoption of a decisive Charter on Fundamental Rights which will be included in the Treaties.
This would be a basic step towards defining a European Constitution.
We feel that these decisions are crucial in terms of the reform of the Union: without them any discussion of its structure will be academic, and it is clear that, now that the single currency and the Central Bank have been established, Europe is in need of new political unity and, as has been said, a fresh boost for economic growth and social cohesion.
President Prodi reiterated these points.
I therefore feel that we can assure the French Presidency that we will make every effort to make these next six months a success: we are aware that there are considerable political differences between the countries and that now is the time to adopt clear positions.
In our opinion, there is a clear dividing line between those who want enlargement to bring less political integration and those who consider that greater political integration and clearly defined timeframes will be necessary.
We feel that opinion is also divided over the form that the Union' s institutions should take after enlargement.
There would appear to be a choice between developing the supranational components - strengthening the role of Parliament and the Commission - and enhancing the intergovernmental aspects.
We would like to make it possible for the countries who so desire to cooperate more closely to present a united front in a number of sectors such as economic and monetary union, which is still far from being fully achieved, internal security, and defence and foreign policy, which represents an open, dynamic core of more advanced integration.
As regards management of the economy, we support the establishment of a Euro-12, for we feel that, with the introduction of the euro, this is necessary for the Central Bank as well.
We consider it essential to maintain the fundamental goals of the European Social Model - adapting it, of course, to the diversification requirements determined by the new economy - and introducing new forms of flexibility which are different from those governing the labour market: flexibility which makes its own rules.
We believe in increased synergy between the European Parliament and national parliaments, but we are against commingling which undermines the fundamental consideration that the European Parliament is the parliamentary organ of supranationality elected by direct universal suffrage.
I would like to make one last point regarding the European Union' s role in the international institutions.
President Chirac delivered a highly Europeanist speech to the Bundestag, and committed himself to revitalising the development of the European Union and providing it with a Constitution voted in by the European citizens.
We support these proposals.
President Chirac once again expressed French support for the German application for a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council, confirming his intention to strengthen the French-German axis in the context of a purely intergovernmental vision of the future structure of the European Union.
For a long time we have felt a review of the membership of the Security Council to be necessary, but we consider that it would be more appropriate for representation to the Council to be by major continents, such as Africa, South America and Europe.
Since we feel that the intergovernmental, supranational and parliamentary aspects should be balanced within Europe, we consider that it is the European Union as a whole which should be represented at the Security Council.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen, the requests, proposals and projects presented during these past weeks by Mr Fischer, Mr Bayrou, Mr Monti and Mr Védrine and by President Chirac in Berlin, and Mr Chirac' s speeches here today are all evidence of the fact that, despite setbacks and despite our differences, we have entered a new stage of European construction.
The positive results we hope for from the Intergovernmental Conference should allow us to proceed to the necessary reform of the institutions in preparation for enlargement.
In this context, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament will each have to play an equally important and equally influential role, but these roles must include active cooperation.
It is the citizens who are calling for it, the citizens who are the true protagonists of the Europe of today, but, more importantly, the protagonists of the Europe of tomorrow, an enlarged, integrated Europe which is capable of meeting the challenge of globalisation.
The success of the euro will not be sufficient on its own for us to hold our ground against the United States and the China of tomorrow.
It is true that we must move forward in the area of the common foreign and security policy and support our currency politically as well, but progress has to be made in the defence of the fundamental values of our Union, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights must reflect this.
It is the duty of confirmed Europeanists such as ourselves, who believe in the social market economy, to fight the scourge of unemployment, and in order to do this Europe must encourage the small and medium-sized businesses and foster the development of trade, agriculture, tourism and craft trades, but, in the context of subsidiarity, it must also reduce the burden of taxation.
However, as President Chirac stressed, we must educate our young people, prepare them for the challenge of globalisation, and not only from a professional and cultural point of view.
We must educate young people to stand up for principles, and the fight against drugs and the development of the social function of sport may well play a significant part in this.
But, Mr President, the best results take time to achieve: they are like mosaics, built one piece at a time.
Yet are we sure that this Presidency will achieve the goals it has set itself just because it is French and France was one of the founder countries of the Union?
It will have the sure political and parliamentary support of the Forza Italia delegation in the PPE-DE Group, for the Italy of today and of tomorrow will certainly be a protagonist in the construction of that Europe in which we all believe so strongly.
Mr President, what a change we have seen from Mr Chirac' s speech of a few years ago!
He is a President who in fact started out as an extreme eurosceptic, if I may use such an expression, but today he has made a truly European speech, which was applauded equally by the left and the right in this Parliament.
I feel that I must congratulate the Socialist government on having convinced the French President so thoroughly.
It is greatly to the President' s credit that he used words which sometimes tend to divide us.
I am thinking here of the word 'federalism' , and he said that everything depends on what one means by this.
That is precisely the problem with several words that are used in the current debate.
The European Union has always had certain federalist characteristics such as qualified majority voting instead of unanimity in decision making within the Council; a directly elected Parliament, an executive Commission which is independent from governments;
Community law which takes precedence over national law, amongst other things.
All of these are federal characteristics.
On the other hand, the European Union is a long way from being a centralised federation, like many of the world' s federations.
This is a decentralised federation in which the Member States play an extremely important role in decision-making and remain in control of the Treaties.
All this ambiguity means that we should perhaps not allow issues of terminology or theology to divide us, but should instead unite on the specific changes that we need to make to the system.
The same applies to the word "constitution" , which can also evoke quite different things.
As a citizen of the United Kingdom, a country which does not even have any kind of written or codified constitution, I should like to ask the following question: what is a constitution?
This depends on what you mean.
People interpret things differently and, with this word too, we run the risk of allowing vocabulary and theology, if I may use that term, to divide us, instead of uniting over the content.
To some extent, we already have a constitution, which consists of the Treaties.
The Treaties, after all, define the Union' s sphere of competences, the powers of its institutions and the procedures for adopting legislation or the budget.
To some extent, therefore, they form a "constitution" .
Mr Pasqua defined the constitution as the foundation of a new legal order.
Is this not precisely what we have founded in Europe?
Instead of allowing ourselves to become divided by the philosophical point of what makes a constitution, we should look at how our present constitution needs to be improved.
First, it must be more readable and easier to use by consumers, i.e. the general public.
The European University Institute in Florence has submitted a fine project for our consideration, which makes our Treaties considerably shorter, more readable and easier to use, without even altering their content.
We must also look at the changes we need to make to our constitution.
On this subject, we must above all do what President Chirac suggested, which is to ensure that, in a Union of almost 30 members, there is no risk of action being blocked.
This is not really a question of creating a hard core.
There is no hard core.
What is a fact, however, is that certain areas, or certain States, sometimes create delays, which are sometimes temporary.
There is therefore no need to create a hard core and we should instead create a situation in which our constitution prevents action being blocked.
We therefore need to strengthen qualified majority voting, to extend it as far as possible, and where this is not possible, to return to the issue of closer cooperation.
These are the two crucial points for the IGC.
Concentrate on these and above all, do so before enlargement.
Do this at Nice then, and not afterwards.
Mr President, I congratulate the French Presidency of the European Union on its ambitious approach in all areas and for its intention not to end the Intergovernmental Conference with a minimal agreement, but with results which make enlargement a real possibility.
Due to time restrictions, I will only refer to three points.
Firstly, closer cooperation and integration.
They will only be useful, Mr President, if four conditions are met: firstly, the Community dimension of the Union must be increased, rather than the intergovernmental dimension; there must be more integration, not more cooperation.
Secondly, the existing institutions must be used, not replaced with new bodies.
Thirdly, we should not have cooperation or integration of a variable composition, since that would mean a Europe á la carte, that is to say, an ungovernable Europe.
Fourthly, in the same way, we should prevent this leading to factions or closed blocs which would divide the Union.
In other words, we want closer integration which is open to all current and future members of the Union.
My second point relates to the functioning of the Euro-12, which must be improved, but not by reducing further the current democratic deficit.
The Commission must therefore have genuine powers for making proposals, and not only for recommendation, and Parliament must participate seriously, starting with consultation, but extending to codecision.
My third point, Mr President, is that I am also one of those who believes that we need a Constitution for the Union.
My question is, why not take a first step now by approving the basic treaty prepared in Florence on the initiative of the Commission?
This does not change anything, but it does mean something very important: that the citizens may finally become aware of which system is governing them.
It would at least be a step forward in terms of this clarification which we are all requesting, but which we never get to see, at least with regard to something which must not be forgotten, Mr President, i.e. the distribution of competences in the European Union.
We are leaving it for the future.
Is the ratification process in certain countries not going to jeopardise this?
I leave that question open.
I will end here.
The ambitions are fine, but we want facts and we expect to see them at the end of the French Presidency.
Mr President, since we are in the run-up to the Treaty of Nice and since we have had the pleasure of reading a number of valuable speeches by Mr Joschka Fischer and President Chirac, it may be a novel idea for Germany and France to share the Union' s presidency for a year.
But under one proviso: that a fundamental breakthrough be reached in the field of European cooperation in line with all these fine speeches we have had the pleasure to hear and read.
This is not only meant as a pleasant intro, because what I want to establish above all is that the French-German axis should not only generate philosophies for the future but should also solve the institutional problems of today and tomorrow.
Whatever happens in Nice, decisions need to be taken on decision making.
As we see it, all European legislation, which does not affect the constitutions of the Member States, should be decided on by qualified majority, with codecision from Parliament.
In addition, decisions need to be taken on vote weighting and as we see it, it should be the size of the population in the Member States, as is the case in this House, that is the deciding factor.
Decisions need to be taken regarding the number of Commissioners - in our opinion, this should be one per Member State - and on the number of MEPs - we said a long time ago, 700 is more than enough.
Also, decisions need to be taken on the Court of Justice and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
I completely echo Mr Gil-Robles' views that this should be included in the Treaties and that cooperation should be stepped up.
As far as the latter is concerned, it is vital that we tackle the Union' s structure.
Both Mr Joschka Fischer and President Chirac are right in this.
I am not averse to a federal structure for the European Union.
It could even be termed confederation, as President Chirac said earlier today.
It is high time that we had a European constitution which is organised in the way that the university of Florence recently proposed.
It is high time Mr Prodi had the authority and rights which a European government should in fact have.
It is also high time we had a bicameral system, but not of the kind proposed by Mr Joschka Fischer, with a European Parliament, as we have now, and a second parliament comprising representatives of the parliaments of the respective Member States.
It would be far better to convert the European Council of Ministers to a kind of Federal Council.
Interestingly, this is a term which Mr Chirac used in his response to the questions.
Surely this is the most natural way to provide Europe with a bicameral system consisting of a parliament and senate.
All we need to do is to turn the European Council into a senate.
Finally, such a constitution should very clearly and precisely define Europe' s and the Member States' respective remits.
As far as I am concerned, the European package as a whole could quite easily be fleshed out a little bit and the powers of the European Member States could be increased once again, as long as it is clear what is European and what is national, and as long as we find our way out of the diffuse intergovernmental and Community structure in which we find ourselves at present.
It would be ideal if the decision was taken in Nice to devise a project of this kind in two to three years' time.
I hope that the words of Mr Joschka Fischer and those of Mr Chirac will not remain words but will be turned into action.
I should appreciate a reaction from both honourable gentlemen who stayed behind during lunch.
Mr President, Minister, the French Presidency has committed itself to a courageous, ambitious, brilliant agenda, considering some of the difficulties we are experiencing at this time.
The important aspect of President Chirac' s speech was, we felt, our common values and intentions.
In our opinion, a Europe which builds its future with constancy, continuity and responsibility is the best guarantee that the founding fathers' blueprint is implemented faithfully, that the endeavours of all those who have worked on it over the past 50 years are at the basis of its success and that Europe is built on solid foundations.
It seems appropriate to break down the complex problem of the institutions: we must conclude the IGC on the three topics left over from Amsterdam and closer cooperation.
This is the only way we can move forward in the intense debate on the future of the European Union and reconcile the economic development of Europe with the strengthening of the European Social Model and with the fight against social exclusion and modern forms of poverty, in order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, step up negotiations on enlargement and increasingly consolidate the European Union' s role in the world.
In this context, we consider it essential to reinforce the European Commission, a supranational, independent body, the full expression of the unique characteristics of the structure of the European institutions.
Enlargement is the conclusion of a political process which began with the reconciliation of the countries of Western Europe 50 years ago.
This historic event must not be dismissed by replacing the Berlin wall with another wall, the wall of specific interests, egoism and bureaucracy.
However, as the French Presidency rightly pointed out, enlargement must not weaken the Union' s action either.
Mr Chirac' s words on the future of the European Union are reassuring, particularly because he spoke of a new stage which would start after the conclusion of the IGC, on subjects such as the consolidation of legitimate democracy in decisions, security and defence, the accentuation of the unique characteristics of the European institutions, a clear definition of responsibilities and the consolidation of the principle of subsidiarity, matters which cannot be ignored in the near future.
The subject of closer cooperation has been widely debated and disputed.
It used to be known as the 'two speed' Europe and is now referred to as the 'hard core' .
Some see it as an opportunity and some as a threat.
In any case, all are in agreement that this situation should not lead to division but should spur us on to reach together those new frontiers which the current European model does not allow us to reach but which, in the future, it will have to.
I would inform our French friends that Italy, which has been at the forefront of the European project ever since the beginning and which, we hope, is soon to enter a period of political stability, will be become increasingly active, implementing tangible actions, alongside the countries which sincerely desire to reinforce the Union' s foundations and to achieve the most important and ambitious cooperation objectives.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I shall not speak for long, so as not to delay even further the lunchtime of those Members who are still present.
First of all, I wish to say how delighted I am to be here with you and to be speaking on behalf of the French Government, since I was a Member of the European Parliament, before it was located in this superb hemicycle - between 1994 and 1997.
I should like to thank the numerous speakers who have expressed their thoughts, all of which were extremely useful, and particularly those who spoke in French, although it is not their mother tongue.
More specifically, I should also like to acknowledge the encouragement given to the French Government by Pervenche Berès and Klaus Hänsch, as well as the ambition sought by some speakers, such as Mr Watson.
I would also like to reassure Mr Cohn-Bendit with regard to the vision that drives my government and which has perhaps made an effective contribution to certain positions.
This presidency is being held against the backdrop of a vast movement, which has two components.
Firstly, we are in the process of preparing for an enlarged Europe, the united Europe of tomorrow and, as Mr Madelin said, this may involve changing the nature of the Union in addition to changing its size.
Secondly, we must bring this Europe closer to its citizens and ensure that it goes further towards fulfilling their aspirations.
It is quite clear that, in the wider debate on this issue, there are two phases.
There is the shorter-term phase of this Presidency, which is taking place at a pivotal and undoubtedly decisive moment, and then there is the longer-term phase, in which broader approaches will be outlined and in which the future of Europe will really take shape.
Here I am talking about a Europe of thirty Members.
Unlike Mr Bayrou, I do not think that it is fair, appropriate or timely today to eradicate these two phases, as it were, and to introduce them both under the French Presidency, because that would entail the risk of complicating the outcome of the IGC or, quite the opposite, to minimise this outcome, and ensure that it would only appear as an annex.
Let us focus on the task in hand.
Let us see this IGC through with ambition.
In doing so we will have established the basis which will enable us to move further towards European construction.
What will we be doing, specifically in this IGC?
Our position is quite clear.
It is our view that the IGC must succeed, that it is absolutely crucial that it succeeds, but not at any price.
Our obligation concerns the means, not the outcome.
As Mr Barón Crespo said just now, we want a "nice treaty" in Nice, which means a good treaty, not any old treaty.
As Mr Corbett pointed out, it is true that the most important points are, in particular, the extension of qualified majority voting, which generally goes hand in hand with codecision with the European Parliament, and closer cooperation, because this is a bridge between the first and second stages, between the present and the future, since it improves the functioning of the European Union and because it enables us to think about the Europe of tomorrow.
At the same time, however, the French Presidency considers all these things to be connected.
Now, following the Feira European Council, and we are delighted that this is the case, four issues have been raised and we must reach a substantial agreement on all of them, by which I mean all four of these questions, and not only concentrate on one or other of them.
That is why we will be changing our working methods.
We intend to apply ourselves to this task, fully aware that it will be difficult, and we offer our thanks, of course, to the Portuguese Presidency, which has prepared the groundwork very well for us.
We shall work with determination, specifically by taking the negotiation into a more political phase, which will perhaps be more ambitious.
To this extent, Mr Hänsch is right: the Franco-German partnership that has been re-established and the Franco-German ambition that has been recharged will prove extremely useful.
With regard to the Charter, I must pay tribute to the work carried out by President Herzog and to the Convention.
This is a very original type of body, which brings together members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, representatives of Member States and of course, a representative of the Commission.
I wish to assure the European Parliament that this Charter is one of our priorities and we hope that the Convention will prove worthy of the task so that we will be able to discuss it in detail at the Biarritz European Council, with a view, as the French President has said, to making as much progress as possible with the content.
I am aware of the more or less unanimous feeling of the European Parliament about the restrictive nature of this Charter.
We shall see how much arbitration is required, but the French Presidency takes the view that priority should be given to the substance of this issue, given that any kind of text will be a source of inspiration for all of the European Union' s institutions.
Beyond these issues lies that of the European Union' s constitutional prospects.
The first problem with this issue is the agenda, which I think would be difficult to set at this stage.
The important thing is to pursue this idea whilst seeking to define its outlines more clearly and whilst thinking about the best method for continuing this exchange of ideas.
Like Mr Corbett once again, I feel that we must realise that the term "constitution" may mean the will to speed up European construction and European ambition, but that the term "constitutional" leads, and will inevitably lead, to debate, because it could give rise to, or be nourished and fed by, or include, contents which may turn out to be rather different.
Several Members of this Parliament have proposed that we should start by adopting the study carried out by the European University Institute in Florence.
From what I have seen, they are certainly interesting, at least at this early stage, but I am bound to say that they will require a thorough examination.
The Commission will shortly be giving its opinion on this study, Mr President, next week, I believe.
Member States will also have to study this document, which inevitably raises many questions.
It makes some useful contributions, but, at the same time, the question of whether it really simplifies the situation remains.
This is an important matter that cannot be taken lightly and that is certainly not what the French Presidency will be doing.
To conclude, I shall just make two observations on issues that have been raised by two Members of this Parliament, specifically Mrs Isler Béguin, who talked about environmental problems.
Our commitment to firmer Union action with regard to the environment and our will to put the conclusions of the Kyoto Summit into practice should not be underestimated.
I also wish to say that, with regard to the size of the environmental dimension in all policies, the French Presidency will fulfil its obligations during these six months, in collaboration with the Swedish Presidency, which will follow us, to ensure that continuity is maintained
I shall now finish, but nobody in this place will be surprised, particularly coming from me, if I say a few words about Strasbourg, specifically in response to Mr dell' Alba.
We have taken note of the fact that the European Parliament voted to remove Friday mornings from the part-session.
I will say quite frankly that the result of the vote gave us cause for regret and we hope that this is not an attempt to whittle away at Strasbourg' s role or to revive the issue of Parliament' s location.
I shall say quite clearly that France, - and here once again for a moment I am speaking on behalf of a major national delegation in the Council - would not be able to accept this.
We should really stop endlessly trying to keep the debate on Strasbourg alive.
The Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Amsterdam, are very clear on this point.
Instead, we should concentrate on the practical, material aspects of the issue.
I am fully aware of the problems encountered by some Members of the European Parliament and I must tell you that the French authorities are extremely sensitive to these issues.
We are anxious to see improved air connections to Strasbourg.
Through the Presidency of the European Parliament, we have sent a questionnaire to Members, in order to find out their specific, individual needs.
We hope that we will have a large response.
We are also considering establishing a cross-border platform to coordinate neighbouring airports, which will make it easier to reach Strasbourg, both by air and by road.
Honourable Members of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, these are some of my thoughts, certainly not all of them, that have been stimulated by this debate, which was of extremely high quality and very encouraging for our Presidency.
Knowing that they both have pressing engagements I should like to pay particular thanks to Mr Moscovici and President Prodi for staying with us until the end of the debate.
Thank you very much.
(The sitting was suspended at 2 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Delegation of EU observers at the Zimbabwean elections
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for the fact that we are starting a few minutes late.
However, there has been an important trialogue meeting, which the representative of the Council, Minister Moscovici, had to attend, and because he was held up, we have waited for him.
He will have no chance at all to acclimatise because we are going to start straightaway with the statements from the Council and the Commission on the delegation of EU observers at the Zimbabwean elections, as per the agenda.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Commissioners, please forgive me first of all for my lateness, which is not due to any lunchtime whim but simply to the fact that Jacques Chirac, the French President, was with us.
Mrs Fontaine accompanied him, which prolonged the essential trialogue that we held with Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, by a few minutes.
Zimbabwe is experiencing a serious economic, social and political crisis.
Despite some infringements of human rights, which have been rightly condemned by the international community, the country has remained, in essence, under the rule of law.
It has been able to do so largely because of the dynamism of civil society and of the independence of its judicial system.
Over the last three years, a reversal in its external economic situation has weakened its economic fabric, which is structured but ageing.
Shifts towards authoritarianism and lax management of the economy have continued to tarnish the country' s image, undermined the confidence of the community of sponsors and has encouraged the people to challenge the government.
This discontent was expressed in February' s referendum on the constitution, which was the first time that the Presidential party had lost an election since independence in 1980.
Legislative elections were therefore a major issue for the ruling party.
In order to hamper the success of the opposition, the ruling party risked heightening tensions by conducting a tough election campaign and by making the unequal distribution of farmland the issue for mobilising the rural world and veterans of the war of independence.
With regard to this issue, the Head of State has allowed a huge movement for the occupation of properties to develop and has halted the legal framework for future compulsory purchases.
These shifts, which I have just mentioned, have resulted in the deaths of 33 people, they have made the economic crisis worse and have distorted fair competition in the elections, thereby creating a real risk of instability in southern Africa.
The European Union nevertheless considered it important that elections should be held and that the results should be credible and acceptable.
It therefore sought the agreement of the Zimbabwean authorities to send, as far in advance of the elections as possible, a large mission of nearly 200 observers, thereby demonstrating the Union' s interest in seeing democracy consolidated in that country.
Nobody can deny the fact that this presence contributed to reducing tensions and to restoring a climate, which was as conducive as possible, in such a highly sensitive context, to the free expression of the whole population' s right to vote.
I wish at this point to pay tribute to Mr Schori, who led this mission, and to the remarkable work accomplished by his team.
Although our observers noted that the degree of violence, irregularities and intimidation in the period leading up to the elections meant that the words 'free and honest' could not be applied to the fifth legislative elections in the history of Zimbabwe, they nevertheless emphasised the efficient organisation of the voting itself, the large turnout - I believe it was the largest since independence was achieved - and the peaceful atmosphere in which it took place.
The vote-counting processes were not cause for controversy either.
On behalf of the European Union, I should also like to congratulate the Zimbabwean people, who, by taking part in these elections in such numbers, have proved their determination to take their destiny into their hands in a peaceful and democratic way.
I am also pleased to note that the results of the elections have been universally accepted by all participating parties.
The entry into Parliament of a significant opposition - in fact it almost has a majority in the seats that were contested in these elections - suggests that constructive debates will be held.
Zimbabwe has undoubtedly turned a new page in its young history.
The fundamental problems still remain, of course, and they remain intact.
This is why the Union is urging all political forces in Zimbabwe to mobilise and to bring together the threads of dialogue, in order to set the country firmly on the road to recovery.
The Union hopes that the new government will adopt, with the help of the country' s new representatives, credible measures for getting the economy back on its feet, measures which are likely to restore the confidence of local operators and of donors.
For twenty years, the European Union has shown itself to be Zimbabwe' s leading partner in its development.
Zimbabwe is a friendly country and a partner country under the Lomé Convention and the European Union hopes to continue this policy, with acknowledged respect for human rights, for democratic principles and for the primacy of law.
Because the Union wishes to continue to intervene on behalf of those who have been worst affected by the crisis, it is particularly willing to provide assistance for the necessary land reform in order to reduce poverty, despite the fact that this has not been implemented in an orderly, transparent or rational way.
The European Union wants to believe in the future of a democratic and prosperous Zimbabwe, which is a factor for the stability and the harmonious development of southern Africa.
Mr President, first of all may I say that I would have been delighted on this occasion to have spoken after Mr Schori who has obviously done an outstanding job - as the presidency said - in Zimbabwe.
I think all of us who wish Zimbabwe well would want to congratulate him and all those who were in the EU observation team.
They have all done a magnificent job.
They clearly managed to fulfill their objectives under very difficult circumstances and they discharged their mandate in an extremely effective way.
The mobilisation of a full and experienced team on the ground less than four weeks after an informal decision by European Union foreign ministers is a tribute to the enormous efforts of everyone concerned.
This and the professionalism of the observation mission enabled them to surmount numerous political hurdles.
It made the operation a reference point for electoral observation in countries in crisis.
It is widely acknowledged that the European Union mission contributed to reducing the levels of violence, and I think it is also recognised that it helped to build up the confidence of civil society during the elections.
Once again may I stress that the reputation of Mr Schori and the role that he played were key factors in our judgment for the success of the mission.
I believe that the mission constituted the most credible observer voice during these critical times in Zimbabwe.
This was reflected in extensive press coverage during the whole period, both locally and internationally.
What is more the European Union mission being by far the largest observer mission deployed in the country and operational right across the nation, also contributed significantly to the coordination of the overall electoral monitoring effort in Zimbabwe.
We have of course had a chance of becoming acquainted with the main outlines of the report, though we are looking forward to the opportunity of studying it in detail.
I know that the first part of the report follows the interim report which the honourable Member made, and is an account of the violence and intimidation which sadly marked the early stages of the election campaign.
We know from what he has said that the report analyses the voting process and the conduct of the poll and I think - though I would not want to take words out of his mouth - that by and large the actual conduct of the poll seems to have been pretty satisfactory.
Finally, and most importantly, and this is what we are looking forward to hearing from the honourable Member, the report focuses on the consequences for Zimbabwe's future.
The honourable gentlemen is right to recommend that the European Union should in the coming weeks and months monitor very carefully what is happening in Zimbabwe and provide assistance and support wherever it is appropriate for us to do so.
We would certainly want to endorse this, and my colleague Commissioner Nielson and I will certainly intensify our efforts to strengthen channels of communication, both formal and informal, with President Mugabe and his government, to facilitate the transition to effective multi-party democracy.
The honourable Member has spoken of how important it is that the government should prosecute those who have been involved in political violence or guilty of other human rights abuses; he has also stressed the importance of the courts determining the outcome of any challenge to the election results.
It is very important that the government should respect their decisions.
These are both enormously important points and touch, of course, centrally on the credibility of the whole democratic process.
Zimbabwe is plainly at a crossroads.
The outcome of the legislative elections could mark a major transformation in the country's political culture, the transition to a multiparty system in which Parliament will replace the ruling party Zanu PF politburo as the main policy-making institution.
President Mugabe's electoral strategy, focused on land reform and support for the war veterans, failed to address the country's economic plight and this was obviously reflected in the votes polled by his party.
The new government of Zimbabwe and all those who want to see the country rise above its present serious difficulties, whether they relate to the economic situation, the question of land reform or the terrible scourge of HIV, must now address the challenges effectively, collectively and constructively.
We have considerable influence as a major donor.
This influence has to be used to encourage the government to take positive steps for re-establishing the rule of law and good governance as a first step towards a more general recovery, and I know this is a point which my colleague, Commissioner Nielson will want to speak about after me.
But, once again, I would like to offer my personal congratulations to the honourable Member on a very difficult job, extremely well done.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten
You have already indicated that owing to the problematic nature of the issue, two Commissioners are going to give their opinion on it today.
I am therefore looking forward to hearing Commissioner Nielson' s opinion.
Mr President, I would like to start by echoing the congratulations to the EU electoral observation mission.
They have managed to do excellent work under very difficult conditions.
The result of these elections offers the EU a new opportunity for reviewing our cooperation with Zimbabwe.
According to the report by the heads of mission there is scope for positive development in Zimbabwe in the political, economic and social fields.
Options for the EU to assist in such development should not be excluded, as they say.
Zanu-PF will have to develop new and more appropriate policies in order to approach the international community for finance to stabilise the economy and restore growth, but the legitimacy of Zanu-PF is at stake because of the extent to which intimidation and electoral malpractice helped it gain victory and because, even discounting the impact of such factors, the MDC won 58 seats, almost as many as Zanu, with 61+1.
The Movement for Democratic Change will not want to share responsibility for the crisis the country is undergoing or for the painful measures which will be necessary for economic recovery.
Zimbabwe's EUR 110 million 8th EDF national indicative programme has a direct poverty alleviation orientation.
Its main sectors of cooperation are agriculture, health and education.
The Commission's approach so far has been that aid directed to the protection of basic social services and the reinforcement of civil society should be maintained even during periods of crisis.
A total of EUR 19 million is about to be released for a micro-projects programme which in the interests of consensual policies has been delayed until after the elections.
It can thus now go ahead.
The Commission has maintained its support for land reform through this micro-projects programme, which is actually for poverty alleviation assistance for legally acquired land in resettlement schemes.
However, in April the Commission froze the EUR 2 million for technical and policy support for land reform.
Until the government's land reform policy was clarified, there seemed little point in continuing a technical and quite academic discussion on the principles of land reform.
Hopefully this will change.
The Commission and other donors are ready to support the process, provided it is in the framework of legality, transparency and poverty alleviation objectives, in accordance with the 1998 donor land conference agreements.
The Commission is preparing a cross-sectoral programme to deal with the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Zimbabwe, which is in itself a development crisis and a major cause of present and future poverty.
This programme is to be financed from the EUR 33 million in the 8th EDF second tranche.
I will take a decision on this in the next few months depending on developments in Zimbabwe.
In any event the European Commission is continuing to support poverty alleviation schemes.
If the government seizes the opportunity offered by these new elections, EU support could be more substantial in the future.
As noted by the heads of mission in Harare, it is premature to jump to conclusions on the election and its consequences.
I fully share the view that EU-Zimbabwe development cooperation will depend on real progress in the fields of democratisation, rule of law, human rights and economic reform.
Finally I would like to stress that there is potential for increased cooperation with Zimbabwe, but this will clearly depend on how the situation develops there.
Mr President and Commissioners, I am speaking English not out of distaste for two languages that I like very much - French and Swedish - but because it was the working language of the mission.
Thank you very much for your kind words.
It is my pleasure to give the first presentation of the final report of the EU Election Observation Mission to Zimbabwe here in the European Parliament, an institution that has taught me so much and been such a joy to work in.
"These were not perfect elections," said the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai drily.
Indeed, in the view of our 190 election observers with experience of seven observation missions as an average, the pre-election period was one of the worst they had ever been in, while the actual election days, the polling, voting and count were among the best they had been.
What should one make out of such a schizophrenic picture, where, on one hand politically-motivated violence and intimidation cost more than 30 people their lives, with many more being threatened, persecuted, injured, raped and tortured, and, on the other, where the voters turned out nevertheless in record numbers, giving the opposition party almost half of the votes?
All along in our mission I refused to use the term "free and fair elections", because it is not applicable.
It is too blunt an instrument, in such a complex process as the one we witnessed in Zimbabwe.
Our mission had, therefore from the beginning stressed that we were not only there for the election process, but that our final report would also attach great attention to the post-election phase.
In this phase, the role and responsibility of President Mugabe, whose mandate lasts another two years, is crucial.
I underlined this in a conversation with him as well as in my public statements in Zimbabwe, saying that after revolution comes nation-building, after elections reconciliation.
Our hope was that, in spite of the extensive violence and intimidation campaign for which the ruling Zanu-PF had by far the greatest responsibility, the people, aided by a large international and national monitoring presence, could cast their votes in a relatively free, fair and non-violent environment on election day.
Thereby the period after the elections would be essential, and so would the role of the president and the Zanu leaders, and they would hopefully contribute to a climate of reconciliation and calm.
To a certain extent our strategy proved to be right.
People did vote in great numbers.
Violence and intimidation did not seem to scare them off from the polling stations.
Many also openly showed their sympathies for the opposition parties.
It is not that we were partisan, we had our code of conduct of professionalism and strict neutrality, but we did want the people to feel that their vote was secret, that on election day the President and the peasant are equal, and that democratic elections are the power of the people.
There was much violence and terror in the run-up to the elections and we condemn it.
But I would also like to stress that there was much more non-violence in the form of the millions of people who wanted to exercise the democratic right to vote.
The main opposition party, while challenging the results in 20 constituencies, has also accepted the results of the elections.
I believe that the people of Zimbabwe, who cry out for peace and law and order, progress and a decent life, deserve a better deal.
Allow me now to summarise our conclusions and recommendations in four points:
It is imperative that the government moves swiftly to re-establish the rule of law and to allow the police and prosecution services to act against those who have been involved in or encouraged political violence or other human rights abuses.
A new independent election organisation above partisan interest, and with sufficient human and financial resources to operate effectively is needed.
The government must also allow the courts to determine the outcome of any challenge to election results in particular constituencies, and must respect their decisions.
The European Union should endeavour to ensure that international observers are deployed in good time for the presidential election scheduled to take place in 2002.
The European Union should make a particular effort during the coming weeks and months to monitor events in Zimbabwe closely and provide assistance and support where appropriate.
I am glad to hear that both the presidency and the Commission also take this line.
For that purpose, our central election unit in Harare will remain for some time, as well as 25 EU observers deployed through the country.
Add to that our 14 heads of mission who will be on red alert.
Let me use this opportunity to pay tribute to the Election Unit, to the EU observers including friends from Norway and Kenya who were integrated into our mission, as well as five Members of the European Parliament.
The Commission, of course, responded in a swift and commendable way to the decision of the Council, and the continuous cooperation and dialogue throughout the process has been invaluable.
Let me end by saying that the EU mission was a high-profile one, very well received among the people in general to a point that would be the envy of several Member States, including mine, Mr Patten.
The mission can also be seen as an efficient conflict-prevention exercise.
It was quickly on the spot, in great numbers spreading calm and peace; it was operational in no time, with a good national coverage and with a sustainable strategy also for the post-conflict phase.
Our mission was an act of commitment to the people in Africa and to democracy worldwide.
I see the mission to Zimbabwe as a natural consequence of our support for the struggle for African independence and of our wish to build a strong partnership with a peaceful and democratic Zimbabwe.
Thank you very much Mr Schori, also for the fact that together with your five colleagues, you left Zimbabwe with a good impression of the European Parliament in Zimbabwe, under difficult circumstances.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since February Zimbabwe' s political landscape has been characterised by the illegal occupation of farms, flouting of court judgements, intimidation and violence towards opposition parties, their candidates and supporters, and at least an attempt at restricting the work of national and international election observers.
We also know who bears the main responsibility for these acts of violence: it is the leadership of the ruling party Zanu-PF.
I will be more specific.
It is President Mugabe who has authorised the occupation of farms, frustrated efforts to enforce court judgements, and defended the lack of respect for law and order, sometimes against the advice of his own Ministers.
It is clear to me that this insight exposes a dilemma, namely that the person who is the main cause of the problem must also take responsibility, at least for a certain amount of time, for part of the solution to the problem, particularly in view of the need for national reconciliation.
Because the things we experienced and heard reports of at first hand, were shattering.
Not only did we hear that in some parts of the country, opposition candidates were unable to enter their constituency for fear of risking life and limb, we also learnt that large sections of the rural population were being systematically terrorised in villages or on commercial farms.
In addition, the government used its monopoly of TV and radio shamelessly to convey its own view of things.
The opposition press only reached the urban population.
Elections that take place under such conditions cannot be described as free and fair.
All the more reason why I should regret the fact that several African observers evidently reached the opposite conclusion.
In so doing, they did democracy, but above all, the people of Africa, a disservice.
All those who have campaigned for their democratic rights, despite the adverse circumstances, deserve respect and recognition, particularly the national observers and the many thousands of electoral assistants who managed the practicalities of the election process with great fastidiousness and commitment.
I would like to make particular mention of the professional manner in which Pierre Schori led our committed team acting on behalf of the Council, i.e. the EU observer mission.
Unerringly, and following precise analysis, he reached a verdict that we as EP observers wholeheartedly embrace.
The presence of the EU observers clearly reduced the scale of violence and intimidation.
I would like to express my deepest thanks and appreciation.
Pierre Schori and his team have rendered outstanding service to democracy in Zimbabwe.
Now the elections have taken place we want to see some changes.
Tension is obviously rising in the rural areas, partly because the President has failed to issue a statement clarifying matters, and this situation gives cause for concern.
More farms have been occupied since the elections.
There are reports on individual acts of violence towards opposition sympathisers.
The Archbishop of Bulawayo has received death threats.
We demand the punishment of all those guilty of criminal acts against their fellow citizens, an end to lawlessness when the necessary land reform is being carried out, and respect for court judgements on the occupation of farms.
The aim of land reform must be to benefit those who are truly needy.
It is still important for us to engage in dialogue with the government, the opposition and the socially relevant forces, so that in future, Zimbabwe is able to make a contribution towards stability in southern Africa.
The elections in Zimbabwe have been both a victory and a defeat for Mugabe.
They were a defeat in the sense that, for the first time in its short independent life, Zimbabwe has a multi-party political system, which was something that Mugabe clearly opposed.
Apart from tolerating, and even, as we know, promoting, a climate of intimidation and violence, Mugabe has made considerable errors of judgement.
On the one hand, he has underestimated the European Union' s seriousness, willingness and capacity to act in the case of Zimbabwe.
However, he has also confused the factors within his own country.
I wonder if this is due to the arrogance of a former, although once respected, African freedom fighter, or to his ignorance of the sociological and political evolution of his country.
It is probably a combination of both things.
Mugabe has brought to these elections the customs and methods of a war of liberation, on occasion treating political rivals as if they were colonial occupiers who needed to be banished.
However, he was unable to appreciate that the emergence of the middle classes was an element which was going to have a different effect for the first time on these elections.
This relative consolidation of a new urban vote, together with the manipulation of official democracy and the violation of human rights, would not otherwise have led to many citizens voting against him, and that is what they have done.
The country and the population will gain as a whole if the current government and the emerging opposition show sufficient political wisdom and common sense to generously and cautiously deal with the transition from former political customs to other new ones.
In this area, the opposition also has a role to play.
Now, after all the accusations and condemnations, in the coming weeks we must watch carefully for any signs of verifiable reconciliation and self-critical acceptance of the errors made.
Mr President, this will help the future of Zimbabwe, its society and the new political culture born of these elections.
We must give decisive support to its future.
Mr President, the fact that the EU observer mission has garnered great international acclaim reflects the fact that Mr Schori has done an excellent job in raising the profile of what we were doing there.
I pay great tribute to him.
There is no doubt in Zimbabwe that it has been a case of "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely".
Mr Mugabe has much to answer for.
If the result may be said to have a positive side, it is the fact that there is now no longer absolute power.
Much of the violence that took place before the elections can be based directly back to the leadership of Zanu-PF and to President Mugabe himself.
The so-called war veterans - they must have been very young when the war of independence was on - have been paid to be on these farms.
This is a grave problem which be traced directly back to the leadership.
There were problems too with the fact that the postal votes, which were sent directly to the army in the Congo on Thursday, miraculously returned on Saturday, all in due form going into many marginal constituencies.
Threats of violence against supporters of the MDC have continued after the elections.
The Archbishop of Bulawayo has been threatened.
All these things must be stopped.
We cannot possibly support a regime that carries on this intimidation.
The fact that President Mugabe wants to stifle inward investment by nationalising the farms, and threatening to do the same with the mines, will do nothing to resolve the economic situation in Zimbabwe.
What Zimbabwe needs is much more inward investment from outside the country.
This will not take place under the present regime.
There is a great and wonderful opportunity in Zimbabwe now with the emergence of the MDC, for all races to work together.
There is great hope for the future, but we must make sure that we keep up the pressure on Zimbabwe and especially on Mr Mugabe.
We should take direct action against assets that President Mugabe owns outside of Zimbabwe.
We must take the argument directly to the man who has created the problems.
Mr President, my speaking time is too restricted to describe the fate of a country for which, for so many years, the situation was in fact quite hopeful, but which for the past couple of years has been on a slippery slope towards greater underdevelopment, whilst the population of Zimbabwe is highly developed.
This is probably one of the things we should give the Mugabe government credit for during its early years.
The population is knowledgeable despite the fact that the opposition was prevented from taking part in the election propaganda in a normal way, at least as far as the official media is concerned.
I know Zimbabwe quite well.
For quite a few years running, I visited the country and followed the situation from close by, but I was surprised at the extent of intimidation prior to the elections and I fear that this may continue, even after the elections.
Accordingly, I think we should act within the remit of our international responsibility and ensure that we continue to exert the same benevolent influence after the elections that we had in the run-up to them.
We can do this by driving a hard bargain, yet remaining specific, regarding the planned reforms in Zimbabwe.
A reign of terror pervades the countryside, and this cannot be allowed to continue, of course, because this affects the quality of life of the white and black population alike.
I would like to underline this because these people are also being sucked into a maelstrom of events which are beyond their control.
I hope that we will be able to keep the dialogue going with the government, the opposition and the civil society.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the lack of speaking time available to me I would not wish to repeat anything that has already been said.
I can only lend wholehearted support to what the previous speakers and Mrs Maij-Weggen have had to say.
However I would like to add to the debt of gratitude we owe Mr Schori a word of thanks to the embassies of our Member States, who assisted us in the accreditation process, because we were faced with a rather chaotic situation at the time.
We have them to thank for the fact that we were able to take action over there.
If there is one thing that should be emphasised when forming an assessment of the situation in Zimbabwe it is that the farm occupations have nothing to do with the land or race issues.
It is no more than a despicable means of holding onto power.
That is not without its tragic side because President Mugabe and his party definitely rendered outstanding service to the land once.
The terror perpetrated by the so-called war veterans is intended to divert attention from the shortcomings of the political leadership of the country, which has pitched Zimbabwe into a deep crisis.
The country has been brought to the brink of ruin, tourism is at a standstill, investors have pulled out, and to make matters worse, there is an oil crisis and a lack of foreign exchange.
Tobacco production and tourism used to be the main sources of revenue and both these sectors have taken a real knock.
This cannot be made good overnight.
This is where support from the European Union comes in.
All in all, Zimbabwe has the right conditions in place for this, in that the population is educated to a comparatively high standard, the jurisdiction is incorruptible, and the infrastructure is relatively sound.
But we are already hearing about fresh occupations of farms and violent attacks.
President Mugabe must be left in no doubt as to the fact that the violence and terror must be stopped, but it will take more than that to restore peace to this country.
The political opposition will have to prove that it is politically viable.
The fact that it was possible for observers to be present meant that in the end, despite the terror, the opposition was able to express its opinion freely on voting day.
That being the case, the opposition now has a job to do which it must see through.
We must help to see that the rule of law is restored in this way.
Mr President, the political pressure that preceded the elections and the flagrant manner in which President Mugabe encouraged the violence means that we are not talking now about free and proper elections, although we were sincerely convinced on polling day itself that we were witnessing a desire to hold an irreproachable election.
Everything spoke of a genuine desire on the part of the people of Zimbabwe to build a democratic civil society.
The events of Zimbabwe compel us, however, to consider the relationship between democracy and values, and this may be the right forum for that, as we refer to the EU as a society of values.
At the same time we openly admit that the EU cannot dash about the world paternally handing out advice to others from on high.
It is a matter of dialogue.
That was what Pierre Schori, as leader of the EU delegation of election observers, also demonstrated admirably.
Something happened in Zimbabwe that should make every politician consider how we can prevent the demoralising effects of power - among ourselves also.
Why does a former hero of a nation, the father figure of a struggle for independence, now allow the use of violence simply to underpin his own authority?
And what has happened to a person' s soul and sense of morality when he has the audacity to proclaim during the elections that the government will be staying in power, no matter what the result?
The philosopher and theologian, Niebuhr, once said that a person' s sense of what is right makes democracy possible, but his inclinations in the opposite direction make democracy absolutely necessary.
In other words: a person' s virtue makes democracy possible; on the other hand, his vices make it necessary.
I think this is one of the truest remarks ever made about democracy.
It follows that, in order to flourish, democracy needs its internal structures to be looked at critically and, indeed, has to be prepared to submit to criticism.
That means that we are willing, in the name of democracy, to encourage people to take a critical stand as citizens.
On the other hand, it requires transparency in decision making and the flow of information.
Only in this way can democracy preserve its self-remedying nature.
In Zimbabwe I also realised very clearly that we cannot speak of human rights without the recognition of human dignity.
It is just empty talk unless it is committed to the unique value and integrity of the individual.
At the same time, I would like to pay my respects to those thirty or more victims of violence who were to die whilst expressing their desire to struggle in favour of a free civil society.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, these elections certainly mark an important moment in Zimbabwe' s national political life.
They also augur extremely well for the European Union' s future cooperation with that country.
There are many things that now seem possible or, in any event, easier, between us.
The report drawn up by the mission led by Mr Schori, the thoroughness of whose work I must emphasis once again, as did Commissioners Patten and Nielsen, provides us with a perfectly clear and impartial analysis of the way in which Zimbabwe' s legislative elections were held.
The electoral situation was particularly tense, not to say violent.
I am convinced that the Union was right, profoundly right, to send this mission, a long time in advance, in order to bring an element of calm to this campaign.
The benefit of this mission in this regard, as in many others, is undeniable.
The mission must continue its work on the ground, as Mr Schori requested.
The Council Presidency is delighted at the generally smooth running of these elections, even if, here and there, the voting conditions might have left us rather perplexed and the mission' s conclusions on this matter are extremely enlightening.
It is now time to forge ahead in conjunction with Zimbabwe.
The Council Presidency fully supports the Commission' s analysis of the need to cooperate with Zimbabwe.
Numerous areas in which we can work have opened up, and they deserve our full involvement.
Amongst these are the strengthening of democracy, poverty reduction, and the fight against Aids.
It is crucial that European aid has a direct bearing on the economic and social problems that are besetting the people of Zimbabwe.
Community funds must now be released, as Commissioner Nielsen suggested.
For its part, the Government of Zimbabwe must also move forward and fulfil its commitments to land reform, to respect for court judgements and to economic transparency.
I am convinced that this process needs to ensure the stabilisation of the country and also its democratic involvement in regional integration.
This is why the Council Presidency, and you can be sure of this, ladies and gentlemen, will commit itself to achieving this aim with the same determination as the European Parliament and the Commission.
Thank you very much, Minister
I would like to inform you that pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for resolutions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Trafficking in human beings
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on trafficking in human beings.
Minister Queyranne will deliver the statement on behalf of the Council and in fact he has just arrived, punctual to the second.
Minister, you are in the fortunate position of being able to start your speech immediately.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council of Ministers has been deeply shocked by the events at Dover and the deaths of 58 Chinese nationals in tragic circumstances.
These events demonstrate the increasing pressure that migration is putting on Western Europe, which we have been aware of for some time.
In order to respond to a situation which is of great concern to our continent, European solidarity must be considerably strengthened.
Firstly, the point must be made quite forcefully that the existence of organised criminal networks, as well as the scale of professional smuggling, which is contemptible but lucrative, plays a central role in illegal immigration, both in increasing the flows themselves and in the methods for smuggling people, of which the tragedy at Dover is an extreme example.
We know that most illegal immigration arrives in Western Europe, as a result of smugglers, particularly in the case of those people coming from far-off destinations such as China.
This point must be emphasised in order to respond to those who say that it is immigration control that creates illegal immigrants.
The increase in non-lawful immigration, on the contrary, leads to greater activity by gangs providing illegal entry to our countries.
It is quite clear that this activity benefits from legislative or operational weaknesses in the destination countries and from all factors that allow the illegal immigrants to enter and remain in these countries in violation of their laws.
That is not all, however.
Behind the smugglers, we are beginning to see mafias operating to an ever-greater extent.
Police Chiefs have identified a Russian mafia, exploiting Sri Lankans and Chinese, and a Turkish mafia is taking charge of Kurds, Afghans and Iranians.
We also know that illegal immigrants from the Balkans are under the protection of Albanian mafias.
The fact that many of these illegal immigrants are concentrated in Calais, a bridging post for the United Kingdom - more than 10 000 have been arrested since August 1999 - shows the extremely active nature of the smugglers: 400 of them have been arrested since August 1999.
We should also no longer hide the fact that illegal immigration has become the subject of a veritable traffic in human beings, which consequently leads to crime, even to major organised crime.
Since it is easier, more lucrative and less risky than other forms of trafficking, such as drug trafficking, for example, trafficking in illegal immigrants is becoming a major issue in police and judicial action and cooperation.
The trade in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation is one of the most odious aspects of this trafficking.
When there is this level of organisation, it is no longer simply a question of combating illegal immigration, but of properly fighting crime itself.
The real culprits are those who organise illegal immigration, in whose hands those people hoping to emigrate are merely the playthings of a script that could easily become a tragedy.
We must therefore combat these smugglers first of all.
Non-lawful immigration or the trafficking in human beings is a new form of slavery that cannot be tolerated in our democratic societies.
We know, for example, that in order to use the services of a smuggler, it costs a Chinese national between EUR 10 000 and EUR 20 000 and years of illegal work to repay this debt.
They generally live under constant threat, without rights or any protection, often in horrific conditions.
The rhetoric of calling for a massive opening up of immigration for work or for the automatic right of residence for all immigrants only feeds this dream of Europe and helps to push hundreds of thousands of people every year into the clutches of criminal networks working in illegal immigration.
The European Union must therefore not make the mistake of targeting the wrong people.
It does not intend to do so and will concentrate on those who organise this traffic in human beings, which is one of the most cowardly and odious forms of trafficking.
The Council is determined to implement all necessary measures to combat this odious trafficking.
European cooperation must be based on the means available to the Member States, and the States have clearly decided to provide themselves with the means to fight this scourge effectively.
Since 1995, France has had a central office for the prevention of illegal immigration and employment, which has greatly enhanced its action in breaking up criminal networks in the last two years.
This body has succeeded in breaking up and halting the activities of around fifteen criminal networks per year.
Given the reality of the trade in human beings and of the traffic in illegal immigration, the French Presidency wishes to promote European cooperation, based on the conclusions of the Tampere Summit and on the following principles: co-development, the integration of foreigners, the fight against illegal immigration and the common policy on Asia.
The first point involves taking account of the situation in the countries of origin.
How can we deter people from wanting to leave their country for Europe under any circumstances and thereby often putting their fate in the hands of slavery networks?
The Council must base its action on the guidelines adopted at Tampere and I quote: "The European Union needs a comprehensive approach to migration addressing political, human rights and development issues in countries and regions of origin and transit" .
Migratory movements are actually due to numerous factors: demographic differences between the North and the South, the continual increase in inequalities of income and wealth between the richest and poorest countries, the instability of certain political situations and the often false image that immigrants have of what a future in Europe might hold for them.
Illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings are not inevitable, however.
They can be combated by means of a firm political will.
In a world that is undergoing profound upheaval, the task of controlling long-term flows must shift from politics to co-development and the stabilisation of the countries in which immigration originates.
The whole purpose of co-development is to link up these countries' policies for development in order to exercise control over migration flows.
France will strive to provide new impetus to this progress towards co-development, making use of its experience in this area.
An agreement has already been signed with Senegal and others are being negotiated with Mali and Morocco.
There are two questions to be answered: how can we encourage the development of local projects, specifically through aid for training and the resettlement of foreigners who wish to return to their mother country in order to contribute to its economic development, and how can this local development contribute to controlling migration flows by stabilising the population?
The study being carried out on these two issues will benefit the future work of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration, which is today striving to implement the specific measures established in five action plans, covering Morocco and Sri Lanka.
Implementing this priority led to a seminar being held on 6 and 7 July in Paris, in which experts and several Ministers will take part.
The purpose of this seminar is to draw up the text which will guide the work of the European Union, on the basis of a few pilot experiments carried out with countries that have cooperated in this area and which have stable state structures.
I am thinking here of Morocco.
The European Union' s second main priority, which was established at Tampere, is to integrate foreign nationals who are legally entitled to be in our countries.
This is an important point with regard to the fight against trafficking in human beings, which feeds off the fact that some foreign nationals in the European Union are on the margins of, or excluded from, society.
This integration requires a firm policy to provide equal economic and social rights and an equally staunch fight against any form of discrimination, particularly in the field of employment.
The French Presidency is planning to hold a seminar in October on this theme, with a view to presenting the Council with a draft text on the harmonisation of permits for extended periods of residence, which is an essential mechanism for integration.
The opportunity to adopt the nationality of Member States is also a fundamental aspect of integrating foreign nationals in Europe, but we realise that, in this area, each country applies its own laws.
The third point emphasised at Tampere is the fight against the criminal networks that I mentioned just now, and against the traffic in human beings.
This aspect is clearly one of the French Presidency' s central concerns.
The Tampere Council specifically stressed this priority, and I quote: "The European Council stresses the need for more efficient management of migration flows at all their stages.
It calls for the development, in close co-operation with countries of origin and transit, of information campaigns on the actual possibilities for legal immigration, and for the prevention of all forms of trafficking in human beings.
The European Council calls for closer co-operation and mutual technical assistance between the Member States' border control services" .
Following the events in Dover, the Feira European Council called once again for rapid action by the European Union.
This Council, and I quote, "condemned the criminal acts of those who profit from such traffic in human beings and committed the European Union to intensified cooperation to defeat such cross-border crime, which has caused so many other deaths across Europe" .
The Council has urged the forthcoming French Presidency and the Commission to ensure that the Tampere conclusions on this subject are implemented as a matter of urgency.
The French Presidency has already proposed four initiatives to the Council.
The first of these is a draft directive establishing sanctions against transporters who give lifts to illegal passengers.
This draft text would extend the measures provided for in the convention applying the Schengen agreement and the purpose of the text is to provide the Union with a common mechanism for sanctions.
This restates the obligation on transporters to do everything they can to ensure that the passengers they are carrying have travel documents and, if appropriate, the necessary visas.
This mechanism also restates the transporter' s obligation to send back or to accept responsibility for sending back foreign nationals who have not been allowed to enter for the reasons I have just mentioned.
This draft directive also provides for sanctions against those who have transported passengers who do not have the necessary documents or visas.
The proposed text provides for a minimum fine of EUR 2000.
A second draft framework decision seeks to increase the criminal punishment for aiding the illegal entry or stay in a country.
On this issue too, by extending the measures of the convention applying the Schengen agreement, covering the obligation of States that are signatories to the convention to provide for sanctions against anyone aiding an illegal entry or stay, France has presented a draft framework decision whose purpose is to encourage the harmonisation of national legislations with regard to defining offences.
This text will therefore play an important role in more effectively curbing the traffic in human beings.
The French Presidency' s third initiative was to also submit a draft directive on cooperation in the matter of expulsions.
The purpose of this draft directive is to facilitate the implementation of an expulsion measure passed by one Member State against a foreign national who is not legally entitled to stay, when this measure is taken by any other State, the foreign national having been arrested in their territory.
Fourthly and finally, an improvement in European cooperation in the area of controlling migration flows and increasing control over external borders is one of the Council of Ministers' priorities.
In its capacity as holder of the Presidency, France has submitted new proposals in this field, specifically an action plan, which the European institutions are about to discuss.
First of all, it is crucial to increase police cooperation in the exchange of information on illegal migration flows and on criminal networks.
The centralisation, cross-checking, analysis and use of this data must be carried out by the existing Working Group.
As the Feira conclusions emphasise, it is particularly important to develop Europol' s role in curbing the traffic in human beings.
The French Presidency therefore intends immediately to ask Europol to submit a report on the action it has undertaken in this area.
The other aim in the field of police cooperation is to strengthen the rapid warning mechanism, which must be made sufficiently effective to enable Member States to be informed about and to react in good time to events connected with illegal immigration.
This mechanism specifically involves the designation of points of contact between Member countries and entrusts the Council Presidency with the task of organising the necessary agreement for implementing the appropriate measures.
Increasing this coordination also involves establishing a network of liaison officers from the Member States in the countries where the immigration originates, in order to improve understanding of particular situations, to control immigration at source, particularly through the checking of travel documents at the point of embarkation at airports.
This whole range of projects, designed to strengthen the fight against illegal immigration, will be the subject of a seminar on criminal networks, which is to be held in Paris on 20 and 21 July, in other words, in a few days' time.
This seminar will bring together high level representatives of the Member States, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the United States, Australia, Canada and Mexico.
Several Ministers from the Member States as well as the heads of various immigration services and border police from Member States will be taking part in this symposium.
I should also like to emphasise the fact that one of the fundamental points resulting from Tampere is the principle of harmonising the right of asylum between Member States.
This is another important tool in the fight against illegal immigration.
We have seen requests for asylum increase dramatically in most countries in the European Union.
This increase reflects the higher number of illegal entries, since 80% to 90% of requests for asylum are rejected by the countries to which they are made.
The right to asylum is frequently used by criminal networks as a legal tool to make the entry into a country and the stay there easier for illegal immigrants.
The main difficulty in our task is therefore the need to reconcile this fundamental right to asylum, which is recognised in international conventions, with the fight against fraud.
With regard to this matter too, I shall refer to the Tampere Summit, where the European Council restated the importance attached by the Union and its Member States to fully respecting the right to asylum.
The Summit conclusions state that "this system should include, in the short term, a clear and workable determination of the State responsible for the examination of an asylum application, common standards for a fair and efficient asylum procedure, and common minimum conditions of reception of asylum seekers" .
It is therefore crucial first of all that we make progress with projects that seek to improve the functioning of the Dublin Convention, with regard to determining the State responsible for the examination of an asylum application.
France is paying close attention to the work currently being undertaken by the Commission.
We will have taken an important step forward if we are able to ensure that the State that is the original point of entry for a foreign national into the European Union has sole responsibility for examining that person' s application for asylum.
The Eurodac system, which will soon be up and running, enabling the fingerprints of asylum seekers to be stored centrally, will certainly contribute to the fight against fraud involving multiple applications.
We must also rapidly attain the objective of a fair and efficient asylum system in Europe.
There is therefore an urgent need to harmonise the conditions of reception for asylum seekers, in order to limit internal flows into European Union territory and thereby achieve a more balanced division between Member States.
This is why the French Presidency has submitted a draft set of guidelines, which is designed to make the Commission' s work and the drawing up of a future directive easier.
We hope to reach our first conclusions at next December' s Council, so that we can contribute to the preparation of the Commission' s draft directive, which is planned for the beginning of 2001.
The Council is therefore determined to use all necessary means to fight against the traffic in human beings and to do so in accordance with the Tampere and Feira conclusions.
The Council takes the view that the issue of the ways and means of illegal entry is no longer a question solely related to the problem of immigration.
This issue also involves the fight against organised crime.
This is the approach that must inform our work, and the French Presidency hopes to mobilise all necessary means - national, Community and intergovernmental - to succeed.
Mr President, first of all, I wish to emphasise that the Commission shares the sense of grief caused by the tragedy at Dover, which President Prodi expressed at the Feira Council and as I myself have expressed on behalf of the Commission.
We feel that these events are a particularly tragic illustration of the need for a common policy on immigration.
The Commission is pleased at the request made at Feira by the Heads of State and Government to speed up the process, and is firmly committed to play its part in this process, in conjunction with the French Government.
The Commission wishes to reiterate the fact that the framework for such a policy was established by the Tampere European Council and that precise deadlines have been set for implementing it, both by the Treaty of Amsterdam and the European Council itself.
If such a policy is to have a lasting effect, it must form part of the overall approach defined at Tampere, which requires both a more efficient management of migration flows and the development of partnerships with the countries of origin and transit, the establishment of a common asylum system and the guarantee of fair treatment for nationals of third countries who are legally resident in Member States' territory.
It is within this overall framework that efforts must be made to overcome the particularly odious types of crime that are the traffic in and exploitation of human beings.
These crimes are what lie behind the Dover tragedy, as well as all the anonymous tragedies that are played out every day, which we do not hear about since they are not reported in the press.
Unfortunately, however, they do exist.
More specifically, the Commission wishes to point out that a very short deadline has been set for the Council to adopt the necessary legislative measures to be able to prosecute and punish the behaviour of those who profit from trafficking in human beings.
A deadline, which runs up to the end of this year, has been set for the formal adoption of the legislative instruments that will enable the main players in this kind of trafficking to be punished.
The Commission wishes to confirm its desire to cooperate with the Council to ensure that this deadline is scrupulously observed and notes the fact that the French Presidency is about to present its first initiative, which is a framework decision designed to strengthen the fight against aiding illegal entry and residence.
We welcome this response by the French Presidency and we shall study the text closely to see to what extent it covers the objectives that the Commission had set for itself under its own proposal.
There are two aspects in particular to which we should pay attention in this context: employers' responsibility and the consequences of employing workers illegally.
This does not only involve monitoring the European Union' s points of entry, but also monitoring what is happening within our Member States, particularly with regard to the illegal labour market.
Furthermore, the traffic in human beings in particular must be curbed, since it involves trafficking in women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, which is a specific feature of the traffic in human beings in general.
The Commission wishes to point out that the protection of victims and the respect for their rights must remain a constant concern of this presidency, as some victims pay with their lives and others are forced into slavery
In this respect, the Commission plans to submit a proposal on providing short-term residence permits to victims who agree to cooperate with the police and judicial authorities in fighting the criminal networks that traffic in human beings.
Victims' testimony is in fact crucial to the police and judicial investigations being able to produce effective results.
If we expect victims to provide this testimony, we must guarantee them a minimum of personal security.
The Commission also urges Member States to increase their cooperation with Interpol, so that this body is able to make full use of all its resources in the fight against organised crime in this area.
In this respect, we wish to emphasise the importance of the conference to be held by the French Presidency on 20 and 21 July in Paris, which the Minister has just mentioned.
We also need to develop and strengthen the Schengen acquis as included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Priority must be given to researching the means for ensuring the proper implementation of existing laws on granting visas and controlling external borders by using the surveillance and monitoring mechanisms that are available for this purpose.
A review must also be carried out of existing measures, and, should they be required, the necessary legislative amendments could be introduced to the Schengen acquis.
All means should be investigated in order to facilitate administrative cooperation, following the example of the Odysseus programme, a third of whose projects that have been retained for 2000 are already contributing to the fight against illegal immigration.
Furthermore, the Commission shares the desire of the French Presidency to see the procedures for placing responsibility on transporters reviewed and adapted as a matter of priority and has noted the Presidency' s announcement of an initiative to this effect.
In our opinion, this initiative should form part of the development of the Schengen acquis and should deal appropriately with the various means that could be used in close collaboration with the operators because, without this cooperation, it will be difficult to fight effectively against the trafficking in human beings.
Within the framework of cooperation with countries and regions of origin and transit in general, particular attention must be paid both to combating poverty and to respect for human rights.
More specific action could be also be undertaken with regard to developing awareness-raising campaigns on the real possibilities of legal immigration and on all forms of trafficking, as well as increasing the ability of the authorities in the countries of origin or transit to effectively combat this type of crime themselves.
We should consider the option of increasing the appropriations that have been earmarked for this purpose in the preliminary draft budget for 2001.
In addition to this, forms of closer cooperation could be considered for applicant countries, particularly in the areas of training, equipment, and the exchange of information on criminal networks.
With this in mind, we feel that it is important to develop cooperation agreements between Europol and the police forces in applicant countries as quickly as possible.
The conclusion and the effective implementation of Community agreements on readmission will also contribute to diminishing the attraction of the offers made by traffickers, who claim to be able to provide their victims with guaranteed access to the destination country.
In more general terms, we must review repatriation policies as a whole, including the issue of assistance for voluntary return, so as to guarantee coordination and efficiency whilst respecting the rights of the people involved.
It is imperative that we make rapid progress in establishing a common European asylum system, based on absolute respect for human rights and on the principle of non-refoulement, which seeks to provide the appropriate status for any person in need of protection, through the use of fair and efficient procedures.
The proposals that the Commission has already submitted concerning the European Refugee Fund and temporary protection, as well as the launch of the process of revising the Dublin Convention, should be swiftly followed up by other initiatives on the procedures and conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers.
The Commission is in the process of evaluating the report by the European Parliament on its communication on a common procedure in order to present, before the end of this year, a legislative initiative on a common procedure for asylum in Europe.
By the same token, we welcome the French initiative to submit a set of guidelines on the conditions for the reception of asylum-seekers.
As was said at Tampere, the whole purpose of the exercise is to achieve, in the medium term, a common definition of refugee status and, to complement this, other subsidiary forms of protection.
The Commission feels that any lasting solution will require a genuine immigration policy to be gradually established.
This policy must take account of the Union' s views on social, economic and demographic developments, and will consequently guarantee the admission of migrants under an organised and clear framework, as well as their harmonious integration into the communities that receive them.
The Commission is preparing a communication on this subject for the autumn, as well as legislative proposals, which follow on from those covering permission for the families of foreign nationals working within the Union to join them.
Those proposals are currently under consideration by the Council, and the new proposals should define the conditions and the methods for admission, particularly for purposes of work and study.
We all recognise the importance of this debate and this exchange of views has clearly been influenced by the emotions caused by the Dover tragedy.
It is tempting to say that the solution lies in increasing repressive measures and, as you see, I am not rejecting the idea of doing so.
What we must understand above all, however, is that, in the medium term, it is by producing a proactive immigration policy at European level, backed by clear criteria, which are shared by all Member States, that we will guarantee victory in this battle.
This must be a balanced policy, both in its measures on "the integration of emigrants" and in its measures on "effectively combating networks of organised crime which exploit the victims of the traffic in human beings" We must never lose sight of the balanced approach provided by the two aspects of the European common policy on this issue.
Mr President, it is a tragedy that it has taken the deaths of another 58 people to get the problem of trafficking firmly on the international, political agenda.
The Dover disaster has once again opened our eyes to the unscrupulous practices of traffickers in human beings and to the powerlessness - or should that be unwillingness? - on the part of the European Union to stamp out this disgraceful type of exploitation.
Trafficking in human beings has grown into a bigger business than trafficking in drugs, according to The Economist last week.
Organised crime has discovered that this business is not only more profitable, there is less risk involved too.
Every year, about half a million people are smuggled into the European Union.
In the port of Dover alone, hundreds of illegal aliens are arrested on a daily basis.
As the trafficking in human beings increases, so does the economic and sexual exploitation of these people.
Traffickers demand astronomical amounts to smuggle their customers to the West.
Upon arrival, their documents are often seized, as a result of which they are completely at the mercy of crime syndicates.
Young girls are frequently raped during the journey and end up in prostitution or the illegal labour market later on.
It is not unusual for victims who are unable to pay their debts to meet with terror and violence.
It is clear that traffickers in human beings are becoming more professional in their activities.
Their infrastructure, communication and control facilities outstrip those available to the police or courts in the countries of origin or transit.
This internationalisation of organised crime is in stark contrast to the inability of the EU Member States to adopt a coordinated approach in dealing with the trafficking in human beings.
Everyone is agreed that the problem transcends the control, reception and repatriation capacities of the individual countries and that we need to join forces.
But despite the best of intentions, European cooperation is leaving a great deal to be desired.
We do not seem to manage, once the police and courts are involved, to rise above the nationalistic knee-jerk reaction.
And organised crime is exploiting that situation.
Enlargement of the European Union would merely aggravate the problem.
The new countries are, due to their location, extremely vulnerable to the trafficking in human beings.
What is more, their police and court systems are even less adequate than those of the current Member States.
In our resolution, we at least call for the application of the principle of solidarity and make a few very specific proposals for far-reaching cooperation in the fight against the trafficking in human beings.
If we want to prevent tragedies such as those at Dover from happening again, extending the Third Pillar should not be delayed any further, and we are hopeful after President Chirac' s address and Minister Queyranne' s speech.
Mr President, I would also like to begin my intervention by saying that my sentiments about the Dover catastrophe are deeply felt.
Unfortunately they are nothing new.
I live in an area of Europe where, every day, every week, the dead bodies of emigrants from the north and south of Africa appear.
These victims do not appear in the news because, fortunately, they are yet to die on a massive scale, but rather they die in a trickle.
Having said this, I am sure, as Commissioner Vitorino has said, that the European Union needs a common policy in order to manage the legal entry of immigrants - bearing in mind our economic, social and demographic situation - in a reasonable way, preventing arbitrary treatment and, above all, turning to legal immigration avenues instead of traffickers in human beings.
I believe that we have the responsibility to establish a legal framework which will allow this to be done.
We also have the responsibility - and I would like to highlight this - to apply laws which already exist in the whole of the European Union and which regulate our labour market.
It is outrageous that some people import and use labour and then go unpunished.
To this end, there is no need to create new immigration laws, but we simply have to use the ones we already have to regulate the labour market and punish employers of illegal workers.
A year ago in October, the Tampere agreements were adopted.
I hope that the Commission will do everything that the Commissioner has said and that the Council is up to the job.
In that case they will have the support of this Parliament.
Mr President, sadly, there will be many more Dovers.
Not so long ago, we talked about the trafficking in human beings at the Strait of Gibraltar, and this was also referred to a moment ago.
Prior to that, we held a debate regarding a ship transporting Kurds which ran aground off the Italian South coast.
Each time, the authorities panicked, as is the case again now.
It is high time we adopted policy.
Because that is what it comes down to: each time a policy is announced, but this time, we need to do something about it, because we know that the trafficking in human beings simply continues.
So what should we do?
Minister Queyranne and Commissioner Vitorino already mentioned it.
We need to tackle the causes.
We need to set up common immigration and asylum policy, fight cross-border crime and at long last establish surveillance of the EU' s external borders.
But I would like to point out something else.
The heads of government themselves, under the leadership of President Chirac, who were here this morning, could chip in straight away.
When they meet in Nice, they could abolish the right of veto in European justice policy.
In this way, they, and later on the Council of Ministers for Justice, can at long last lay down European immigration legislation by enhanced majority, something which this Parliament has been calling for for many years.
In the case of crime policy, fighting the trafficking in human beings should not be the remit of Europol alone.
It is necessary to harmonise the penalisation of this crime at European level.
Indeed, the trafficking in human beings is a prime example of cross-border crime, which is what makes prosecution so difficult.
This is why it is necessary to set up a European Public Prosecutor' s department in this field.
Mr President, there has been enough talk.
It is time for action!
Mr President, I would join my voice to those who have talked about the tragedy of Dover and the young lives cut short there, but I also want to add my revulsion at the attitude of many people: well, what do you expect, if you take these risks you have got to expect that you might die.
It is a cruel and judgmental attitude that has appeared in much of the press and it does not help us find a solution.
If governments are serious about combating trafficking, these are three areas they need to think about.
How can people legally enter the countries of the European Union, especially those coming from third countries which experience poverty or oppression?
Secondly, how can we gain the confidence of those who could provide evidence against trafficking organisations.
I welcome what we have heard about that this afternoon.
Thirdly, how the current policies of the European Union and its Member States help to create refugees.
We should not be concentrating so much on a deterrent policy at our borders.
We need to look at how we are contributing to the incentive to leave.
We need to examine the consequences of our policies on, for example, trade, its rules and terms and who we will trade with, the conduct of companies based in the European Union and their operations in other countries such as Nigeria, the arms sales by Member States to repressive regimes.
If we are looking at real co-development, that will be a major step forward and I welcome that.
I think we should be considering how our open market closed-border policies are assisting the market forces driving the increases in human trafficking.
Mr President, 58 Chinese immigrants who arrived at Dover, in the hope of a better life, have died in horrific conditions, surrounded by crates of tomatoes.
I, like all of you, am deeply shocked.
This crime, however, is a daily occurrence at European Union borders.
Let us not forget Yagine and Fodé, the two boys from Guinea, who wanted to see Brussels last summer.
Since the beginning of this year alone, dozens of young people from the Maghreb have drowned trying to reach the Spanish coast.
Fourteen Kurds died of asphyxiation in the hold of a burning ship in Patras.
Dozens of Albanians and Tunisians die en route to Italy.
These are terrifying figures.
They should be unacceptable in a European Union that prides itself on being based on the protection of human rights.
How then, can we put an end to this?
That is the question.
The debate that has opened as a result of the Dover tragedy has focused on the traffic in human beings and the eradication of the mafias that organise the criminal networks.
The trade in smuggling human beings is undeniably flourishing.
For a long time, we have known about the existence of criminal networks, such as the Chinese Triads, who make huge profits by transporting desperate people to countries that they are led to believe are paradises.
Mafia networks must therefore be harshly punished, but so must the people who exploit illegal labour, since no immigration networks exist without economic networks.
As a result, in France, Chinese illegal immigrants are forced to work for years in sweat-shops to pay for their journey.
These modern-day slaves supply a cheap labour force to whole sectors of the economy, and bosses are therefore free to move them around, even within the European Union.
The dogma of liberal globalisation has magnified the free movement of goods and capital, but is seeking to stop the free movement of people.
Emigration, whether it is a result of political oppression or poverty, merely reflects global inequalities.
It is a symptom of the ever-widening gulf that separates North and South, and the incentive to emigrate is all the stronger since images of Western prosperity are invading the screens of the third world.
It is true that the free movement established by the European Union is a fundamental right, but this is reserved for its own nationals.
Nationals of third countries have seen their movement littered with traps, as a result of the Schengen agreement and the mirage of zero immigration.
All of these factors have simply created new forms of illegal immigration.
A purely repressive European response to the issue of immigration would certainly consolidate Europe' s fortification mechanism, but this would be ignoring the most fundamental aspect, which is the uniting of efforts and sharing at global level.
A seminar is certainly a good idea, Minister, but it should cover a common immigration policy based on the principle of freedom of movement, improving rights...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the horrific death of 58 Chinese illegal immigrants, discovered by British customs officers at Dover, highlights, above all, the scale of the pressure that migration is exerting on the countries of Europe.
These people came from China, after all, in other words, from the other side of the world, from a country that has nothing to do with Europe and for which we can certainly not serve as an outlet for resolving their problems of poverty.
In a case which is so typical, the best possible response we can provide is to combat illegal immigration and particularly the mafia-type organisations behind this new form of trafficking in human beings.
We are rather shocked to hear the words of Commissioner Vitorino, who, on 20 June, on the subject of the Dover tragedy, said that this, amongst other events, was proof of the need for a genuine policy on admission and integration, which makes a definitive break with the fantasy of zero immigration.
Those who mention the fantasy of zero immigration unfortunately too often do so in an attempt to provide an advance justification for a lenient policy.
We do not wish to fall into this trap.
On the contrary, we are calling, as a matter of priority, for a halt to this immigration, not only through a policy of co-development and of fighting the mafias, but also through strengthening control at the Union' s external borders and the reintroduction of controls at its internal borders, which have been so carelessly destroyed by European decisions over recent years.
Where internal borders are concerned, of course, we will probably not reintroduce fixed controls in the traditional form.
We must aim for a more flexible network, organised around jointly run border posts, near to borders.
In any event, however, controls will be needed, otherwise we will face the gradual collapse of our societies' structures, which, if the truth be told, match the aims of globalisation too well not to suit Europe' s enemies to a tee.
Mr President, less than 5% of lorries that arrive or pass through the port of Dover are stopped, and even less than that 5% are searched.
So what is to be done?
Is it not obvious that we must step up the controls, section more policemen and carry out 20 times the amount of controls in order to be able to guarantee that controls are being carried out properly?
And the responses from the Council have not changed; they are still the same: Europol, Eurodac, police cooperation.
On behalf of the Council, Minister, you informed us that the immigration policy and the fight against crimes related to illegal immigration are two separate issues.
This cannot possibly be true, it is not true and I would argue that even the Members' speeches illustrate that it is not true.
Parliament is ready to vote on a joint text - and I urge it to do so - a text which defines the direct relationship between restrictions on immigration and the way organised crime benefits from this trafficking, for this connection lies in the prohibition mechanism.
Where there is no legal immigration integration policy, when it takes months to obtain work permits, when United Nations reports tell us that our societies, our countries in Europe need a regular influx of hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year, immigrants which are not permitted to enter, not only in the highly-skilled new technology industries but also in the manual labour industries, restaurants and services, when we are under the illusion that we are banning everything and preventing all harm, we find ourselves overtaken by a flood of illegal immigration which is only illegal because it has, in actual fact, been banned by these laws.
Minister, I believe that Parliament may be able to take a stance on this matter which opposes what you have said today.
Mr President, we have a problem: we are not moving with events.
We are here today for the 58 victims of Dover.
Like Mrs Terrón, I am also from a country, Spain, in which we unfortunately witness hundreds of deaths and disappearances in the Straits of Gibraltar and the Andalusian coasts.
There are outbreaks of violence and xenophobia all over Europe and, while here we are talking about a new globalised economic society and a new information society, we do not realise that organised crime, trafficking in human beings, sexual exploitation and drug-trafficking have also become globalised.
All of this is interconnected.
That is to say, we are talking about a new form of criminality and human slavery which reminds us of the pre-abolitionist era in the United States.
Chinese, Moroccans, Russians and South Americans are transported, extorted and advised by mafias.
This is the responsibility of some very important international organisations and there is a desperate need for international cooperation to combat one of the most shameful violations of human rights; international cooperation of European police forces and judges with police and judges in the countries where the migrants come from, who also have responsibility for the problem.
If they do not have administrative, judicial or police structures, we will have to cooperate with them so that they may be provided with them.
In this regard, the Action Plans which were mentioned by the representative of the Council may have an important role to play and I hope we can debate them in Parliament more transparently than we have up to now.
We must go beyond words - as he has also said - because words do not solve the problem.
We must give the necessary resources to Europol, so that it can work effectively, and to the Action Plans, so that they can be carried out, to the refugee fund and to our borders, so that they can carry out the corresponding controls, because, unfortunately, without economic resources, nothing can be achieved.
Anything else is mere verbiage and preaching.
Mr President, the tragedy at Dover was one of the most appalling incidents that anyone here can recall.
A tragedy for the people involved, a tragedy for their family and friends, but also a tragedy for Europe and the European ideal.
As a European Parliament, we must do everything we can to prevent a recurrence.
This appalling incident was avoidable.
Mr Cappato spoke a few moments ago about the controls at Dover.
But the authorities in Zeebrugge knew that the lorry in question was suspect.
They had never heard of the company on the side of the lorry and the driver paid cash for the ferry.
Accordingly, they alerted the port authorities at Dover.
Had they checked the vehicle in Belgium some of these lives could certainly have been saved.
I thank the Minister for his genuine and honest statement.
He spoke about the real culprits, the organizers.
And of course he is right that we must fight organized crime and global trafficking, but identifying the culprits is only part of the battle.
We must do more to support the countries from which these people came and improve the conditions there.
Can we here in Strasbourg even begin to contemplate the misery and desperation that drove those Chinese people to spend months travelling in clandestine fashion halfway across the world?
And their prospects?
Probably to work in Chinese restaurants satisfying Westerners' desire for Chinese food.
But to do this they died a tragic and desperate death because as Europeans we failed to come up with common and workable procedures for asylum and immigration and that must be on all our consciences.
Mr President, the human tragedy and the facts of these cases are well known and, as Mrs Boudjenah quite rightly pointed out, they were well known long before the Dover tragedy.
The political will has been made clear, indicating that it is time to pass a legislative act for identifying, arresting and punishing the culprits.
Minister, Commissioner, you have truly disappointed me.
You are not even following the line taken at the Tampere Council.
The Tampere conclusions make a clear call for the Commission to submit a report on the implementation of the conclusions of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration for the consideration of the European Council in December 2000.
This means that, in six months, you will have to draw up a report on what you have achieved.
Listening to your speech, I have the feeling that I have been invited not to a Parliamentary sitting, but to a rather posh get-together.
I had hoped that the Commission would go further, that it would have the courage, for once, to submit proposals, and that it would be able to do what the Council of Ministers is asking it to.
Minister, the French Presidency may be content to make the point at the next summit, without any real desire to study the Commission' s report or to tell us whether the Commission is fulfilling its contract with regard to Eurodac.
If, however, the French Presidency is not able to establish a concrete schedule for legislative procedures to be implemented at European level and to be transposed to Member State level, we will once again face failure, which will lead to another debate like today' s, following further deaths.
Everyone will complain and Europe will not have made any progress.
What I am really asking for is for the Commission to show that it is up to the task, and, in line with what President Chirac and Mr Queyranne said, for it to feel sufficiently chastised so that the work requested of it is sufficiently detailed for the politicians, Ministers and the Council finally to be able to take some decisions.
Mr President, I would say that although emotions are running high everywhere here, trafficking has claimed 2,000 casualties over the past five years.
What I do see, however, is that the OSCE, the IOM, the Council of Europe, the Commission and Parliament are all coming up with sound proposals.
We talk and talk, draft and produce texts and can be very low, very pessimistic, but it is the first time that we are talking at global level and that something is being done to solve the problem.
I am always a little hopeful, yet realistic on two counts.
Realistic in the sense that practice and theory are two different things.
For example, when we repatriate people, for example when we send illegal Poles from Germany back to Poland, you need to realise that, some of them have train tickets, obtained from their illegal employer, to return to Germany, within two hours of their arrival, because that is where they work, where they have their jobs and where they are able to earn money.
Secondly, we should not overlook the role of the victims.
This entails reception and a document entitling them to walk around freely.
And the Chinese must be able to speak out.
I have experienced this first hand.
Chinese girls, and women, in particular, are more communicative than men, because I have the impression that women are less fearful when it comes to this kind of thing.
I know of Chinese girls whose faces have been slashed with knives.
They are scarred for life.
If they return, if they are repatriated to their countries of origin, the scars will still be visible.
They cannot go back.
You need to realise that we need to be able to repatriate people of their own free will, but I do not believe in this free will.
I think that for certain people, the situation is more complex than that.
There are some who are very hopeful and want to go back, but you need to think of the role of the victims.
In Great Britain, for example, in Dover, in the UK in general, there are no shelters for victims of trafficking in human beings.
There is not even any sound legislation concerning this issue.
Accordingly, Europe is responsible for its own legislation, for what we can do ourselves.
And we can do this, we are in this fortunate position, unlike countries in the Balkans, the Ukraine, Lithuania, all these countries which are lacking money and resources, where the NGOs are embroiled in a lopsided power struggle.
I would like to finish off with a comment on the police forces.
I call on you to provide them with the necessary resources for they are fighting a one-sided war.
Mr President, there have been deaths which weigh like heavy stones on our hearts and our consciences, deaths which call for a European reception policy, a policy of rights and duties for migrants, a policy which says: in Europe, nobody is a foreigner and nobody is illegal.
Since 1993, 2063 victims - men, women and children - have died in the struggle to be allowed to live: the earth' s rejects, suffocating in containers, drowning in our seas and committing suicide in detention centres.
The responsibility lies with the traffickers who now form an international network, and the Union will be forced to employ every means and exploit all possible cooperation between countries in order to break these criminal networks; the responsibility lies with a policy which meets the needs of migrant communities with closed borders; an emergency and security policy which induces fear of invasion.
Yet immigration from regions near and far is part and parcel of the history of Europe.
We will overcome illegal trafficking when we tackle the causes of the gap between rich and poor countries, when we practise a policy of cooperation and development which allows everyone to live as a citizen of the world.
Mr President, not only is it shocking that events of the kind that happened in Dover should occur in the first place, what is all the more shocking is that we only become aware of such happenings at all when they are on a certain scale.
Tragic events of this kind happen to hundreds of people at borders, day after day.
What you do not see, however, is any action on our part.
We have been discussing the matter here for months and trying to outline a whole range of possibilities, but if you will forgive me for saying so, there is still no package of measures that will actually remedy the situation.
Indeed I am delighted whenever the Council Presidency comes up with fresh proposals, and a great many proposals have also been produced on this occasion which are to be welcomed.
However, it would be desirable if these proposals were to dovetail with each other.
There have been a whole host of individual measures where the second measure has often been put in place before the first, instead of the other way around.
What we need to do is to harmonise and coordinate these measures more effectively.
Hence my call for these measures to at last be put into effect.
I would like to briefly mention some very important points such as cooperation with the countries of origin, the implementation of the action plan, the need to at last put the agreements in place, criminal punishment for traffickers, i.e. the need to make EUROPOL stronger than it used to be, the need to draw up Community legislation governing immigration, and likewise asylum and the fight against abuse.
Permit me to ask one question in this connection: we always discuss EURODAC at the beginning of a Presidency and we always hear that EURODAC will soon become a reality.
We are now some years further down the line and there is still no sign of EURODAC.
I would be delighted if you could actually manage to get EURODAC up and running.
My question to you, Minister, is this: will you make it happen, and will you follow Parliament' s advice and leave the authority for implementation with the Commission, or are we to continue having discussions that head off in the wrong direction?
Permit me just to add a second question.
You have mentioned a seminar due to take place on 20 and 21 July, and this is to be welcomed with open arms.
Are the parliamentarians invited to this as well, following the commendable example set by Portugal, when we were able to attend these conferences with representatives?
Also, in view of Mr Jospin' s comments, permit me, as an Austrian, to ask whether Austrians will be invited to this conference.
Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for their words and to add my voice to the many who have expressed their shock and horror at this tragic loss of life discovered in Dover.
The committee which I have the honour to chair has repeatedly made clear its view that we need a European immigration policy.
This tragedy involving those so desperate to reach our shores - and it is of course no isolated incident - throws into sharp relief the lack of an immigration policy.
We know that the numbers trying to come to our continent are not in fact increasing over time.
It is simply that as the legal avenues have closed, so the private sector has moved in to exploit the illegal avenues.
Last year's summit in Tampere gave a mandate to the Commission to start moving towards a common policy and I understand from my meeting last week with Mr Chevenement, President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, that the French presidency will launch initiatives to deal with the persons involved, to deal with the transporters of these victims.
The European Parliament looks forward to being consulted on these initiatives.
But these are not enough.
How long will it take for governments to realize that they have no clothes in this matter?
How long will it take for them to realize that the criminals are so far ahead of them, and to develop the methods of police cooperation which will put an end to this vile trafficking?
I am even tempted to suggest that they might use things like the Echelon system to start fighting against these traffickers, but that might be rather provocative in view of the vote coming up on Thursday.
The fact is that we should be proud that we have developed a society which is so attractive that people wish to come and join us, but we should perhaps also be rather ashamed that our development aid policy has not been more successful in reducing the push factors in some of the countries of origin.
Until we succeed - and I recognise the work of the high-level working groups - in reducing these push factors, we ought perhaps to open our doors a little.
It might even be in our own interest, rejuvenating an ageing population and enriching our own culture.
I am pleased to hear that Canada is among the countries invited to the presidency's seminar.
We might be advised to take a leaf out of Canada's book.
The Liberal Government's proposals there are to close the backdoor to illegal immigration but at the same time open the front door to a legal migration policy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this debate has enabled us to see that there is a broad consensus on the Tampere Summit guidelines, and in particular, on the three elements, the first of which consists of our relations with the countries of origin.
This element also comprises actions for co-development, which we must improve, since immigration is a result of inequality and of the desire of people without jobs or prospects to come to richer countries.
The second element is the provision of legal residence for foreign nationals and, from this point of view, I do not think that a policy of zero immigration is right for Europe.
I think that this would be unrealistic.
We must allow foreign nationals who live in our countries to live free from discrimination, and to become integrated.
The third and last element consists of combating illegal immigration, and particularly criminal networks.
I share the opinion of many of today' s speakers, such as Mr Cappato, for example, when they say that these criminal networks are part of organised crime.
We must therefore stand up to these international organisations, these powerful mafias, which deliberately try to take advantage of loopholes in the law, problems in cooperation and the extremely high demand in the countries concerned.
Under our Presidency, we have the opportunity to build on the proposals presented in this debate.
I am thinking in particular of the proposal by Commissioner Vitorino on readmission agreements with the countries of origin, such as China, for example, with regard to making the trafficking in human beings for purposes of sexual exploitation a specific crime.
I also think that we must work together on specific proposals, such as the timetable for their implementation that you requested, including the regulation implementing Eurodac, which must be completed by the end of the year, in response to Mr Pirker' s question.
Above all, we must use this presidency to clarify guidelines, particularly those on Europe' s long-term immigration policy.
We have planned an informal Council meeting, a Justice and Home Affairs Council, for the end of this month, in Marseilles, and, to that end, we have tabled this issue on the agenda.
Moreover, the Chairman of your Committee, Mr Watson, is also due to take part in this debate at the end of the month.
I should like to point out that honourable Members of this Parliament are invited to attend the various conferences that will be held within this framework.
Mr President, I am convinced, at the end of this debate, that there are only two fronts on which we can combat illegal immigration and in particular the types of exploitation it involves.
This exploitation has been universally condemned following the Dover tragedy, as well as other incidents in the Straits of Gibraltar and on the coasts of several of our countries.
Firstly, we can use the harmonisation of legislation and then closer cooperation.
Legislation must be harmonised because people should no longer be able to play on the present differences in laws on asylum and on punishment between countries and consequently play the free movement card to try to evade European vigilance.
We also need closer cooperation because we are dealing here with powerful organisations, which must be confronted.
In my opinion, Europe' s role, through the work of the Council, the Commission, which can nurture these ideas, and Parliament, is to promote our concept of immigration, which is balanced and humane, and to guarantee that human rights are respected in spite of the rising tide of organised crime and trafficking in human beings.
First of all, I should like to state the Commission' s position on the Tampere programme.
I must emphasise the fact that, since Tampere, the Commission has already proposed a number of legislative instruments, so that they can be discussed by the Council and adopted within the deadlines that have been established by the scoreboard.
I am not only talking about the instrument for the regulation of Eurodac.
I am also talking about the proposal for a decision on the European Refugee Fund, the directive on temporary protection, the revision of the Dublin Convention, which determines which State is responsible for examining applications for asylum, and the results of the consultation on the definition of the common rules of procedure on asylum issues.
I think that we could even add the fact that, where legal immigration is concerned, the Commission has tabled a proposal for a directive allowing the families of foreign nationals working in the Union to join them.
We carried out these measures in the six months following Tampere, in compliance with the deadline adopted under the scoreboard that the Commission presented to the Council.
The Commission is not behind schedule, and although this is a complex debate, it is under way, both in Parliament and in the Council.
I therefore understand why Mr Ducarme should say that he feels disappointed.
We all feel disappointed and the reality of the situation is indeed disappointing, but I must tell you - and this point needs to be emphasised - that the Commission has tabled the proposals that were laid down within the deadlines that were set.
You said that my speech did not match the deadline that was set for the end of this year, so that the Nice European Council can evaluate the policy on asylum and immigration.
With regard to this point, I suggest that you look more closely at which deadlines we are in fact discussing.
Nice has the task of undertaking a preliminary evaluation of the work of the High Level Working Group on Asylum and Immigration.
These action plans have been drawn up by that Group and I must tell you that the Commission has more grounds for optimism today than it did three months ago, because we have managed to reach agreement with the Member States on measures for co-development that the Commission will have to implement under several Community policies, including those on human rights, economics and development aid.
The Commission and the Member States have also reached agreement on measures to be adopted by Member States, with the five action plan countries.
The deadline of December 2000 that I mentioned is another deadline altogether!
This deadline was not set for the Nice Council.
This is a deadline that was set at Tampere for the approval of a legislative instrument which establishes common definitions, common incriminations and common punishments for trafficking in human beings, and specifically for trafficking in women and children for purposes of sexual exploitation.
The Commission can reassure you on this point.
Both the French Presidency and Mr Queyranne have just said that the French Presidency has tabled a proposal for a legislative instrument, a framework decision for the incrimination of trafficking and smuggling.
The Commission itself is fully on time with this deadline and with presenting a framework decision for the prosecution of trafficking in human beings.
I therefore think that we are indeed putting forward initiatives and I am counting on the support both of the Council and Parliament to be able to conclude these legislative procedures within the deadlines that have been fixed.
I should simply like to make two additional comments: the first, which is directed at Mr Berthu, who, unfortunately, is no longer present, is that, when I was talking about the fantasy of zero immigration, I meant that sometimes, the argument of zero immigration is used as a rhetorical instrument.
It is also interesting to note that some leaders who use the argument of zero immigration in this way are also those who are largely responsible for immigration policies that are lax in terms of integrating immigrants into the societies that receive them.
When one condemns the fantasy or the rhetoric of zero immigration, one does so in order to suggest that there is an alternative, and the alternative is to have a proactive immigration policy, which puts at the top of the list of common concerns the integration of legal immigrants into the societies that receive them.
One condemns it in order to clarify the criteria and the principles of a coordinated immigration policy at European level.
That is the alternative and - I am sorry to say so - I do not share the idea that the alternative is to reintroduce internal border controls by means of jointly run police stations, which would not be on the border, but thirty kilometres away from the border.
Lastly, my second comment is to say that I am delighted at the fact that this debate has achieved a very broad consensus on the priority we must give to the fight against organised crime, and I shall make a wish.
My wish is that this consensus still exists when, at the right time, encouraged by the French Presidency and supported by the Commission, and within the deadlines fixed at Tampere, this Parliament is provided with the necessary instruments for combating money laundering.
I say this because to combat money laundering is to have an effective instrument with which to combat organised crime.
That is not rhetoric, because it is taking the fight to the very area in which the battle must be won.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received seven motions for resolutions.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, at 12 noon.
1998 discharge (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the 1998 discharge.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you will be aware, this morning' s joint debate on granting discharge to the Commission was not closed, since we still had to hear Commissioner Schreyer' s final speech.
The Commissioner is now present and I am therefore delighted to give her the floor, after which we can close the joint debate on the issue of granting discharge.
Commission.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank you for allowing me to take the floor once again, because the sitting was just finishing when President Chirac arrived, albeit belatedly, but at least the flight from Paris to Strasbourg came together in the end.
I would still like to answer some of the questions put to me during the debate.
Firstly, there was the issue of restructuring budgetary control and the question as to how this is to be achieved.
Again, on behalf of the Commission, I am able to tell you that in the first place, this will be done by setting up an internal audit service, which will be used to set up an independent and self-contained office.
Naturally we intend to maintain centralised ex-ante control during the transitional period, and in fact this will take place following a risk management exercise, i.e. following an assessment of all the risks facing the various areas.
Secondly, there were questions to do with demanding the return of funds: the Fléchard case to be precise.
Mrs Morgan asked me whether the Commission was still prepared to answer questions on this.
Of course the Commission is willing to do so and I am in fact confident, Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, that in this respect too, we will be able to find a way of completing the exchange of information in such a way that there are no disagreements or differences of opinion.
Another point raised concerned the search for the minutes of the meeting that took place in 1994.
To the person who asked the question, I would reiterate that OLAF is carrying out a fresh search for the minutes which has yet to be completed.
However the Commission - and I think this is important - has come to the conclusion that the entire archiving system needs to be overhauled.
Mrs Theato, you asked me what has become of the draft of the comprehensive legal framework, specifically for combating fraud, and not just for improving financial management.
In the past week, the Commission adopted a strategy paper on a comprehensive approach to combating fraud, which we are certain to be able to discuss in the Committee on Budgetary Control before long.
It proposes four courses of action, firstly that of comprehensive legislation to combat fraud, including fraud prevention, secondly extending cooperation with the Member States, the candidate states and third countries, then the third course of action would be interinstitutional cooperation for combating and preventing fraud in office.
Fourthly, there is the improvement of the criminal dimension, i.e. criminal prosecution.
On the subject of which, I am able to tell you that in all probability, the Commission will adopt a proposal for the Intergovernmental Conference before the end of this month recommending that the European Treaties be amended in such a way as to enable a European Public Prosecutor' s Office to be set up.
This is a demand that the Committee on Budgetary Control has just put to Parliament, the Commission and of course the Council.
We know that controversial discussions are taking place over this proposal in the Council and that it is failing to meet with a great deal of approval.
That being the case, we should give thought to whether, in the event of this proposal failing to be adopted, the convention, which has still not been ratified, should be incorporated in a different form of legislation, perhaps even a directive.
On behalf of the Commission, I would again like to thank you for this morning' s debate and also for the constructive criticism, and I would like to reassure you once again that the Commission will take steps - some of which it has already taken - to guarantee more effective implementation of the budget of the European Union.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday, at 12 noon.
LIFE
The next item is the report (A5-0172/2000) by Mrs Lienemann, on behalf of the Parliamentary Delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text adopted by the Conciliation Committee on the European Parliament and Council regulation (EC) concerning the financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (C5-0221/2000 - 1998/0336(COD)).
- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the LIFE III second reading debate held here back in February, we concluded that this regulation was better than the LIFE I and LIFE II regulations.
It was better because it was more rigorous, more transparent and more rational.
It was better because it established the promotion of employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting potential projects.
It was better because it established the reduction of the global impact of products, from manufacture to recycling and disposal, as one of the objectives that LIFE­Environment should achieve.
Lastly, it was better because it established the improvement and planning of coastal areas as one of LIFE­Environment' s priorities.
Despite these positive points, there remained four areas of disagreement between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and these were dealt with under the conciliation procedure.
These areas were the budget, comitology, provision for a fourth stage of LIFE and the objectives of LIFE­Environment.
The work under the conciliation procedure added further improvements to the LIFE III regulation and we can say quite simply that, although we lost on the issue of comitology, we managed to get our views across on the essential issues.
I therefore congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, both on her work at first and second reading and on her work during the conciliation procedure.
I would like to highlight what I think are the two most relevant points.
With regard to the budget for the period 2000-2004, which was the main issue at stake, we would clearly have preferred to agree on an amount closer to EUR 850 million - the sum proposed by the European Parliament - than the EUR 613 million set by the Commission and the Council.
Nevertheless, as they say, politics is the art of the possible, and if we had not agreed, as we finally did in conciliation, on an amount of EUR 640 million, we would have ended up bearing the political responsibility for leaving thousands of projects in limbo and without financial support for the year 2000.
In any event, we told the Commission and the Council once again that, as far as Parliament is concerned, although these appropriations are more than the common position provided for, they still fall short of the sum that LIFE has demonstrated it deserves.
I should also like to express my satisfaction with the agreement that has enabled us to integrate the sustainable management of water and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the objectives for LIFE­Environment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, they say that every era and every generation creates an image that defines its relationship with nature.
The concept of relationships with nature is changing radically in our own time.
In future we will not be able to subordinate this relationship to profit, selfishness and exploitation.
Whatever today' s policies may be, they must reflect this new philosophy of a relationship between mankind and society with the environment.
With this in mind, the European Union has pioneered legislation in the field of environmental protection and has also been a key partner in international negotiations and agreements on the global protection of the planet.
The transposition of European directives into national legislation has played and continues to play a crucial role in all our countries, particularly Portugal.
The LIFE programme is just one financial instrument at the service of the European Union' s environmental policies and of those of its neighbouring countries in the Baltic, the Mediterranean and in Eastern Europe.
This is not, however, the only financial instrument with repercussions for environmental policies.
We know, for example, that regional and agricultural policy, which is to a large extent harmful, has an enormous impact on the environment and on Europe' s land and water.
It is undeniably important for LIFE to be adopted.
Having experienced many vicissitudes and a period of paralysis with regard to the projects financed by this programme, the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament finally formalised an agreement specifically on a budgetary framework of EUR 640 million for the period 2000-2004.
LIFE III will therefore be operational before the summer.
The agreement that was finally reached has many good points, part of the credit for which must go to the Portuguese Presidency - which once again demonstrated its constructive and efficient relationship with the European Parliament as well as its ability to mediate.
Credit is also due to the European Parliament delegation and specifically to Mrs Lienemann.
I also wish to welcome the agreement reached by the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament on the framework directive on water, an instrument that is crucial for the European Union' s environmental policy.
Mr President, the European LIFE programme is the key European Union initiative to integrate environmental measures into the broad ambit of European Union policies.
The Union as a political entity has a moral and legal obligation to ensure that a clean environment is protected and promoted under Article 130 of the Maastricht Treaty.
In fact between1992 and 1992 the LIFE initiative cofinanced nearly 1600 projects with a total Community contribution of approximately EUR 2.1 billion.
I am especially satisfied that the European LIFE programme has promoted the use of cleaner technologies and has also financially supported many waste recycling programmes.
From an Irish perspective over 90% of our waste is still dealt with via landfill sites.
I would like to welcome initiatives taken by the Irish government, including diverting 50% of all household waste away from landfill sites, reducing by up to 65% biodegradable waste consigned to landfill, developing broader waste recovery facilities and reducing methane emissions by up to 80%.
I also welcome the fact that the Member States have allocated an increase of EUR 27 million for the new LIFE programme for the next five years and that the overall budgetary allocation made to the LIFE programme will be in the region of EUR 640 million.
Congratulations to the rapporteur.
Mr President, the European Union' s environmental policy never ceases to amaze me.
It would appear that the Structural Funds are set aside for countries in line with the environmental directives, which is a discriminatory measure par excellence.
On the other hand, we are legally able to add vegetable fats to chocolate, use GMOs, transport oil and its highly toxic waste products on any rusty old ship that is banned from entering the United States and lastly, pollute the Atlantic coast in complete impunity.
Spot the deliberate mistake.
The LIFE programme, with its EUR 640 million budgetary allocation, is far from being a model of transparency, leading us to question the proper use of public funds.
In February I proposed - in vain - that the funds used in land purchase should be set aside for public structures, as in our view, public money should not be used as private real estate capital, even under the guise of environmental protection.
The Commission also shares this view and in its clarification of the eligibility criteria regarding expenditure within the framework of the Structural Funds SEM 2000 stated that, 'the purchase of land is the responsibility of a public institution or an organisation that is subject to public law' .
I should like to know why the rules governing the Structural Funds are not applied to the LIFE funds.
I also put forward six other specific proposals that would be easy to implement, in order to limit local disputes and justify the proper use of public monies.
It is with regret that I note that not one of these proposals has been taken into account and the use of the LIFE funds remains as lacking in transparency as ever with poorly defined eligibility criteria, somewhat vague, uncoordinated operations, reports that remain unpublished, a lack of assessment policy, etc.
We shall therefore vote against this report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now on the home straight as far as the LIFE regulation is concerned.
The debate and procedure have certainly gone on for a very long time, but despite the criticisms raised here, the following proverb is true of the programme: a happy outcome is worth waiting for.
The original Commission proposal dates back to December 1998.
Notwithstanding the fact that there have already been two debates on the new LIFE regulation in this House, I would still like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of this programme as a programme for promoting environmental protection.
That said, it is far from being the only project for promoting environmental objectives that the EU finances.
In particular, I would point out the substantial sums of money available within the structural funds, the environmental objective being one of mainstreaming, i.e. applicability across the board.
I would also draw your attention to the money spent on promoting rural development, and to the expenditure on environmental research, protecting the tropical rain forest and promoting environmentally friendly energy.
But LIFE has special goals of its own.
It will be used to set up the Natura 2000 network - another measure that has your support - and it will promote the incorporation of environmental interests in land utilisation planning, as well as promote environmental projects in the Mediterranean and Baltic regions.
The programme extends over a number of years (2000 to 2004), and the financial allocation was increased from EUR 613 million to EUR 640 million under the conciliation procedure.
In the course of the conciliation negotiations there were also discussions about the committees that are supporting the Commission in the implementation of the programme, and on behalf of the Commission, I would draw your attention at this point to the fact that, in our view, the provisions of the corresponding Council decision were not applied correctly, which is why the Commission duly submitted a statement to this effect at the end of the procedure.
Fortunately though, common ground prevailed, and on behalf of the Commission, and specifically my colleague Mrs Wallström, I would like to extend warm thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, the Chairwoman Mrs Jackson, and, in particular, the rapporteur, and I would also like to take the opportunity, as Commissioner for the budget, to say that I would be only too pleased to debate and discuss the EU budget and environmental protection with the Committee on the Environment at some point.
I hope that it will very soon be possible to report back on the first positive projects under the new LIFE programme.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30.
2001 budget (conciliation procedure)
The next item is the report (A5-0184/2000) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2001 budget in view of the conciliation procedure before the Council's first reading.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having discussed and adopted our guidelines for Budget 2001 in the spring, we are now drafting and formulating the position we intend to take up in the conciliation procedure.
This procedure will begin with a trialogue on Thursday evening, followed by conciliation on the outcome of the trialogue in the traditional meeting of delegations at the time of the Council' s first reading.
This meeting is due to take place on 20 July.
The new interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and the improvement of the budgetary procedure, which was concluded on 6 May last, have revised our old ad hoc procedure.
Our current conciliation procedure has become the centrepiece of the procedure for interinstitutional cooperation in budgetary matters.
This procedure now encompasses two topics, firstly the one that was covered by our old ad hoc procedure, i.e. agricultural expenditure, including the expenditure resulting from fisheries agreements, along with the EU financed CSFP expenditure.
However we should also discuss all the other expenditure; at least discuss it, even if we cannot agree.
Because the conciliation procedure creates the framework that makes it possible, as it says in the interinstitutional agreement, to continue the debate on overall expenditure development and the essential features of the budget for the coming financial year in the light of Commission' s preliminary draft budget.
That is precisely the stage we are at now.
We are in possession of the Commission' s draft budget, and our motion will contain advice for the Council on its first reading of the budget.
This advice will be clear and unequivocal.
One of our main priorities was, is, and remains support for the peace and stability process in the Balkans.
We asked for a multiannual programme for this as early as last year, so that the financing for this process would no longer have a hand-to-mouth existence but would be placed on a firm footing.
We have already inserted a revision clause in the interinstitutional agreement to this end, in conjunction with the Council and the Commission.
In addition, as early as December last year, we drew up a joint declaration, together with the Council, during our last second reading.
Accordingly, the Commission has now presented a proposal for revision of the financial perspective and for a multiannual programme for the Western Balkans.
It has also submitted a preliminary draft budget based on the revision of the financial perspective.
We welcome this initiative from the Commission, because we believe that it is absolutely vital to revise the financial perspective if we are to honour the commitments entered into by the European Union in the Balkans.
However we do not think that we should finance our aid to Kosovo and the Balkans simply by carrying out a multiannual redeployment of our traditional priorities in external policy, and making cutbacks in our cooperation with developing countries and in the aid we deliver to the poorest of the poor.
By adopting Agenda 2000 we have already agreed to a 22% cut in heading 4, albeit only on condition that the appropriations needed for Kosovo and the Balkans are financed by fresh money.
Consequently, we are expecting the Council to enter into constructive negotiations with us to this end, and hope to reach a conclusion before the Council' s first reading.
Permit me to make a few comments on the traditional aspects of the ad hoc procedure.
We take the view that when it comes to heading 1a, i.e. agriculture, we are completely justified in waiting until the Commission has sent its Letter of Amendment before we amend the ceilings.
We are delighted that the Commission has budgetised in heading 1b the full amount available under the financial perspective, and we hope the Commission will be able to make full use of it.
Last year, Parliament fought tooth and nail for heading 1b.
We are not so fickle as to behave any differently this year.
But we certainly take a keen interest in the transformation of the nature of the appropriations for heading 1b into differentiated appropriations.
As far as the fisheries agreements are concerned, we are expecting that as in previous ad hoc procedures, the Commission will submit updated, realistic figures before Parliament' s first reading that we will then be able to take into account.
We think it is right and proper that the CFSP is becoming more and more of a Community policy, i.e. CFSP actions are being transferred from the Second Pillar to the First Pillar.
However, we would like to press home to the Council that this must not lead to more and more cuts in the amounts available for our traditional external policy measures
What we absolutely cannot agree to is the Council' s attempt to finance the Special Envoys in its own budget.
The gentlemen' s agreement only applies to administrative expenditure.
The expenditure for the special representative is of an operational nature.
If such a step was taken without the agreement of Parliament, then we would deem this a violation of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the part of the Council.
That was the advice I wanted to give the Council.
There will be more in the motion that we are due to vote on tomorrow.
We expect the Council to take account of our deliberations and decisions in those of its own.
Mr President, we find ourselves in a phase of the budget which resembles the lull before the storm.
The Commission has submitted a second preliminary draft on which the agricultural sector would certainly like to comment.
First of all, the European budget comes off worse compared to other major continents because there is less public funding available here compared to those other continents.
Secondly, the budget has not yet reached the prescribed ceiling.
I hope that the Council will make up the difference, if not, Parliament will be submitting proposals.
There are also a few other issues which have struck me.
We need to try to use the budget efficiently.
On the one hand, there is a reshuffle of the headings, also in this budget, which begs the question as to whether the relative stability or the European Union as a whole are safeguarded.
Does the budget tie in sufficiently with discussions with a social dimension within the European Union, such as those pertaining to consumer affairs, the environment and animal welfare?
The European Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is open to issues of this kind, also with regard to proposals which may or may not be submitted.
The same applies to the quality of policy, and in this connection, particular attention should be given to whether policy helps maintain a high-grade rural environment in Europe from a financial point of view.
Can Europe' s rural environment count on adequate care and financial means?
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development' s report and the opinion show that we welcome the deferment of the discussion regarding the EUR 300 million set aside for the reconstruction of the Balkans as far as it goes.
The discussion has been postponed until October, but the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has pulled no punches in this respect.
The second point I would like to make in this connection is that, since every year, we have some money left in the agricultural budget, it should be possible to use this money the year after i.e. to earmark it and not to return it.
Thirdly, particularly in respect of agricultural policy, resources must be used more effectively and more pressure should be exerted on the Member States or the Commission in order to speed up the submission of plans which can then be implemented adequately.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for an excellent report, and for having come to hear the views of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Our committee tabled two amendments for the report.
Owing to tight meeting timetables, they have been brought to the plenary session via my own group, and I hope that they may be adopted.
Amendment No 19 reminds everyone that there must be adequate payment appropriations for Structural Funds programmes, trans-European transport networks and other budget headings relating to transport, so that the programmes may be effectively implemented right at the start of the programming period.
In this way payments made at the end of the programming period - as was the case the previous year - are avoided.
Amendment No 20 concerns innovative measures.
The appropriation must be kept at the level decided at Berlin.
We have to remember that the Interinstitutional Agreement contains a pledge that the reduction in appropriations by EUR 200 million made the previous year should be made good this year.
Our committee is not proposing to move appropriations set aside under the URBAN initiative to be used for innovative measures: the compensating appropriations have to be found elsewhere.
The importance of innovation was stressed both at the Lisbon and Feira summits.
Innovation must therefore be adequately supported.
The implementation in practice of innovative measures in the area of Structural Funds has not got under way because preparatory work on the part of the Commission has lagged seriously behind.
Our committee supports the policy of support for employment and the importance of SMEs in Mrs Haug' s report.
The Commission and the Member States should also simplify and speed up administration procedures relating to Structural Funds.
More attention should be paid to the success of projects at approval stage.
Mr President, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are enthusiastic supporters of the common foreign and security policy, and we are also supporters of these Special Envoys which, at the moment, are inscribed in the Commission' s budget.
If I need to mention the Special Envoys at all, it is because the Council is insisting on transferring the financing of the Special Envoys to the Council' s administrative budget.
That may sound very sensible.
The problem, however, is that, in doing so, there is a loss of the inspection and the control that of course exists in the case of budget items in the Commission' s budget.
I therefore agree with what is stated in Mrs Haug' s report, namely that we must insist that these appropriations for Special Envoys remain on the Commission' s budget, for we in that way ensure continued parliamentary inspection and control and ensure that Parliament continues, for example, to be listened to and kept informed.
In the Foreign Affairs Committee, we have been sufficiently constructive, however, as to think also about how a medium-term solution might possibly be found in a situation where negotiations with the Council were taking place.
This can be read about in the Foreign Affairs Committee' s contribution to Mrs Haug' s report.
For if the Council definitely wants these appropriations to appear in the Council' s budget, there is, of course, the possibility of the Council' s, in return, entering into a type of inter-institutional agreement with ourselves here in Parliament, whereby the Council promises to give us the same information, control, inspection facilities etc as if the appropriations had appeared in the Commission' s budget.
That is, therefore, the Foreign Affairs Committee' s constructive contribution, and I should like to add that we, of course, also insist that, whenever anything new is adopted concerning the common foreign and security policy - be it in terms of expenditure or of initiatives - the Council must inform the European Parliament.
.
Mr President, I begin by endorsing the plaudits that have been offered to Mrs Haug.
She has indeed worked quite hard although, in the case of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I am afraid she was working so hard that she was not able to pay anything more than a goodwill visit to our committee.
Therefore we have prepared the opinion which is before Parliament.
I will briefly touch on some of the points that arise from it.
Firstly, I want to support the points that are made by Mrs Haug concerning the implications of spending in the Balkans.
It is a matter that has been of significant concern to the Industry Committee.
We are particularly concerned about the implications for a wide range of the programmes that fall within our remit.
It certainly is the case that, with the move to activity-based budgeting, we are moving away from the concept that everything that was previously in the budget has to be preserved for the future.
Nonetheless a great deal of the programmes that are within our remit would be significantly affected by the spending proposals for the Balkans, unless Mrs Haug is successful.
So on behalf of the Industry Committee I should like to voice our support for her in that regard.
In two particular areas we are affected by multiannual programmes.
I want to reiterate our commitment in the research area.
I recognise that this is not a matter that is affected by the budget on this occasion, but we should not ignore the changes we are seeing in the energy sphere with Save and Altener.
The figures that we see are seeing for Save, where there is a significant reduction in the budget for energy efficiency schemes, are a result of the budgetary process last year.
That is only just now coming through.
The final point I want to make in the trade sphere relates to the need for us to ensure that the omnibus regulation for the transatlantic dialogue is adapted.
I hope the Commissioner will take that on board.
Mr President, the Commission' s preliminary draft budget contains few surprises as far as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is concerned.
As rapporteur for this committee, I would just like to highlight three points that are of interest to the committee, within the context of the conciliation procedure.
One concerns the information campaign in the last phase before the introduction of the euro bank notes and coins.
The remaining time will have to be used intensively, which means that the information campaign for the euro (PRINCE 2001) must be continued with high priority.
We must step up the information campaign so as to avoid any uncertainty on the part of the public, particularly in the run-up to the introduction of the euro banknotes and in view of the exchange rate parity between the euro and the dollar.
The Lisbon guidelines constitute a second important point in the eyes of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
In addition to providing sufficient means and technologies for SME, it is also important to support programmes and actions that improve the self-financing and outside financing facilities for the Union' s key players on the job creation front.
This includes developing markets for financial services, providing risk capital, but also giving special attention to female entrepreneurship, as has already been called for by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in the guidelines.
My third point concerns the debate about personnel.
If the Commission wants to honour its Treaty obligations in respect of merger control, anti-trust law and state aids then my committee believes that the Commission should make the Directorate-General for Competition a top priority when it comes to the redistribution of personnel in this area.
Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, allow me to come straight to the points that are causing my committee the most concern.
It is almost as if the Commission has forgotten that we committed ourselves to establishing full employment again in the European Union, when we were in Lisbon, which is something President Chirac emphasised again before this House only this morning.
How else are we to explain the fact that of all the budget headings, it is the one for local commitment for employment that the Commission wants to completely do away with?
I am appalled by the idea, and have every right to be, given that only in April, the Commission issued a statement highlighting the importance of the local dimension to Europe' s employment strategy.
This budget heading was one of Parliament' s initiatives.
We wanted more money for employment and we wanted to gather more experience of similar projects over three years so as to be able to subsequently arrive at a legal basis.
Hence there are, of course, no possible circumstances under which we would endorse the Commission' s decision on this, simply because, as a Commission, you have run out of ideas at the moment for promoting innovative measures in the Social Fund.
We very much hope that the Council will side with Parliament in this matter, and that we will in fact be able to retain this employment initiative.
It is equally unacceptable and completely incomprehensible that the Commission wants to make drastic cutbacks of 32% and 18% respectively in the budget headings for the action plans against social exclusion and discrimination, even though social coherence in the European Union is precisely what we are always calling for, and only this morning we again had an extensive debate on the anti-discrimination package.
I believe the Commission knows full well that we have no intention of supporting this cutback, and here too we are relying on the joint discussions.
At any event, I hope to see some movement from the Council and the Commission with regard to the points I have mentioned.
The same goes for the non-governmental organisations and the budgetary line for health protection in the workplace.
Mr President, the Committee on Fisheries has been calling for the strengthening of the common fisheries policy on an international level as well.
We must support our fishing industry and help it to be placed on an equal level with giants such as the United States, Russia or Japan.
As draftsperson of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to express my satisfaction with the Committee on Budgets' support for our proposals on the international fishing organisations and agreements.
Firstly, I will refer to our contribution to the international organisations.
In an increasingly globalised world, the Union must increase its presence in these organisations which regulate offshore fishing, for reasons of prestige, good management of resources and, above all, the defence of the interests of our industry and our workers.
My second point concerns the international agreements.
This six-month period, with the French Presidency of the Council, will be decisive in terms of completing the negotiation of these agreements, including, amongst others, the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco.
We are all concerned about the prolonged inactivity - seven months now - of the Community fleet which was fishing in Moroccan waters.
This is by far the European Union' s most important agreement in this area and our main priority: five hundred boats, thousands of fishermen out of work and many economically paralysed areas depend on its renewal.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Haug on her work, which has not been easy, and I am happy that the amounts envisaged by the Commission for the funding of the agreements to be negotiated in 2000 and 2001, the agreement with Morocco amongst others, have been respected.
Meanwhile, Mrs Haug, your report is a clear sign of the European Parliament' s support for the Community' s negotiators and for the thousands of European families who are impatiently waiting for the negotiations to be concluded.
Mr President, first of all I would like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Budgets for their sound cooperation.
Secondly, the Committee on Development and Cooperation is extremely keen to radically expand its budget compared to last year, because we have 45 million children in Africa with no primary education and an increasing number of poor in the world, whilst our continent is becoming increasingly rich.
But we maintain a sense of realism.
We are prepared to make do with reducing spending to the 2000 level and thus cancel out the cut-backs which the Commission proposed in favour of financing Kosovo.
No more, no less.
We are aware of the broad support we enjoy in this Parliament.
Thirdly, the issue of modernising the budget is essential.
This morning, we talked about the 1998 discharge.
The way this discharge is currently organised leaves a great deal to be desired.
With our help, the Commission would like to change tack.
The new approach involves a clear definition of goals and sectors within regional programmes, explicit grouping of sector-specific goals and a clear division of budget lines.
We will, as a result, be able to deploy personnel where they are needed to carry out the activities.
This results in a classification according to DAC sectors.
It is a modernised budget and at the same time, it will inform us whether we have actually achieved the results projected in the budget, as will be apparent from the reports in Parliament.
This budget, therefore, also accommodates the EDF budget, although we are not harmonised legally but we are in terms of content.
The sum total will, as it were, show that we are clearly focussed on fighting poverty across different sectors.
We very much hope that with this line of attack, namely a modernised budget, we will be able to turn the negative image, about which Commissioner Patten had every right to complain so bitterly, into a positive image of a Europe which is open to fighting poverty at world level.
- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion on the 2001 budget is progressing.
We are gradually gaining an understanding of the positions being adopted by the Commission, particularly with regard to the preliminary draft budget, and the Council will soon state its position.
I believe that in the course of this complex process, whilst Parliament is working towards consensus on its views amongst Members so that it can advocate these views as vigorously as possible, it must demand complete clarification of the Commission' s proposals, as well as objectivity in the Council' s position.
Parliament must then move forward, as a whole, with its own position.
So we have reached a stage in the clarification process when "wait and see" stance is appropriate.
It seems pointless at this juncture to make threats, to proclaim Parliament' s power or to put forward all of our views at once.
Everyone realises, or will realise, the importance of the European Parliament in the budgetary process and how important it is to achieve consensus in this process.
In the meantime, we need to know more about certain fundamental issues, such as:
implementation of the 2000 budget, especially both parts 1-A and 1-B of heading 1, "Agriculture" ;
evaluating the reductions proposed by the Commission in internal policy sectors - heading 3 - particularly bearing in mind the justification for these reductions and their effects on the policies that have been targeted;
promoting an in-depth analysis of the proposals for reforming the Commission, including the staffing needs of the directorates-general and its policy on externalisation;
identifying the priorities of the Council and the Commission with regard to external actions - heading 4 - and clarifying the relationship between commitments and payments under this heading, by investigating the reasons for the worrying delay in the implementation of commitments and by ascertaining the quality of the expenditure;
gaining full information on what is being proposed in the new programme for the Western Balkans, including Serbia and Kosovo, particularly with regard to its financing;
information on how it is intended to finance the common security and defence policy.
As you will see just from these examples, what we need to know goes well beyond the discussion on financing the Western Balkans.
In fact, it would be a mistake for the European Parliament to reduce the discussion of the 2001 budget to this one issue.
I have two final observations.
Taking the appropriations for payment as a point of reference, in 2000 these totalled 1.11% of the gross national product of the Member States, but a lower amount is being proposed for 2001, corresponding to 1.0%.
Does it make sense to try to deepen the European project and at the same time to reduce the relative value of the European Union budget year on year?
And, bearing in mind the figures that I have just mentioned, does it make sense to discuss the financing of new priorities and to actually question some of the priorities already established, while at the same time returning considerable unutilised sums to the Member States?
I congratulate Mrs Haug on her fine work.
Mr President, all the points I have to make are addressed to the Council and even though there is no-one on the front bench I am sure the hardworking scribes will relay that information back to the Presidency and to all the Council delegations.
If you look at the Haug report, Parliament wants to find a solution.
We are actually looking for agreement with the Council on the way to get a good budget by the end of this year.
Let us get that point clear.
We are not looking for confrontation, we are actually looking for a way of cooperating together.
But do not be fooled into thinking that we are not prepared to take hard decisions if necessary.
It is pretty hard to get an agreement when the Council just ignores Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Ever since the PDB was published by the Commission they have been duty bound to discuss with us the revision of the Financial Perspective which was proposed by the Commission.
They have failed to do that.
On two occasions we have asked them for trialogues and we have been refused.
That makes it pretty difficult.
And that will be at the forefront of our discussions at the trialogue this week and in the conciliation on 20 July.
Whatever the Council votes on 20 July we will still be making that point in the autumn when it comes to our first reading.
From the very first trialogue of this year with the Portuguese Presidency, the one thing that was obvious to everyone is that we need an agreement between the three institutions on the funding for the western Balkans.
I am pretty sure Parliament has a position now.
The Council's position is about 200 million less than ours, which means that we will not get an agreement on that and unless we have an agreement there is going to be a problem in how we fund the needs in category 4.
It seems now that there might be some possibility of redeploying funds from the MEDA programme to help solve our problem.
For an institution that tells us that what was agreed in Berlin was set in concrete, I think the Council has a bit of a cheek in moving large sums of money from the MEDA programme which they agreed 12 months ago and then lecturing us about what can and cannot be moved.
Having said that, we are of course, prepared to listen to the Council, to hear what their suggestions are and I look forward to our trialogue this week and the conciliation meeting on 20 July.
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for her excellent report.
The report under discussion concerns Parliament' s provisional position on the budget in the conciliation talks that are to be held.
Just as Mr Wynn said, the problems really mainly concern Category 4: External Action, and the reconstruction of the Balkans.
Last Spring the Commission proposed the so-called CARDS programme for the reconstruction of the Western Balkans.
Its total value is EUR 5.5 billion.
EUR 1.9 billion has already been found for the programme; of the remainder, EUR 1.4 billion would be found by the reallocation of Category 4 funds, and 1.8 billion by moving funds from the section of the budget dealing with agriculture.
The sum to be reallocated is therefore approximately 5% of the total sum under Category 4, so that it may be technically possible, given there is sufficient political will.
However, the use of agricultural expenditure for the reconstruction of Kosovo is not fair, as each EU citizen must play a part in the work and not just the farming community.
In addition, the future needs of agriculture are hard to estimate, as the Agenda 2000 reforms are only just starting and the WTO talks are in their elementary stages.
The Commission' s proposal for the CARDS programme is explicit and our group supports it.
EU Member States have to bear the responsibility for the reconstruction of the Balkans, as most of them were keen supporters of the military action there, and many also took part in it.
Unless the countries of Europe help th-e inhabitants of the Balkans in their reconstruction work, honourably and vigorously, then this could result in a deep feeling of resentment and bitterness that could last for generations.
Military action is always an extreme measure, and somebody must always suffer the consequences.
When the Interinstitutional Agreement between the Council and Parliament, which contained the financial perspectives for the years 2000 - 2006, was made, it was forecast that the reconstruction of Kosovo might call for 'fresh' resources.
This is stated in point 3 of Mrs Haug' s report.
The Council has, however, signalled that it will not adopt any amendment to the financial perspectives - not even between categories.
The CARDS programme is so huge that it is impossible to adapt it to the present financial perspectives.
There are two alternatives ahead: to fund just part of the programme, or table an amendment to the financial perspectives.
The Council is responsible for the reconstruction of the Balkans.
If it merely promises money, but is not prepared to give it, its credibility as a global player shrinks.
In that case Parliament will have to act within the framework of the financial perspectives, which will mean severe cutbacks in the CARDS programme.
Mr President, Mrs Haug is rapporteur in a novel situation.
For the first time since the Berlin Agreement, negotiations will take place in the Council before first reading regarding a possible review of the financial perspective.
My groups welcomes this development.
The Commission' s initiative is necessary in order to finance the Stability Pact for the Balkans.
We also endorse the plan to earmark resources for Serbia in the post-Milosevic era.
Due to the Council' s attitude in last year' s difficult negotiations, there is insufficient trust in political pledges without a financial picture to match.
But although we agree with the thrust of the Commission' s plan, my group would probably have reached different conclusions regarding the size and distribution of the proposed reductions under the external policy heading.
As it stands now, the civil society, i.e. activities by non-governmental organisations in terms of human rights projects, is proportionately having to foot the lion' s share of the bill, and this seems to me a recipe for disaster if we want to achieve stability in the long run.
My group hopes that the Council is prepared to take a constructive stance and at long last to live up to its pledge to make sufficient resources available for new priorities, such as the Stability Pact, without causing lasting damage to existing policy, which is put on the back burner for reasons other than content.
This request has not yet been met - or so it seems, which is detrimental.
The EU' s credibility will be in the balance, and in my opinion, this is a bad start for the further development of the EU' s foreign and security policy.
Mr President, spectrum auctions are pushing up profits in Member States in a manner never before seen.
At the same time the reconstruction of Kosovo, after the illegal war there, is being financed at the expense of other countries receiving aid, in a way that is improper and dishonest.
Our group supports the former position expressed by Parliament, according to which the Council must agree to amend the financial perspectives, particularly with regard to Category 4.
Waging wars and rebuilding countries must not be allowed to happen at the expense of former preferences in the budget.
We also support the committee' s position according to which expenditure set aside for a common foreign and security policy is operational expenditure, which must remain the budgetary responsibility of the Commission.
That will clarify the context in which discharge is granted.
Furthermore, the granting of discharge must also concern a common foreign and security policy.
However, we will not support the Council and Commission line wherein the main political focus will not shift at all towards the prevention of unemployment.
Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, we spent this morning discussing institutional affairs with President Jacques Chirac and this afternoon discussing budgetary matters which really amounts to one and the same thing.
Firstly, the budget with its EUR 93 million in payment appropriations represents a 5% increase, whereas national budgets are subject to greater austerity.
However, the European agricultural budget is also experiencing a period of austerity, even though outwardly it appears to have grown by 7%.
Agricultural revenue has dropped and so this 7% is a mere illusion; we have simply moved from a price support policy to an income support policy.
We are witnessing the continued, and wholly scandalous, misappropriation of EUR 300 million of agricultural funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as though the Balkans formed part of the CAP!
The CAP is being drastically cut back to the advantage of the CFSP and, as you will see, this is being carried out with no modification to the Treaties.
We are here as part of a consultation procedure that the Treaties do not provide for and we are operating within the framework of an Interinstitutional Agreement of May 1999 that the Treaties do not provide for either.
Over the past 20 years, non-essential expenditure has increased from 5% to more than 45% of the total budget expenditure without any modification to the Treaties.
We have carried out an institutional revolution, to Parliament' s advantage, without an IGC.
Does this mean that the institutions are to adapt spontaneously or that the European Commission and Council will be able to operate with 20-21 members just as they do with 15 and, empirically speaking, solutions will be found?
If at the IGC in Nice we tried to make enlargement conditional upon deepening, this would be viewed as a pretext for delaying the entry of the countries of the East, and Poland has recently voiced its displeasure at this.
We are all aware that the accession of the countries of the East would mean a budgetary revolution and increased taxes.
In other words, the revolution that looks set to take place in European affairs over the coming ten years is not an institutional one but a budgetary and tax one.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Haug report is a good report, particularly the part that deals with cuts in agriculture, which, in my opinion, are the key issue.
It is a mistake to make cuts in heading 1, for agriculture is an essential factor in our economy, the economy of the European Union.
Agriculture is certainly a fundamental part of any debate on boosting development or employment, not because any of us are agriculture lobbyists but because agriculture must not lose its funding.
This point must be stressed, although the report also stresses the difficulty of finding sources of funding for that most remarkable and certainly important operation to be carried out in Kosovo.
My question is this: is it possible to carry out the Kosovo operation without taking funds away from other credit lines in our budget?
And the answer is that yes, it is possible, it can be done without cutting other credit lines or interfering with sectors which are fundamental for the development of the economy within the European Union but rather giving them financial security for, if we do not do so, we will certainly weaken the European market and the euro against their competitors, NAFTA and the dollar.
Therefore, since we profess to have an ongoing budgetary policy which must certainly be focused chiefly on boosting economic development and the economic growth of the individual countries, it is not at all sensible to be financing operations such as the Kosovo operation if this means that we cannot predict the extent to which we will be able to finance budget credit lines.
Moreover, the very fact that the Council is setting a precedent by including Special Envoys and all our special interventions in its own budget lines is a serious matter.
This must stop.
It must be seen as highly negative.
In my opinion, if we invert this trend, we will be doing a great favour to both our economy and Parliament.
Mr President, Budget 2001 must not be to the detriment of agriculture.
As such, I welcome the conclusion reached by the Committee on Budgets, pursuant to which there will be no introduction of compulsory personal insurance for the purpose of evening out fluctuations in the pig prices.
However we must take action to ensure that the level of income, and thus the standard of living of those employed in the agricultural sector does not get any worse.
Our farmers are not just our food producers, they also conserve our landscape.
If we close their businesses because their work no longer pays then our landscape will become increasingly desolate.
This will impinge on us all.
Therefore we must speak out against any attempt to make cuts in the budget that will harm agriculture.
The principle of financing the poor at the expense of other poor people has no place in Europe.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
I also congratulate her on her efforts to reach a consensus, which is a very difficult job.
There is an irrefutable fact in her report: category 4, which was approved in Berlin, may become insufficient if we continue to add the funding of new commitments.
On the other hand, the implementation figures for programmes outside the European Union are very poor and in some cases this is the fault of third countries and in others, the majority of cases, it is the fault of the Commission.
What is clear is that the budgetary implementations do not match the effort made in recent years to introduce these programmes into the budget.
Furthermore, we have the problem of the European Councils.
Every six months we have new commitments to finance because the Council has identified new priorities without consulting Parliament.
Over time, all of this is resulting in a postponement of the decision on the non-obligatory expenses incurred by the Council, and this decision and postponement were not provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement.
To sum up, I would like to say that Terence Wynn' s position seems to me to be very coherent.
This is logical, since he is also chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
I believe that - as he says - we must enter into trialogue with very open minds.
It is clear that nobody is managing to give a reliable estimate of what is needed in Kosovo.
It is also true that if we have to cut the external programmes, we must do so according to a principle of linearity and if it is not done in that way, somebody somewhere is assuming a very great responsibility.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Interinstitutional Agreement is something this House must maintain.
If anybody is going to be irresponsible, let it not be us.
Mr President, it was to be expected, but it always causes a certain degree of anxiety, mixed with impatience, to see once again that the negotiation of the European budget still leads to the conflict so typical of recent years.
This is almost a carbon copy of the procedure for the 2000 budget.
Once again, the insufficiency of what was adopted in Berlin, in March 1999, for external policy, rocks the foundations of the Community budget.
The Council' s short-sightedness hinders any logical solution.
Rather than a budgetary cycle, ladies and gentlemen, it appears that we have a budgetary big wheel.
Somehow or other, the Commission has honoured its commitment to propose a multi-annual plan for the Balkans.
However, sincerely, I agree to a large extent with the Council' s criticism that the figures do not seem particularly well founded.
As the former MEP, Lord Tomlinson, said, there is nothing more expensive than a meal amongst Foreign Affairs Ministers: they are always ready to promise money without considering where it will come from.
I truly believe that the proposal is rather inappropriate and has no sense of time.
They are proposing to move funds intended for agriculture to foreign policy and these proposals have not even been accepted by the United Kingdom.
Just imagine.
That is no way to make progress.
With regard to Serbia, they propose more than EUR 2 billion over the period.
I would like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that in order to topple Pinochet, the European Community spent EUR 10 million.
Our contribution to the campaign against Pinochet in the referendum was EUR 10 million.
We spend EUR 40 million a year on the democratic forces in Serbia and they are asking for two hundred and something more.
When Milosevic falls, I will be the first to accept a revision of the financial perspectives.
However, meanwhile, let us forget the annual EUR 200 million from now until the end of the period.
Let us not push things to the limit.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I do not know if the Council is aware of the real situation.
If it rules out - as it has ruled out - moving money from category 1A, Agriculture, to category 4, and does not accept any increase in the ceiling of category 4 for foreign policy, and all of this must be done by means of a redistribution of resources, we are simply dealing with a case of a non-revision of the financial perspectives.
We are simply dealing with a case of budgetary procedure in the field of non-obligatory expenditure and, therefore, the most that could be said would be that the Council has not complied with Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to make some general comments about the 2001 Budget.
In respect of the fisheries budget, I note that an increase of over 27% is proposed in the funding of international agreements.
These are the southern agreements with third countries which enable EU vessels to fish in the waters of Morocco, Mauritania, Argentina and elsewhere.
I must remind the House that these agreements currently cost EU taxpayers EUR 269 million a year and are primarily of benefit to the fishing fleets of Spain, Portugal and France.
These southern agreements are always calculated on a cash-for-fish basis while northern agreements on the other hand are arranged on a reciprocal basis.
It is this disparity between southern and northern Member States which is evident in the CAP as well as in the CFP budget.
For example, the Commission recently announced an arbitrary cut in export refunds which will cost the Scotch whisky industry around EUR 32 million a year.
Their explanation was simply that Scotch whisky is a rich industry and therefore does not require any subsidy.
Why then do we discover that it is intended to increase the subsidy to wine growers by 64.5% next year, taking the budget to over EUR 1 billion?
Why is the olive oil industry receiving an 8.9% increase providing them with almost EUR 2.5 billion next year, and most shockingly of all, how on earth can we justify giving to tobacco growers an increase of 2.8% taking their subsidies to over EUR 1 billion when we know that tobacco products kill half a million of our citizens every year.
Meanwhile, the beleaguered dairy sector with dairy farmers suffering across the EU will receive a paltry increase of funding of only 0.3%.
Let us make sure the budget is for all EU citizens and not just for the southern EU Member States.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur explained, today' s debate is by way of preparation for the Council' s first reading of the 2001 Budget on 20 July, mainly so as to be able to discuss in detail the votes on compulsory expenditure, i.e. agricultural market expenditure, fisheries expenditure, the fisheries agreements and the draft for the external and security policy expenditure.
Consequently, we have the opportunity this week, to set the appropriate course for the trialogue.
The trialogue will probably major on the general growth rates for the 2001 Budget as compared with the 2000 financial year.
To reiterate the point once again, the Commission proposal provides for an increase of 5% in the payment appropriations, and an increase of 3.9% in the commitment appropriations.
It was not easy to achieve this outcome because the additional requirements for the Stability Pact had to be accommodated and Agenda 2000 involved adopting a very high growth rate in respect of agricultural policy.
The Council made the proposal in its preliminary preparations in the Budget Committee that a growth rate of only 3.5% in respect of payment appropriations and 2.8% in respect of commitment appropriations be provided for, and of course it would only be possible to sustain a drop of that magnitude, given the high proportion of expenditure on agriculture, if we were to make larger cutbacks under the agriculture heading than the Commission has proposed.
I am really quite amazed that the Council' s Budget Committee has already proposed more far-reaching savings in the agricultural sector than the Commission, notably to the tune of half a billion euros.
This beggars belief given the debates that have taken place in the public arena on the Commission proposal, but of course the question remains as to how willing people are to say that savings of this kind can be employed in other areas.
A case in point is that of the question mark over external policy aid.
This is where the Council, unlike the Commission, is proposing a reduced package of EUR 400 million in commitment appropriations.
The Commission considers this proposal to be lacking in the necessary political foresight, in view of the tasks we have before us on the external policy front.
Naturally the Commission welcomes Parliament' s support in respect of the Balkans policy, and I would like to thank you for this, and especially for having this debate, which I believe has afforded some crucial insights.
The Council says that the Balkans policy is a high priority, but it is has still made an inadequate financing proposal in my view.
The Commission has pointed out that aid for Bosnia is being cut, for example, and that Albania and Montenegro have not exactly been generously provided for in terms of appropriations, on the contrary, only one commitment is being honoured in our view.
We must also be sure to provide the necessary funding for the commitments we have in Kosovo - which, thankfully, are now being administered effectively owing to the reconstruction agency - so as to be able to pursue a successful policy here, because this area, more than any other, is a touchstone for the European Union' s common foreign policy.
I would like briefly to go into the issue of the fisheries agreements.
We will certainly have an unusual situation to contend with in 2001, given that numerous agreements are due to be renegotiated or extended, even though it is not yet clear as to when the agreements will be re-concluded and at what cost.
This could easily lead to a shortfall in the appropriations provided, although I believe there is in fact support for the Commission' s proposal not to provide too low a level of appropriations here.
The Commission will submit its new estimate of the necessary expenditure in October, whereupon it will be possible to plan more precisely for this sector than is perhaps the case at present.
Speakers have mentioned in the course of their interventions that there are serious differences of opinion, particularly where the revision of the financial perspective is concerned.
On behalf of the Commission, I can only repeat once again that as far as we are concerned, our mission in the Balkans - which could not be taken account of in last year' s financial planning - is so important that we are right to make an adjustment.
That really is not to say that we should decide to amend the financial perspective every time there is a fresh requirement, only that the Commission believes we are justified in doing so when important new tasks crop up.
There is another point I would like to make on behalf of the Commission, and it concerns the field of external policy.
We have proposed that EUR 30 million be earmarked in the 2001 Budget for the Rapid Reaction Fund, which is used for non-military crisis prevention.
The Council has proposed that the fund should take a cut of EUR 10 million and that the appropriations for CFSP should be increased by 10 million in return.
It is the Commission' s belief that we ought not to weaken this new instrument of non-military crisis management, i.e. the Rapid Reaction Fund, from the outset.
I have this to say about Mrs Haug' s report: you have issued another reminder that the Commission must also come up with the documents it has promised in respect of the administration of the external policy, under the heading 'externalisation' .
I would again point out that we are working very hard on finding a solution that will centralise control over the project cycle in the future, mainly - and this is a major area of concern to me personally - so as to reduce the amount of time between the moment we engage in overseas commitments and the point at which funds are ultimately released.
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets.
I hope we may be able to use the next few weeks to find more common ground than differences of opinion, so as to be able to get off to a good start with the budgetary negotiations.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0532/00).
We will examine questions to the Council, which is represented by Mr Moscovici, Minister for European Affairs, who many of you will know since he is a former Member of the European Parliament.
Question No 1 by (H-0518/00):
Subject: Common foreign and security policy In view of the imminent development of a common foreign and security policy within the Treaty, what arrangements will the Presidency be making to ensure that Parliament is kept fully informed and is properly consulted in this field?
In particular, when will Mr Alain Richard, Minister of Defence, be willing to appear at a part-session?
Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union provides that the presidency shall consult the European Parliament on key issues and fundamental decisions with regard to the common foreign and security policy, and ensure that account is duly taken of the views of the European Parliament.
Rest assured that the French Presidency will scrupulously adhere to such provisions.
This is particularly true as regards recent developments in common foreign and security policy as a result of the Feira European Council and with a view to the one in Nice.
As you are all aware, the common foreign and security policy is one of the major European projects as well as one of the priorities of the French presidency, as the French President, Mr Jacques Chirac pointed out this morning in his address.
As Mr Alain Richard, French Minister of Defence, has already pointed out, he has every intention of addressing the European Parliament on as yet unspecified dates.
I should also like to point out that either Hubert Védrine or I will address the Committee on Foreign Affairs each month on Tuesday afternoon after the 'General Affairs' Council meeting.
In this way we shall be able to keep the European Parliament informed of defence-related matters.
Thank you, Minister, for your first response during your presidency.
I am especially pleased that we are able to see Mr Richard here.
It is extremely important that the growth of our European security and defence policy commands full public support and respect, and strong and credible parliamentary scrutiny is certainly the way forward.
I simply wanted to highlight the willingness of the French Government and in particular the Minister of Defence, to debate such matters openly with the European Parliament.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, consensus was achieved at the Feira Summit a couple of weeks ago on the idea that flexibility should be on the IGC agenda.
At the meeting, however, no further details were given as to how flexibility can apply also to the second pillar, that is to say, to a common foreign and security policy.
I would like to ask when the country holding the presidency of the Council will present its own point of view regarding how the flexibility clause can be implemented with respect to the second pillar.
If and when that happens, will those Member States not in NATO be automatically excluded from those decisions, taken on the basis of flexibility, which lead to some Member States proceeding more swiftly along the path to a common defence?
I refer in particular to the statement made last week by Alain Richard, Minister for Defence of the country holding the presidency, in which he expressed his concern in the event that non-aligned countries are fully involved from the start in second pillar development projects.
As you will be aware Mrs Kauppi, the matter of relations between the Member States of the European Union that are not part of NATO took up a considerable amount of discussion time at the Feira European Council and it is well on the way to a successful conclusion.
As regards the flexibility of the second pillar, perhaps you will allow the presidency to take the Intergovernmental Conference in hand, which it will do following the 'General Affairs Council' next Monday, 10 July.
We shall then be able to determine the various views on this matter.
I should like to remind you that the role of the presidency is to successfully oversee the running of the IGC and not state the positions adopted by the various Member States.
I am very pleased to see the President-in-Office here, as a former Member of Parliament.
Will he, in the Nice Treaty or in the negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Nice at the end of the year, propose codecision between Parliament and the Council on matters of common foreign and security policy?
This is to be the lower House, as the President of the Republic told us this morning and if we are to carry public opinion with us in security and defence matters we need a proper position.
So does he agree that codecision is the way forward in this policy area?
Mr Newton Dunn, I stand by my previous response.
I would remind Members in general that we must ask questions.
That is what Question Time is for.
The President-in-Office of the Council replies to the questions in the way he sees fit.
Question No 2 by (H-0519/00):
Subject: Transport of water from France to Spain and the sustainable management of water resources France is understood to be intending to launch an aqueduct scheme for transporting water from the Rhône to Barcelona, with the participation of the Lyonnaise water company.
The water is apparently intended to be used to develop irrigated intensive farming in Catalonia.
This scheme goes against all principles of sustainable management of water resources at the regional level.
Is the Council aware of this scheme?
Does the Council not take the view that such a course of action is contrary to the precautionary principle and the principle of preventive action in respect of the environment as laid down in Article 174 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as it removes responsibility from the consumers of water which has been transported from elsewhere?
What steps does the Council intend to take with a view to promoting a policy of sustainable management of water resources in the EU and in order that schemes for transporting water over long distances do not threaten the ecological balance in the regions concerned?
Council.
(FR) There is indeed a project, or rather studies, in progress with regard to the transportation of water from the Rhone to Catalonia, but - for the time being at least - it does not involve the French or Spanish authorities.
What is more, the European Parliament and the Council have put forward a proposal for a directive establishing a framework for a community water policy.
It was adopted recently through a conciliation procedure on 29 June 2000.
