Mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
The mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000.
By its resolution 1565 (2004) of 1 October 2004, the Council extended the deployment of MONUC until 31 March 2005, authorized the increase of its strength by 5,900 personnel, including up to 341 civilian police personnel, as well as the deployment of appropriate civilian personnel, appropriate and proportionate air mobility assets and other force enablers, and decided that MONUC would have the mandate set out in paragraphs 4, 5 and 7 of the resolution.
By its resolution 1592 (2005) of 30 March 2005, the Council extended the mandate of MONUC until 1 October 2005, with the intention to renew it for further periods.
The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to maintain international peace and security in the region.
By its resolution 59/285 of 13 April 2005, the General Assembly approved a revised appropriation for MONUC for the 2004/05 period, endorsed the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/59/735) on the revised 2004/05 budget for the Mission and requested the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation.
In view of the recent approval of the revised appropriation for MONUC for the 2004/05 period and the time required to address in the next budget for the Mission the recommendations of the Advisory Committee, in particular those regarding linkages between the requested financial and human resources and the increase in troop strength or newly mandated activities, changes in the Mission's organizational structure and an analysis of resources and capacities already available in the Mission, the 2005/06 budget for MONUC will be submitted to the General Assembly during the main part of its sixtieth session.
Pending consideration by the General Assembly of the full budget for MONUC for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, including results-based frameworks, immediate cash and additional human resources are needed to support additional military personnel and meet the operational requirements of the Mission.
Pursuant to the recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee and endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 59/285, the present commitment authority request includes 317 additional essential posts (127 international and 190 national staff) and 52 United Nations Volunteer positions to support the Mission's expansion, and also reflects the proposed establishment of a Personnel Conduct Office (7 international and 4 national staff), for a total of 380 additional civilian personnel (134 international, 194 national and 52 United Nations Volunteers).
The provisional establishment of these temporary posts is requested without prejudice to the decision the General Assembly may take during the main part of its sixtieth session following the consideration of the proposed staffing establishment of the Mission for the 2005/06 financial period.
Pursuant to section IV, paragraph 2, of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994, the present report contains a request for commitment authority, with assessment, in the amount of $383,187,800 to meet the operating costs of MONUC for the period from 1 July to 31 October 2005.

In its resolution 1565 (2004), the Security Council mandated MONUC to establish three joint commissions with a view to assisting the Transitional Government in security-sector reform, essential legislation and elections.
The status of the implementation of the Security Council mandate with regard to the electoral process is described in paragraph 35 of the sixteenth report of the Secretary-General on MONUC, dated 31 December 2004 (S/2004/1034).
While major challenges to meeting the electoral schedule remain, including logistical aspects of the elections and delays in the passage of essential legislation, it is proposed that 16 additional electoral personnel, considered essential to augment the Mission's capacity to provide advice and assistance to the Transitional Government and provincial authorities in the preparations for elections, be deployed.
