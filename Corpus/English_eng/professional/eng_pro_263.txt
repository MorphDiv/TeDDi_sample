Agenda item 108
Programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005
Strengthened and unified security management system for the United Nations: standardized access control
* The present report is prepared in compliance with section XI of resolution 59/276 of 23 December 2004, following consultations undertaken within the Secretariat.
Report of the Secretary-General*
By section XI of its resolution 59/276 of 23 December 2004, the General Assembly created the new Department of Safety and Security under the direction of the Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security.
The Under-Secretary-General assumed his duties on 28 February 2005.
One of the first priorities of the Department was to review the security requirements relating to access control.
Consequently, it has been determined that the implementation of a standardized access control system at all main locations would require a high level of integration and coordination, and project management and delivery mechanisms would need to be defined from the inception of the project to ensure its ultimate success.
Accordingly, it is intended to establish a project management structure called the “project access control team”, with the aim of planning and, in the event the project is later approved by the General Assembly, coordinating the implementation of a comprehensive, fully integrated and standardized access control system, in close consultation with the Office of Central Support Services.
The project access control team, to be composed of security specialists from the Department of Safety and Security and professionals from the Office of Central Support Services with expertise in information technology and facilities management, would be accountable and report directly to the Under-Secretary-General for Safety and Security.
The team would lead a global, Secretariat-wide working group comprised of all the required disciplines and would be supported by consultants for specific tasks whenever in-house expertise is not available.
The project access control team would commence its work by reviewing the study that had been undertaken in preparation of the reports of the Secretary-General (A/59/365 and A/59/365/Add.1), as well as the external validation of the project that had been conducted at the time.
Following this review and further studies as may be required, a detailed preliminary design and cost analysis would be undertaken.
The proposal would include viable alternatives where possible and assessment of their impact on achieving Headquarters Minimum Operating Security Standards, as well as measures to prevent cost overruns.
It is anticipated that the time frame for the planning and preliminary design of the project would be six to nine months.
Furthermore, the implementation phase would take 18 to 24 months, for a total project duration of 24 to 33 months.
This projected time frame would also be subject to review by the project access control team.
Specifically, the preliminary design will encompass solutions for:
• Pass issuance and control
• Individuals' access control
• Vehicle access control
• Perimeter security monitoring
• Response to incidents
• Security Control Centre.
A progress report on the project would be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.
The report would address in detail the request made by the Assembly in section XI, paragraph 44, of its resolution 59/276 regarding the integration of the proposed access control system with projects already approved, its impact on human resources requirements, the individual characteristics of each United Nations headquarters and main duty stations, the implications of the project for the capital master plan, the operational management of the global identity management system and the timetable for implementation.
The project access control team will be set up from within existing resources for the duration of the project.
It will be supplemented by additional resources in the amount of up to $180,000 to hire specialized expertise on an as-needed basis.
Every effort would be made to accommodate the additional requirements arising from the procurement of outside expertise from within the overall resources approved for the biennium 2004-2005 and proposed in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 under section 33, Department of Safety and Security.
Conclusion and recommendation
The Secretary-General recommends that the General Assembly endorse the course of action proposed in the present report.
