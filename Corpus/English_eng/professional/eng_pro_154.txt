Annex to the letter dated 3 January 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Argentina to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
[Original: English and Spanish]
On 3 January 1833, British forces occupied the Malvinas Islands, forcibly expelling its inhabitants and the Argentine authorities legitimately established there.
Today, 172 years after that illegitimate occupation which still continues, the Argentine people and Government reaffirm the imprescriptible sovereignty rights of the Argentine Republic over the Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.
Likewise, they recall the permanent and unrelinquishable objective, enshrined in the National Constitution, of recovering the full exercise of sovereignty over the above-mentioned territories and maritime areas through peaceful means for the settlement of disputes in accordance with international law and respecting the way of life and the interests of the inhabitants of the Malvinas Islands.
The Argentine Government reaffirms the need to carry out the numerous resolutions of the United Nations and declarations of the Organization of American States, which urge the resumption of bilateral negotiations in order to find as soon as possible a just, peaceful and lasting solution to the dispute over sovereignty.
It also recalls its permanent readiness to immediately resume those negotiations and exhorts the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to show, without further delay, the same readiness to fulfil those appeals by the international community.
