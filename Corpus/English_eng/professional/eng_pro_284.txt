Agenda item 105
Human rights questions
Letter dated 6 May 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
I have the honour to transmit herewith the text of the statement made by the representative of Ukraine at a meeting of the Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe held on 5 May 2005 (see annex).
The statement concerns the administrative punishment of the Ukrainian citizens who participated in a peaceful humanitarian action on the theme “Chornobyl's Road”, in Minsk, Belarus, on 26 April 2005.
I would be grateful if the present letter and its annex were distributed as a document of the General Assembly, under item 105 of the agenda of its fifty-ninth session.
(Signed) Valeriy Kuchinsky
