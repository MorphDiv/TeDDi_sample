Coordination between the African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW), African regional economic communities and river and lake basin organizations and key institutions
Note by the secretariat
The architecture of the governance of Africa has been significantly altered in recent times.
The African Union has come into existence and serves as the over-arching regional body for the continent.
It was established to accelerate the process of political and economic integration within the continent.
The Union carries out this function by promoting and supporting cooperation between and among African countries.
Among its many other functions, the Union provides a n enabling forum for African countries to work together to establish initiatives that promote proper development and use of water resources.
The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has as one of its aims the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development.
In view of the above strategic considerations, regional cooperation between and among key institutions in Africa must be accorded top priority.
[up to here, identivcal to the doc under a.i. 3 - will anyone notice is this intentional?
] Furthermore, the pursuit of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Africa provides a compelling reason, indeed an obligation, for the African Ministers' Council on Water, African regional economic communities and the river and lake basin organizations in the region to enhance their collaborative links.
The full cooperation of the regional economic communities in Africa must be enlisted in pursuing the objectives of the African Union, NEPAD and the African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW) The institutionalization of such cooperation must be accorded a high degree of attention.
In this regard, the Technical Advisory Committee of the African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW) will formulate specific action proposals regarding options for the institutionalization of future cooperation with the above-mentioned bodies for the consideration of the Executive Committee.
Suggested aAction
The Executive Committee might wish to consider, with a view to its possible approval, the Consideration and approval of the recommendation of the Technical Advisory Committee of the African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW), as appropriate To that end, a draft memorandum of understanding between the Council and secretariats of regional economic communities and river and lake basin organizations is attached in the annex to the present note is a memorandum between African Ministers' Council on Water and the secretariats of regional economic communities and river and lake basin organizations, for the consideration of the Executive Committee [surely we need some sort of flag like this,m to explain what this annex is?!
Perhaps it should be put in the paragraph above - and then it can be covered by the suggested action, as it stands.
I'm too zonked to think about this any more.
