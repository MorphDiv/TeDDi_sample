Professional expertise and skills
Academic and scientific skills
I have been teaching law at the Kinshasa-Gombe University School of Commerce for years and I was a Researcher at the University of Geneva where I still teach International Criminal Law and International Humanitarian Law as a visiting Lecturer.
My field of research: Public International Law, International Criminal Law, International Humanitarian Law, Human Rights, International Organizations, Use of armed force, Cooperation Europe — Developing countries, Competition Law, Law of Environment and Child Rights.
Judicial, legal and administrative expertise
Military Magistrate to the Military Court Martial in Kinshasa, I worked as a Prosecutor and also a Judge.
I was a Legal Officer at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), responsible inter alia of the trials management, hearings and appeals.
I master very well the functioning of the international Justice.
I worked as a Legal Adviser to the Vice-Prime Minister and Human Rights Minister in Kinshasa.
My ability to conduct comprehensive legal analysis is proven.
I have been Legal Adviser to the Police Headquarters and to the Office of the President of the Republic in Kinshasa.
I studied the Administrative Law and I occupied several administrative and management positions.
I have a good knowledge of personnel matters within the UN system and in my capacity of Officer-in-Charge of “Court Management Section” at the UN Tribunal, I also dealt with administrative issues and with management matters as well.
C. Diplomatic skills and international expertise
Thanks to my several internships within the UN, I have acquired a perfect knowledge of the mechanism of the multilateral diplomacy and of the UN system itself.
Naturally, I master all human rights issues.
And I am familiar with the international conferences.
In my capacity as Legal Officer to the Arusha Tribunal, I often travelled to foreign countries to represent this high international jurisdiction.
My assignments consisted in servicing judicial documents (warrants of arrest, orders for transfers and other orders) on Governments (Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Ministers of Justice, Attorneys General, Principal Prosecutors, Supreme Police Commanding Officers), negotiating with States the transfer of the persons accused or suspected by the Tribunal and bringing the detainees to the Seat of the Tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania.
I am familiar with the matters related to the negotiations and agreements between the UN Tribunal and the host Government of Tanzania.
Of course, I have acquired a great deal of experience in drafting correspondence related to such matters.
In my capacity as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of my country to the Swiss Confederation in Bern, the bilateral diplomacy is my daily duty.
And my functions as Head of diplomatic Mission and Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva and in Vienna, as well as my present annual mandate as Chairman of the Group of 77 and China, make me familiar with the multilateral diplomacy which allows people to meet and to cooperate fruitfully.
I firmly believe in the richness of the cultural diversity.
Proven drafting skills
My legal and political analysis, my correspondence as well as the reports I write in both French and English show a very high standard of my drafting skills.
At the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, sometimes I participated in the drafting of decisions and judgements.
And as Head of diplomatic Missions, my drafting skills are proven on a daily basis in both Bern and Geneva at several international forums.

I was engaged by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) based in Geneva as a Human Rights Expert/International Observer at the trial of the former Head of State of Malawi, Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda and three others for Human Rights violations during his rule.
My mandate at the trial of Dr. Banda and three others included the following:
- To obtain information about the conduct of the trial, the nature of the case against the accused and the legal framework under which they were being tried.
- To collect more general background information about the political and legal circumstances leading to the trial.
- To advertise before the court, the relevant authorities in Malawi and to the general and international public, the international interest and concern in the trial.
In particular, I was to ascertain whether:
- the trial was being conducted in accordance with the due process of the law;
- the trial was fair in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights;
Verify whether the following principles were applied viz:
- the independence of the judicial authorities;
- the right of the accused to legal representation;
- prohibition of torture;
- access to a family lawyer/doctor;
- the principle of non-retroactivity of laws;
- the right to a public and expeditious trial;
- the presumption of innocence;
- the right to appeal.
I held discussions with the relevant authorities in Malawi to bring to their attention the nature of my mission and to seek their assistance and cooperation in carrying out my mandate.
I was allowed a number of house visits to the accused on Police Bond, viz, Dr. Banda and Ms. Cecilia Kazamira and a number of prison visits to the other two accused in custody throughout my mandate.
I attended court sessions, in a specially provided prominent position in the courtroom.

In due course, all four accused were acquitted of the offences charged.

- Undertook preliminary studies and consultations with all interested parties, with a view to establishing a legislative and legal framework to safeguard human rights in Malawi, which culminated in the repeal of the old Constitution and other laws to prepare Malawi for the holding of multi-party democratic elections.
From May-June 1993:
I was commissioned by the ICJ as a Human Rights Expert/International Observer and Coordinator of a five-member Observer Mission to Malawi to observe the holding of a National Referendum to determine the future political system for Malawi.
The referendum question was whether Malawi should remain a One Party State or adopt a Multi-Party system of Government.
