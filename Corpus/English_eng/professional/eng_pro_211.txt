Annex I to the letter dated 4 March 2005 from the Permanent Representatives of Georgia and the Republic of Moldova addressed to the Secretary-General
On the supremacy of democratic values and principles
The people of the Republic of Moldova and Georgia affirm their strong support for the principles and values of democracy, recognizing representative democracy to be the most sound model of fair and effective governance.
We hereby affirm democracy to be the only form of government that can guarantee the establishment of strong States, who, in the process of nation-building, seek to strengthen civil society and its institutions, ensure political accountability, defend social justice and majority rule with minority rights, uphold free press and the media, and thereby secure the rule of law and protection of fundamental human rights.
The Republic of Moldova and Georgia strive to establish a society in which every individual feels secure and protected and in which the State guarantees the protection of basic freedoms and liberties in a climate absent of fear or uncertainty.
We collectively affirm that popular support is the crucial test of a modern democratic government, for in a democracy a government's legitimacy depends on the support it receives in the form of a plurality of votes cast.
We further believe that there is no alternative to free and fair elections in the countries that have emerged from totalitarian dictatorship and foreign rule, and that no external force can prevent freedom-loving peoples from voting and electing their leadership in accordance with their aspirations and beliefs.
In this respect, no one should be allowed to impose their alien will on people from the outside; no one should be allowed to influence the outcome of the elections; or try to change the political course of a country through blackmail or any form of illegal financial operations.
Free and fair elections bring power to people, thus eliminating the power of cleptocratic pseudo-elites.
We hereby call on all democratic States to support the aspirations of our peoples.
Furthermore, we ask that the community of democratic nations provide support to shield us from any form of illegal interference from outside that endangers democratic processes taking place in our countries.
The Republic of Moldova affirms its commitment to honouring the genuine democratic expression and will of its people, and urges the largest possible number of election observers from established democracies, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other international organizations with authority to come to the Republic of Moldova, as we trust these observers to impartially monitor the elections.
We believe in the validity and universality of these fundamental democratic achievements.
Furthermore, we are sure that the Government of the Republic of Moldova will be elected as a result of free and fair elections, not through external threats that include economic sanctions and the attempts of corrupt clans to return to power with support from yesterday's masters.
This dynamic process should give new impetus to the GUUAM group of countries to become a safeguard of democratic principles and values for the entire organization and its member States.
The new challenges that the member States face should be reflected in the actions and purpose of this organization.
Taken together, these new realities imply new functions and goals, transforming GUUAM into a promoter of democracy, stability and security in the entire region.
We are confident that these new principles will be implemented intensively starting from 22 April 2005, when the Republic of Moldova assumes the chairmanship of GUUAM.
In defence of freedom and for the advancement of stability and democracy, we hereby affirm our collective desire to participate in the construction of a new, United Europe, based on our common European heritage and identity and our shared European values.

Annex II to the letter dated 4 March 2005 from the Permanent Representatives of Georgia and the Republic of Moldova to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
Against the “Black Holes” in Europe
The Republic of Moldova and Georgia reaffirm the need for full respect of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all States and the inviolability of international borders, requiring continued international efforts in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the commitments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the fundamental principles of international law and European norms and practices.
On this basis, we strive to eliminate threats to international peace and security stemming from aggressive separatism, with a view to resolving the externally inspired protracted conflicts in both our countries.
Zones of conflict and separatist territories have become “black holes” in our countries and are openly supported from the outside.
These territories function as criminal havens where massive contraband enriches a few corrupt leaders, while the populations live in poverty; where basic human rights are disregarded; where hundreds of thousands remain outside their native homes and where arms smuggling, human and drug trafficking, and kidnapping are considered “business as usual”.
In illegally controlled territories of Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, separatists violate even the most basic rights of children.
Thus in Transnistria, schools are persecuted, the Latin alphabet is banished.
In the Gali region of Abkhazia, teachers are prohibited to teach their students in their native Georgian language.
The presence and direct involvement of foreign military forces in the Republic of Moldova and in Georgia has become the main catalyst of these conflicts.
Therefore, the speedy removal of the foreign military forces from the territory of the two countries represents the common interest of our countries and the entire region.
The removal of military forces from the territories of our States is in the interest of the Russian Federation itself; good relations with the Russian Federation are an important priority for the Republic of Moldova and Georgia.
A friendly and secure region should be in the interest of the Russian Federation as well.
Aggressive separatism in the Republic of Moldova and Georgia has created fertile ground for the imperial ambitions of those who do not want our countries to be free and prosperous.
That is why armed separatism is not a mere term, but rather is a criminal activity; that represents not only a “local problem”, but rather a problem for all Europe.
Therefore, we strongly believe that Europe should not and cannot tolerate these “Black Holes” on Europe's new borders.
The Republic of Moldova and Georgia affirm the importance of multifaceted economic and political measures against armed separatism to enable our countries to become integrated into the Wider Europe and in particular to strengthen our cooperation within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy initiative.
The Republic of Moldova and Georgia will also undertake joint diplomatic steps in international forums against aggressive separatism, which is an antithesis of democracy, and epitomizes totalitarian structures, terrorism, massive violation of human rights, trafficking, arms and drug smuggling, unlawful trade and money-laundering, transnational corruption.
The Republic of Moldova and Georgia hereby declare that:
• We affirm and declare our support for a society in which the rights of all citizens are equally protected regardless of their nationality, political beliefs, sex and confession.
• We affirm and declare our support for a society, in which the cultural and language rights of all the ethnic communities are guaranteed and secured.
• We affirm and declare our support for the exclusively peaceful resolution of the conflicts taking into consideration the interests of all the people residing on these territories.
• We affirm and declare our support so that the people in the separatist-ruled territories to rejoin us in the framework of democratic States and of peaceful Europe.
• We affirm and declare our support to ensure shared and equal benefits that stem from our common European heritage which has its roots in European civilization and prosperity.
• And we hereby affirm and declare the Republic of Moldova and Georgia's foremost goal to complete the process of joining Europe.
Let all of us join Europe together and help complete the third wave of European liberation.
