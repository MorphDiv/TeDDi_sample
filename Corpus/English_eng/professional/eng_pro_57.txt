Fifth meeting of the Executive Committee of the
African Ministers' Council on Water
Addis Ababa, 29-30 June 2005
Item 6(a) of the provisional agenda
Report of the African Commission
Draft 16-06-
The Commission for Africa report and initiatives of the African Ministers' Council on Water
Introduction
Over the last three years, the African Ministers' Council on Water has made a number of ministerial commitments that constitute a set of measures required to tackle the water and sanitation challenges in the region.
Since its inception in April 2002, the Council has concentrated on promoting implementation mechanisms and partnerships on water with a view, in particular, to identifying how best to achieve, by 2015, targets for access to safe water and improved sanitation through the development of strategic approaches.
The achievement of those targets requires the promotion of improved water governance and forging of new partnerships on water, including the design and implementation of effective integrated water resource management and efficiency plans.
The release of the report of the Commission for Africa, which was established by British Prime Minister Mr. Tony Blair, in preparation for the 2005 Group of Eight (G-8) summit, is particularly timely and welcome in view of the above challenges and the Council's response to them.
The report, entitled “Our common interest”, contains ten chapters, as follows:
(a) The case for action;
(b) Lost decades: legacies and causes;
(c) Through African eyes: culture;
(d) Getting systems right: capacity-building;
(e) The need for peace and security;
(f) Leaving no-one out: investing in people;
(g) Going for growth and poverty reduction;
(h) More trade and fairer trade;
(i) Where will the money come from: resources; and
(j) Making it happen.
Challenges
The report (in paragraphs 65-72) accords special attention to the water policy challenges in Africa and to the Council's leadership role in addressing them.
Selected excerpts from the report are presented below.
Access to water is a right and a basic need.
It is consistently among the top three or four priorities of poor people in Africa, especially women and girls who shoulder primary responsibility for securing and managing domestic water.
International commitments include the MDG to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015.
Water and sanitation were also highlighted in the urgent call for slum upgrading at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002.
African leaders have also developed the more ambitious Africa Water Vision, which seeks a 75 per cent reduction in the proportion of people lacking access to safe water and sanitation by 2015 and by 95 per cent by 2025.
However, despite the emphasis put on water at the Kyoto Forum and the Evian G8 Summit, at current levels of commitment the MDG water target will not be met until 2050 nor the sanitation target by 2100, at the earliest.
The water sector, which includes sanitation, has been neglected in the past, compared to other sectors.
It has received weak or uneven treatment in PRSPs.
Responsibility for water is often split between different government ministries, making it difficult to take a coherent, strategic approach to the sector.
Aid to the sector has fallen by 25 per cent since 1996 and is poorly targeted.
The costs of neglect, which are cumulative, are now better understood than in the past.
A safe, convenient water supply and improved sanitation is a pre-requisite for improving the productivity and quality of life of poor people.
Water is vital to achieving the other MDG, such as poverty reduction, education and gender equality.
For example, providing appropriate toilet facilities in schools is a pre-condition for the education of girls in some countries; carrying water long distances and waiting at water sources wastes energy and time, particularly of women and children, at the expense of family activities, education and productive work; and irrigation is and will increasingly be a pre-requisite to increasing food production to feed the growing African population.
The health benefits of access to clean water and proper sanitation and attention to wastewater treatment are also clear.
Unsafe water and poor sanitation cause intestinal worms, cholera, blindness from trachoma and diarrhoea.
Without clean water, anti-retroviral treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS will be less effective.
The WHO estimates the total annual economic benefit of meeting the water supply and sanitation MDG in Africa to be US$22 billionEffective water resource management is essential if water supply and sanitation services are to be sustained in Africa.
Extreme climate variability, coupled with growing water demand, deteriorating water quality and trans-boundary problems posed by most Africa's river basins, present daunting challenges.
At the same time in most African cities over 50 per cent of the supply is wasted or unaccounted for.
A comprehensive, strategic approach to the water sector is therefore, required, based around integrated water resource management.
This requires regional co-operation over trans-boundary water resources, improved water governance to manage competing needs, and increased and more effective management of investments in water infrastructure.
These issues were all addressed in the G8 Water Action Plan agreed at Evian in 2003.
River basin organisations in Africa require donor support.
The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) is a good example of co-operation in development of water resources in a river basin that is also catalysing wider regional integration.
It aims to reduce poverty through the equitable use of the Nile's water.
Benefits include environmental conservation, flood prevention, increased food production, energy availability and reduced political tension.
We call for more donor support to Africa's river basin organisations.
We recommend that donors fund the basin-wide capacity-building and the preparation of first round investment programmes in the Nile Basin Initiative.
An initial US$60 million is required.
Through this funding, economic integration is supported, with potentially important returns in terms of political stability.
Starting in 2005, the start of the Second UN Water Decade, donors must reverse the decline in aid for water supply and sanitation to enable African governments to achieve the Africa Water Vision commitment.
The G8 should report back, by 2007, on implementation of the G8 Water Action Plan agreed in 2003.
Financing for the water sector forms part of the proposed US$10 billion funding for infrastructure.
It is important to ensure that Governments and donors work together to harmonise future delivery, focusing on those countries most in need.
Funds and capacity to deliver are currently being spread across a variety of different water initiative, which increases transaction costs.
The African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW) is best placed to co-ordinate this and could formally report on progress to the Africa Partners Forum.
To improve effectiveness at the country level, donors must take a sector-wide approach and strengthen overall sector co-ordination.
This should be done through budget support for one national strategy, with one co-ordinating body and one monitoring framework.
African governments must ensure there is multi-stakeholder participation, drawing in representation from rural and urban sectors, poor people, women and men, different levels and departments of government, civil society and the private sector.
They should also ensure that the water supply and sanitation strategy is fully integrated with broader human development and environmental policies at the country level with funding allocated to maximise results.
Recommendations
The report contains the following specific recommendations.
(a) Governance and capacity-building: the report recommends that the continent's regional and pan-African organizations, including the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), need strengthening.
There is a need to invest in capacity-building, to increase accountability and transparency; to fight corruption and strengthen information systems;
(b) Peace and security: the report recommends the need for increased investment in conflict prevention in order to promote the rapid acceleration in development that the African region requires;
(c) Investing in people: the report recognizes the need for African Governments to strengthen governance and ensure the participation of ordinary people and local communities in decisions on development.
This recommendation makes reference to education; health; water and sanitation; HIV and AIDS, as well as the need to protect the most vulnerable;
(d) Growth and poverty reduction: the report recommends increased investment to promote economic growth, while ensuring that the poor participate in the process.
Poverty in Africa will continue to rise unless there is greater economic growth, of a kind in which poor people can participate.
Donor Governments and international institutions, including the World Bank, UNEP and UNDP, should encourage the inclusion of environmental sustainability in African Governments' poverty reduction strategies;
(e) Trade: the report recommends increased trade as a tool for increased economic growth.
African Governments must drive this process and be allowed to develop their own trade policies.
There is a need to support Africa-owned strategies for building the capacity to trade; to dismantle the rich world's trade barriers through the Doha round of world trade negotiations; and to provide transitional support to help Africa adjust to new trading regimes;
(f) Resources: the report recommends an increase in aid to sub-Saharan Africa over the next three-five years.
In order to increase the growth rate in Africa and to make real progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, the volume and quality of external aid to sub-Saharan Africa must change radically.
Additional finance should be raised in various ways, including the immediate launch of the international finance facility;
(g) How to make it happen: the report recommends the establishment of an independent monitoring system.
It recommends that Africa be given greater influence in decision-making and a stronger voice in international forums.
Enabling the Council to address the challenges
In addressing the observations and suggestions of the Commission for Africa, enabling the Council to perform an effective coordinating role will be the highest priority.
The Council is already taking the lead in that coordinating role.
At its fifth session, in November 2004, the Council considered how best to accelerate action to achieve the 2005 integrated water resources management (IWRM) target, as well as the Millennium Development Goal water supply target and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development sanitation target by 2015.
A wide range of decisions were made at that session and agreement was reached on the policy actions required, which include:
(a) Strengthening the governance of the Council to make it more effective as a regional mechanism for promoting cooperation, dialogue and policy development;
(b) Adopting a triennial (2005-2007) work programme and, consequently, establishing the African Ministers' Council on Water trust fund, managed by UNEP with solid support from the European Union, to provide for the implementation of the work programme;
(d) Putting in place an African Water Facility, in partnership with the European Union, NEPAD and United Nations agencies in Africa, to be managed by the African Development Bank, highlighting new forms of partnership that need to be forged if the water and sanitation targets are to be met, a governing council consisting of five Council ministers, five donor representatives, a NEPAD representative and a United Nations representative;
(e) Cooperating with the African Union in the context of the Sirte Declaration on the Challenges of Implementing Integrated and Sustainable Development in Agriculture and Water in Africa, adopted by the heads of State and Government of the Assembly of the African Union at its second extraordinary session, held in Sirte, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, in February 2004;
(f) Cooperating with the G-8 countries within the framework of the G-8 action plan on water, particularly in promoting transboundary initiatives on international waters;
(g) Cooperating with the European Union to implement the European Union Water Initiative for Africa: the European Union and Africa “Water for Life” agreement;
(i) Working closely with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) on implementing the Water for African Cities Programme;
(j) Cooperating with the African Development Bank in the launch and implementation of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative;
(k) Strengthening collaboration with civil society organizations in recognition of their important role in awareness-raising, capacity-building and implementation of water programmes;
(l) Joining forces with the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council in its campaign on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All;
(m) Preparing inventories of major subregional water initiatives, projects and programmes in the five subregions of Africa in order to strengthen the assessment of progress made and needed; and
(n) Preparing a report on water policy challenges and priorities in Africa to inform and inspire the Council's participation in the current policy cycle of the Commission on Sustainable Development.
In addition to the above enabling and coordinating strategies agreed at its fifth session, the Council subsequently announced at the thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development its intention to establish a monitoring and evaluation mechanism for water resources management in Africa, to be housed at the African Water Facility.
This was in recognition of the need to establish, beyond the thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the high-level plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to review progress in the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, an effective mechanism to monitor and review implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.
In order to make the mechanism operational, the Council will take upon itself the responsibility of ensuring regular reporting by member States, coordinated by the regional economic communities.
A dedicated special commission will undertake the analysis and review of national reports.
The African Water Facility will provide institutional backup to the Commission.
The African review mechanism will work within the global review mechanism which is to be established.
