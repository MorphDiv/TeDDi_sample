Operational activities for development: operational activities for development of the United Nations system
Letter dated 11 May 2005 from the Permanent Representatives of Indonesia and South Africa to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly
The Asian-African Summit and Golden Jubilee of the 1955 Asian-African Conference, held in Jakarta and Bandung from 22 to 24 April 2005, represented a historic event marking the establishment of a new strategic partnership between Asia and Africa.
The Asian-African Summit resulted in the Declaration on the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership, the Joint Ministerial Statement on the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership Plan of Action and the Joint Asian-African Leaders' Statement on Tsunamis, Earthquakes and Other Natural Disasters (see annex).
The Summit also represents a significant milestone in further strengthening South-South cooperation and serves as one of the building blocks in strengthening the United Nations multilateral system.
In view of the importance of South-South cooperation and on behalf of our Governments in our capacity as co-chairs of the Asian-African Summit, we have the honour to submit herewith the outcomes of the Summit and request that the present letter and its annex be issued as a document of the General Assembly under agenda item 90 (a).
(Signed) Rezlan Ishar Jenie Ambassador Permanent Representative of Indonesia to the United Nations
