Rules 155 and 156 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly provide as follows:
“Rule 155

“Rule 156
“The members of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, no two of whom shall be nationals of the same State, shall be selected on the basis of broad geographical representation, personal qualifications and experience and shall serve for a period of three years corresponding to three calendar years.
Members shall retire by rotation and shall be eligible for reappointment.
The three financial experts shall not retire simultaneously.
The General Assembly shall appoint the members of the Advisory Committee at the regular session immediately preceding the expiration of the term of office of the members or, in case of vacancies, at the next session.”
The present membership of the Advisory Committee is the following:
Mr. Andrzej T. Abraszewski (Poland)**
Mr. Manlan Narcisse Ahounou (Côte d'Ivoire)**
Mr. Ronald Elkhuizen (Netherlands)***
Mr. Jorge Flores Callejas (Honduras)***
Mr. Homero Luis Hernández (Dominican Republic)*
Mr. Collen V. Kelapile (Botswana)**
Mr. Jerry Kramer (Canada)***
Mr. Vladimir V. Kuznetsov (Russian Federation)*
Mr. E. Besley Maycock (Barbados)**
Mr. Thomas Mazet (Germany)*
Ms. Susan M. McLurg (United States of America)*
Mr. Rajat Saha (India)***
Mr. Murari Raj Sharma (Nepal)**
Ms. Sun Minqin (China)***
Mr. Jun Yamazaki (Japan)***
Mr. Mounir Zahran (Egypt)*
* Term of office expires on 31 December 2005.
** Term of office expires on 31 December 2006.
*** Term of office expires on 31 December 2007.
Since the terms of office of Mr. Hernández, Mr. Kuznetsov, Mr. Mazet, Ms. McLurg and Mr. Zahran will expire on 31 December 2005, it will be necessary for the General Assembly, at its sixtieth session, to appoint five persons to fill the resulting vacancies.
The persons so appointed will serve for a period of three years, beginning on 1 January 2006.
At previous sessions, the Fifth Committee submitted to the General Assembly a draft decision containing the names of the persons recommended for appointment.
It is suggested that a similar procedure be followed at the sixtieth session.
