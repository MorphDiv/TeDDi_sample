Explanatory memorandum
The protracted conflicts in the Black Sea — South Caucasus region, namely in the eastern districts of the Republic of Moldova, Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia in Georgia and the Nagorny-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan, constitute a serious threat to international peace and security, endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of three States Members of the United Nations, have resulted in loss of control over considerable parts of the territory of those sovereign States and the continued occupation of a significant part of the territory of one sovereign State, caused multi-million refugee flows and internal displacement, and hamper the economic and social development of millions of people in the region.
Regretfully, international mediation over the conflicts has yielded no results, and that has led to their prolongation.
The protracted nature of the conflicts has caused the emergence of territories that are beyond the control of the central legitimate authorities.
Those territories appear to be the primary breeding grounds for new and old security challenges like terrorism, aggressive separatism, organized crime, trafficking in human beings, drug smuggling and proliferation of small arms and light weapons.
In the Charter of the United Nations and in the Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome the Member States expressed the resolve to combine their efforts to maintain international peace and security and to that end reaffirmed their dedication to upholding the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence, and to bring about resolution of disputes by peaceful means and in conformity with principles of justice and international law.
Given the far-reaching implications of these protracted conflicts for international peace and security, regional stability and development, the Governments of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine, proceeding from the 2005 Chisinau Declaration of the GUAM Heads of State entitled “In the name of democracy, stability and development” (see A/59/796), deem it necessary for this question to be considered as a matter of priority by the General Assembly at its sixtieth session under an item entitled “Protracted conflicts in the Black Sea — South Caucasus region and their implications for international peace, security and development”, with a view to taking appropriate action to deal with this acute and pressing problem in all its aspects.
