Financing of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea
Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 and proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
Introduction
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is recommending acceptance of the proposal of the Secretary-General for the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006.
In the paragraphs below, the Committee makes a number of observations and recommendations with regard to the administration and management of the Mission, as well as opportunities for further savings.
The general report of the Advisory Committee on United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/59/736) contains its views and recommendations on a number of cross-cutting issues.
In the paragraphs below, the Committee deals with resources and other items that relate specifically to UNMEE.
The documents used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the financing of UNMEE are listed at the end of the present report.
Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004
On the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, the General Assembly, in its resolution 57/328 of 18 June 2003, appropriated to the Special Account for UNMEE an amount of $196,890,300 for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004, inclusive of $188,400,000 for the maintenance of the Mission, $6,501,300 for the support account and $1,989,000 for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy.
The appropriation reflected a reduction of $10,000,000 from the proposed initial estimate of the Secretary-General of $198,355,200 (see A/57/673).
Expenditures for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 totalled $183,600,200 gross ($179,022,900 net) (see A/59/616, sect.
III.A), reflecting a budget implementation rate of 97.5 per cent.
The resulting unencumbered balance of $4,799,800 gross ($5,544,600 net) represents, in gross terms, 2.5 per cent of the appropriation.
The unutilized balance is mostly attributable to: savings under military and police personnel ($4,920,100), owing to reduced reimbursements for contingent-owned equipment resulting from the non-provision of equipment originally included in signed memorandums of understanding, and decreased payments to one contingent for the cessation of use of its equipment; and savings under operational requirements ($5,876,100), resulting mostly from lower actual costs under revised contractual arrangements for rental and operation of helicopters and lower usage of fuel.
These elements were offset by additional requirements of $5,996,400 under civilian personnel, resulting from an actual vacancy rate much lower than that budgeted (5 per cent compared to 21 per cent), and the fact that only 105 staff were on appointments of limited duration instead of the 169 anticipated.
The relevant comments of the Advisory Committee on the information in the performance report on individual objects of expenditure can be found in the discussions of the proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 in the paragraphs below.
Information on performance for the current period
This year, owing to various constraints, rather than including standard statistical data on performance for the current period in each of the individual peacekeeping reports, it has been necessary to supply this type of information in consolidated tables, which are annexed to the general report of the Advisory Committee on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736).
The information to be provided covers the following: (a) expenditure for the current period; (b) current incumbency; (c) status of reimbursement for troop/formed police costs, contingent-owned equipment and death and disability; (d) cash position of the missions; and (e) status of contributions.
Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006
Mandate and planned results
The Advisory Committee welcomes the improvements in the results-based budget presentation for UNMEE for 2005/06.
The performance report allows, for the first time, a comparison of performance against the planned results-based frameworks that were set out in the 2003/04 budget for UNMEE.
The Committee expects that the Mission's collection of data from all components hereafter will lead to additional improvements in establishing a baseline that will facilitate better comparisons in future.
The support component of the presentation incorporates service indicators, that enable measurement of management improvements (see A/59/616 component 3, planned outputs).
There is, however, room for further enhancement, particularly in those cases in which the indicators of achievement appear to be beyond the control of the Mission or where other agencies of the system have the main responsibility and the Mission just oversees or monitors those activities.
Such constraints, if any, could be reflected in the external factors.
The Committee also believes that the human resources element of components should be further refined in order to avoid repetition of outputs.
The Advisory Committee notes that the overall objective of the Mission has been reformulated on the basis of the specific mandate of the Mission, as “the peaceful settlement of the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea” (A/59/636, para.
The Committee recalls that in paragraph 46 of its report on administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations to the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly (A/57/772) it had indicated that any attempt to define mandate objectives must be in strict compliance with the mandates established by the Security Council.
The Committee was informed that this reformulation had been made on the basis of UNMEE's mandate, as contained in Security Council resolution 1320 (2000).
The budget presentation for 2005/06 in the report on the proposed budget of the Mission (A/59/636) reflects the revised concept of operations ensuing from the two phased adjustments indicated by the Secretary-General in his report to the Security Council (S/2004/708, paras.
13-18) and approved by the Security Council in its resolution 1560 (2004).
The phased adjustment of the Mission was proposed after completion of a review of UNMEE's effectiveness carried out in March 2004, in which various options were considered to streamline and adjust the Mission's operations, taking into consideration the security dynamics throughout the Mission, as well as the need not to undermine its core monitoring function or the prospect of the Boundary Commission resuming its work (see para.
13 below).
The Committee is of the opinion that a short narrative indicating the impact of important changes in the planned results should have been included in section I of the Secretary-General's budget report (A/59/636).
The Advisory Committee also notes from the recent report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council (S/2005/142, para.
11) that the core operations, under the revised concept, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1320 (2000), remain “observation, reporting, analysis, identification of potential flash points and preventive action.
The concept also includes selective aerial reconnaissance of particular areas”.
Resource requirements
Military and police personnel
a Represents highest level of authorized strength.
In line with the reconfiguration of the Mission indicated in paragraph 11 above, and in the context of phase I of the adjustments, the Slovak military demining contingent was replaced, after its departure in June 2004, with the contracted services of a small commercial company (see para.
41 below).
In his report to the Security Council, the Secretary-General indicated that it will result in savings of some $6 million annually (S/2004/708, para.
The memorandum of understanding signed by the United Nations Mine Action Service and the United Nations Office for Project Services was amended accordingly (S/2004/973, para.
Phase II of the adjustments entailed the repatriation of the infantry battalion and support elements from Sector East and the consolidation of the existing three sectors into two sectors, thus leading to the downsizing of the UNMEE force headquarters.
In his report to the Security Council, the Secretary-General indicated that the annual savings in troop costs may amount to some $20 million annually, including savings for logistic support (S/2004/708, para.
The provision proposed for military and police personnel for the period from 30 June 2005 to 31 July 2006 amounts to $79,597,700.
The $17,952,700 decrease (18.4 per cent), compared to the apportionment for 2004/05, reflects the reduction in strength of contingent personnel from 3,980 in the current period to a projected strength of 3,184 for 2005/06, in accordance with the implementation of the adjustments approved by the Security Council in its resolution 1560 (2004).
The estimated requirements for contingent-owned equipment for 2005/06 amount to $14,104,800, reflecting a decrease of $6,594,800 compared to the 2004/05 apportionment, taking into account signed memorandums of understanding and the decreased level of planned contingent personnel.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes that savings of $2,383,100 are reported for the performance period 2003/04 under this budget item, compared to the estimated apportionment of $22,192,000.
The under expenditures resulted from the non-provision of equipment originally included in the memorandums of understanding, lower requirements for reimbursement to one contingent due to the cessation of use of its equipment (see para.
13 above), and lower reimbursement to the majority of contingents due to the provision of United Nations accommodation units effective January 2004 (see para.
22 below).
Information on support provided to contingents by the Mission for the 2003/04 period, provided upon enquiry, is attached to the report.
The Advisory Committee reiterates its request that this information should be included in future budget documents (A/58/759/Add.8, para.
The Advisory Committee noted that additional expenses of $170,000 were incurred during the performance period 2003/04 as a result of higher average rotation costs per military observer ($4,492 compared to $4,100 budgeted).
The Committee was further informed that four Member States rotated their military observers up to three times per year.
However, no additional costs were incurred by UNMEE for these additional rotations.
Civilian personnel
a Representing highest level of authorized/proposed strength.
b Includes National Officers and national General Service staff.
Recommendation on posts
In view of the completion of phase II of the drawdown of the military component of the Mission, mentioned in paragraph 11 above, the level of civilian staff has been reassessed.
The Advisory Committee was informed that UNMEE had established a downsizing committee to review the staffing situation in relation to the existing workload in order to rearrange and distribute the workload among the various components.
As a result, a 10 per cent reduction of 61 posts is proposed for 2005/06, including 26 international posts (12 Professional, 9 Field Service and 5 General Service), 27 national posts and posts for 8 United Nations Volunteers.
In addition, the post of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, in Addis Ababa, is proposed to be reclassified from the Assistant Secretary-General level to the D-2 level, in view of the current status of the peace process and the relatively small size of the office in that location.
The Committee welcomes this initiative and recommends acceptance of these staffing proposals.
Other observations and recommendations
The related civilian personnel costs for UNMEE reflect an increase of $961,200 (3 per cent), compared to the apportionment of $31,757,100 for 2004/05.
The proposed staff costs take into account: (a) the reduction in posts mentioned above; (b) the application of a 5 per cent vacancy rate for international, national staff and United Nations Volunteers' posts, compared to a rate of 10 per cent for international staff and a rate of 2 per cent for national and United Nations Volunteers' staff applied in 2004/05; and (c) the application of the new standard cost parameters based on an average actual cost for salaries by grade level by peacekeeping mission.
For UNMEE, common staff costs for international staff are calculated on the basis of 55 per cent of net salaries and 31 per cent of net salaries for national staff.
In its report (A/58/759/Add.8, para.
30), the Advisory Committee commended UNMEE for the progress made in lowering vacancy rates for international civilian personnel for the period 2002/03.
Moreover, as noted in paragraph 5 above, vacancy rates for the period 2003/04 averaged 5 per cent compared to the 21 per cent budgeted for the period.
However, at the time of its hearings, in March 2005, the Committee was informed that the current vacancy rate for international staff at UNMEE was 22 per cent, owing to the high turnover of staff as a result of the start-up of new peacekeeping missions and expansion of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC).
Although the Committee is of the opinion that it is good for experienced staff to be mobile and to be available to meet the requirements of new missions, the situation should be monitored in order to avoid disruption in the Mission's activities.
Measures should be taken to find ways to retain required experienced staff.
Operational costs
The estimated operational costs for UNMEE for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 are proposed at $64,400,200, reflecting a decrease of $4,623,900 or 6.7 per cent, compared to the apportionment for 2004/05.
The main factors contributing to the variance are decreased requirements under facilities and infrastructure, communications, information technology and medical costs in view of the reductions in troop strength.
Facilities and infrastructure
The decrease of $5,344,100 in the proposed requirements under this item (compared to the apportionment of $21,335,300 for 2004/05) is mostly due to a decrease of $2,244,100 in requirements for reimbursement to troop-contributing countries for self-sustainment, since the provision of hardwall accommodations to all contingents is expected to be completed by June 2005.
Requirements for construction services also decreased by $1,262,000 as the major project for maintenance of main supply routes used by UNMEE is to be finalized during the current period.
The proposed resources under acquisition of prefabricated facilities amount to $51,800, compared to the apportionment of $532,000 for 2004/05.
The Advisory Committee notes, however, that non-budgeted expenditures of $2,265,300 were incurred during the performance period 2003/04 under facilities and infrastructure for the immediate procurement of prefabricated structures, some in order to satisfy the unexpected request from one contingent for United Nations hardwall accommodations.
In its report on the financing of UNMEE for 2004/05, the Advisory Committee indicated that, in view of the fact that the headquarters in Asmara had been assessed as particularly vulnerable, efforts had begun to identify a more security-suitable option.
An additional appropriation of $7 million was approved for this purpose in the context of the Secretary-General's report on strengthening the security of United Nations staff and premises.
The Committee was informed that UNMEE and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations have requested the Government of Eritrea to assist the Mission in the identification of an alternative location but that thus far the search has been without success.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the Secretary-General sent a letter to the President of Eritrea on 5 November 2004, in which he raised three issues of particular importance relating to UNMEE's daily operations, for which no response had been received as at the time of the Committee's hearings on the financing of the Mission (March 2005).
The issues include: (a) direct flights between Asmara and Addis Ababa, (b) cooperation to find alternative premises for UNMEE headquarters for security reasons and (c) the reopening of the road from Asmara to Keren, via Barentu.
Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was further informed that UNMEE has incurred expenditures of $4.2 million for the period from 23 August 2000 to 28 February 2005 as a result of having to operate indirect flights between Asmara and Addis Ababa (see also para.
34 below).
The fact that the road from Asmara to Keren (via Barentu), the best road for supplying the Mission troops in Sector West, still remains closed to UNMEE traffic is also a major impediment to the Mission's operations.
The cost of operating the indirect route for the period from February 2004 to March 2005 amounts to $143,584, while costs associated with the direct route would amount to $63,324 (a difference of $80,260).
The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that these operational impediments, which have serious financial and security implications for the everyday functioning of the Mission, should continue to be addressed at the highest level (see Security Council resolution 1586 (2005), paras.
3 and 4).
The Advisory Committee was informed during its hearings that the staff officers' camp, which provides accommodation for 85 staff officers and support elements, a level I and II clinic and hospital, the Mission's training centre, the Aeromed Casevac Unit, UNMEE's alternative operation centre, an engineering workshop and the Mission's communications centre and is located on land belonging to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other agencies, will need to be relocated by November 2005.
In February 2005, UNDP informed the Mission, by letter, that it will start construction of a consolidated headquarters common premises for the United Nations in Eritrea.
The Advisory Committee was informed at the time that, in view of the difficulties of relocating, additional provision would have to be made for standard troop cost reimbursements and mission subsistence allowance in connection with the displacement of the staff officers.
However, upon enquiry, additional information provided to the Committee indicated that, following an internal review, the Mission has decided to minimize the costs involved by constructing the needed accommodation and enhancing the communications network at the site of its logistics base.
The total costs involved are estimated at $1,624,400, of which an amount of $1,233,400 relates to the cost of constructing the needed accommodation and an amount of $391,000 to the enhancement of the communications network in order to provide service to the new accommodations and support elements for the staff officers and the level I and II hospitals.
The Advisory Committee was informed that UNMEE had reviewed the proposed budget for 2005/06 and was able to identify an amount of $899,300 that could be redeployed to cover the costs of constructing the new accommodations for the staff officers.
The net increase of $725,100, required for the construction and related communications needs at the site of the logistics base, is proposed to be absorbed within the proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, as contained in the report of the Secretary-General (A/59/636).
The following table summarizes the proposal (in United States dollars):
Any overexpenditure would be reported in the performance report for the same period.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this proposal.
Air transportation
Savings of $4,537,600 are reported for the 2003/04 performance period under this budget item (compared to the approved amount of $20,715,000).
This is mostly due to lower costs under revised contractual arrangements for rental and operation of helicopters and lower than anticipated usage of fuel.
For the 2005/06 period, the resources proposed in the budget report (A/59/636) amount to $22,461,000 (a decrease of $1,058,100 compared to the 2004/05 apportionment).
Although the air fleet has been reconfigured, and the use of the IL-76-C aircraft has been discontinued, most of the variance relates to higher costs for the rental of helicopters (an increase of $3,707,500).
The Advisory Committee notes that use of the executive jet (HS-125) is also to be discontinued in the proposals contained in the budget report (A/59/636, para.
The Advisory Committee was, however, informed that UNMEE was proposing to reinstate the use of the executive jet for the 2005/06 period in order to provide the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Force Commander with adequate support to sustain their efforts on behalf of the peace process, taking into account the fact that direct flights between Asmara and Addis Ababa are still not possible.
The aircraft would also be used in case of urgent need for evacuation for medical purposes, should the need arise.
The operating cost is estimated at $3,525,900 annually, or $293,825 on a monthly basis.
This amount was not included in the reconfigured estimates for 2005/06 mentioned in paragraphs 29 and 30 above, but the Committee was informed that the Mission will attempt to accommodate its air operations requirements within the proposed level of resources.
The Advisory Committee notes that the discontinuation of the executive jet was predicated on the anticipated approval of direct flights between Asmara and Addis Ababa (see para.
31 above).
Since the approval has not materialized, the Committee does not object to the continued use of the jet for the time being.
The Committee trusts however, that the use of the air assets of the Mission will be closely monitored.
Moreover, United Nations air assets available in the region might be reconfigured to accommodate the needs of UNMEE.
The provision for landing fees proposed for 2005/06 is $868,900 (compared to the apportionment for 2004/05 of $1,200,900 and reported expenditures of $782,200 for 2003/04).
The Advisory Committee notes that the financial implications of the payment of fees for airport services to Eritrea and Ethiopia resulting from the lack of a status-of-forces agreement with the host Governments amounts to $1,924,140 and $194,261, respectively, for the period from 23 August 2000 to 28 February 2005.
The Committee was informed that this will be included in the report on non-compliance with provisions of status-of-forces agreements prepared for submission to the General Assembly.
In line with the review mentioned in paragraph 29 above, and indicated in the table in paragraph 30, the resources for air transportation shown in the budget report (A/59/636) were decreased by $591,300 as a result of a reduction of $572,000 in liability insurance for both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft and $19,300 for air crew subsistence allowance.
The resources will be used to cover the requirements for the construction of accommodations and the provision of communications referred to in paragraph 28 above.
Ground transportation
The requirements for ground transportation of $6,095,000 for 2005/06 (see A/59/636, sect.
II.A) have been revised and decreased by $221,300 to $5,873,700.
The number of light vehicles proposed for acquisition has been reduced by 10 to reflect the downsizing in the number of staff officers and support personnel and to provide for the redeployment of funds in order to cover the cost of construction of accommodation mentioned in paragraphs 27 to 29 above.
The Advisory Committee was informed that the ground fuel problems faced by the Mission had abated.
Moreover, as indicated in the recent report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council (S/2005/142), mission fuel reserves are now at acceptable levels and travel restrictions have been lifted.
Furthermore, UNMEE does not envisage the need to import fuel directly, as initially planned.
Training
Total training requirements for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 amount to $379,000 ($200,000 travel related and $179,000 for training fees, supplies and services), compared to an amount of $507,200 apportioned for this purpose for 2004/05.
The decrease in requirements relates to the reduced level of staffing and the Mission's intention to provide more in-house training.
The Advisory Committee was informed that training was also provided to 246 national staff covering, inter alia, languages and electrical, mechanical, movement control skills.
The Committee welcomes these initiatives, in particular the greater use of in-house training.
Communications and information technology
The resources proposed for communications and information technology in the Secretary-General's report (see A/59/636, sect.
II.A) amount to $5,685,300 and $1,476,900, respectively, reflecting reductions of $1,500,400 and $870,200, taking into account the reduction in the number of staff.
However, as indicated in paragraph 28 above, the requirements for communications have been revised to $6,071,000, reflecting an increase of $387,700, in order to provide for the additional equipment related to the relocation of the staff officers accommodations and support, as well as the relocation of the level I and II hospitals to the logistics base.
The Advisory Committee requested additional information as to the resources related to information technology, taking into account the downsizing exercise.
The Committee was informed that the Mission had decided to reduce planned acquisitions in 2004/05 by 470 units, resulting in savings of $454,800.
The Committee is of the opinion that additional savings may be achieved in connection with information technology requirements as the quantity of equipment that the Mission had planned to purchase is further adjusted, taking into account the continuing downsizing exercise.
Mine action
The mine detection and mine clearing costs included in UNMEE's budget for 2005/06 amount to $6,969,400 (A/59/636).
Of this total, an amount of $6,839,000 is for the demining activities (including $3,239,000 for the Mine Action Coordination Centre component and $3,600,000 for the services of a commercial contractor), under a revised memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Office for Project Services following the departure of the Slovak contingent; also included are expenditures of $100,000 related to supplies and $30,400 related to special equipment.
In line with the reductions mentioned in paragraphs 29 and 30 above, the resources under special equipment have been revised to $20,300.
As for the $6 million in savings mentioned in paragraph 13 above, the Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the costs per year of the Slovak demining had amounted to $9,881,308, compared to the $3,600,000 related to the new contractor.
The Committee notes that the savings have been accrued during the current 2004/05 period and will be reported in the related performance report for the period.
Other comments and observations
The Advisory Committee was provided with information regarding support provided by UNMEE to United Nations and non-United Nations entities for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004.
The Committee is of the opinion that uniform procedures regarding reimbursement from partners should be established.
In the meantime, the Mission should exercise prudence and monitor the costs.
The Advisory Committee notes there is no information on quick impact projects in the budget document.
Projects continue to be implemented from funds received through the Trust Fund for the Support of the Peace Process in Ethiopia and Eritrea in coordination with UNMEE's humanitarian partners and bilateral donors.
The Committee was informed that from January 2001 to 31 December 2004, with the engagement of 50 implementing partners, the Mission had spent $1,064,616 on 124 projects in areas of assistance related to health, sanitation, water, education and electricity.
The Committee recalls that the humanitarian and confidence-building activities of UNMEE started in early 2001 with the inclusion of $700,000 in UNMEE's budget, in line with the recommendation of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, towards quick impact projects.
In addition to this grant, bilateral donations as at 31 December 2004 amounted to $1,249,116.
Conclusion
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNMEE for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 is indicated in paragraph 19 of the performance report (A/59/616).
The Advisory Committee recommends that the unencumbered balance of $4,799,800, as well as other income and adjustments in the amount of $15,384,700, be credited to Member States in a manner to be determined by the General Assembly.
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNMEE for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 is indicated in paragraph 22 of the proposed budget (A/59/636).
In view of its comments in the present report, the Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the Secretary-General's proposal for the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.
