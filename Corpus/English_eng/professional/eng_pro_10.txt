By way of derogation from Article 28(3), central banks of Member States with a derogation shall not pay up their subscribed capital unless the General Council, acting by a majority representing at least two thirds of the subscribed capital of the European Central Bank and at least half of the shareholders, decides that a minimal percentage has to be paid up as a contribution to the operational costs of the European Central Bank.
Article 48
Deferred payment of capital, reserves and provisions of the European Central Bank
1.
The central bank of a Member State whose derogation has been abrogated shall pay up its subscribed share of the capital of the European Central Bank to the same extent as the central banks of other Member States whose currency is the euro, and shall transfer to the European Central Bank foreign reserve assets in accordance with Article 30(1).
The sum to be transferred shall be determined by multiplying the euro value at current exchange rates of the foreign reserve assets which have already been transferred to the European Central Bank in accordance with Article 30(1), by the ratio between the number of shares subscribed by the national central bank concerned and the number of shares already paid up by the other national central banks.2.
In addition to the payment to be made in accordance with paragraph 1, the national central bank concerned shall contribute to the reserves of the European Central Bank, to those provisions equivalent to reserves, and to the amount still to be appropriated to the reserves and provisions corresponding to the balance of the profit and loss account as at 31 December of the year prior to the abrogation of the derogation.
The sum to be contributed shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the reserves, as defined above and as stated in the approved balance sheet of the European Central Bank, by the ratio between the number of shares subscribed by the central bank concerned and the number of shares already paid up by the other central banks.3.
Upon one or more countries becoming Member States and their respective national central banks becoming part of the European System of Central Banks, the subscribed capital of the European Central Bank and the limit on the amount of foreign reserve assets that may be transferred to the European Central Bank shall be automatically increased.
The increase shall be determined by multiplying the respective amounts then prevailing by the ratio, within the expanded capital key, between the weighting of the entering national central banks concerned and the weighting of the national central banks already members of the European System of Central Banks.
Each national central bank's weighting in the capital key shall be calculated by analogy with Article 29(1) and in compliance with Article 29(2).
