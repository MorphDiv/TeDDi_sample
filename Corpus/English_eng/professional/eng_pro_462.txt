Note by the Secretary-General
The report of the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization covering the year 2004 is submitted herewith to the General Assembly pursuant to the provisions of article IV, paragraph 1, of the Agreement to Regulate the Relationship between the United Nations and the Preparatory Commission (General Assembly resolution 54/280, annex).
The Executive Secretary will report on the recent activities of the Commission in his statement before the First Committee of the General Assembly.
Since only a limited number of copies of the report are available, it has not been possible to make a full distribution.
Delegations are therefore requested to have the copies transmitted to them available during discussion of this item.
