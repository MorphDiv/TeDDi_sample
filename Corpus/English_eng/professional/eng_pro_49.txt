African Ministers' Council on Water
Addis Ababa, 29-- and 30 June 2005
Agenda item 6 (c)
Implications of major global developments and processes:
Special Meetingmeeting of the UN General Assembly on the 5-year
review of the Millennium Declaration (September 2005) - AMCOW's
input by the African Heads of State and Government
Special meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the five-year review of the implementation of the Millennium Declaration
Note by the secretariat
In paragraph 75 of its resolution 57/270 B of 23 June , the General Assembly stressed that there was scope for a major event in 2005, possibly a comprehensive review, bearing in mind that it had decided to review in 2005 the progress achieved in implementing all the commitments made in the Millennium Declaration on the basis of a comprehensive report of the United Nations Secretary--General.
In its resolution 58/291 of 6 May , the General Assembly decided to convene in 2005, at the commencement of its sixtieth session, a high-level plenary meeting of the Assembly with the participation of Heads of State and Government.
This major event, to be held in New York from 14 to 16 September 2005, is expected to undertake a comprehensive review of the progress made in the fulfilment of all the commitments contained in the Millennium Declaration, including the internationally-agreed development goals and the global partnership required for their achievement and in the integrated and coordinated implementation, at the national, regional and international levels, of the outcomes and commitments of the major United Nations conferences and summits in areas related to economic and social issues.
The contribution of the African Ministers' Council on Water to the thirteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development contains sections relevant to the special summit of the General Assembly on the review of the five-year implementation of the Millennium Declaration.
The President of the General Assembly, in preparation for the above-mentioned meeting, met with government delegations in New York on 3 June 2005 and with delegations preparing for the high-level plenary meeting and presented a draft document on the outcomes.
The document was tabled after the four working groups of facilitators had examined different parts of the report of the United Nations Secretary-General entitled “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all”.
The President of the General Assembly indicated that he would wish to reconvene informal consultations on the document on 21 June.
He expressed the view that the draft document on the outcomes, which he had tabled in New York on 3 June, could provide the basis for the outcome of the high-level plenary meeting (for the five-year review of the Millennium Declaration).
In order to facilitate our discussions on the subject, the Technical Advisory Committee of the African Ministers' Council on Water has submitted, for our consideration, a note containing specific proposals which can form the basis for the inputs of the African Ministers' Council on Water.
Suggested action
Consideration, forThe Executive Committee might wish to consider, with a view to their possible approval, of the inputs developed by the Technical Advisory Committee of the African Ministers' Council on Water.
