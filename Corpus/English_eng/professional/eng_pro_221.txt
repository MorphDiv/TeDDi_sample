Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Financing of the United Nations Operation in Burundi
Expenditure report for the period from 21 April to 30 June 2004 and proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 of the United Nations Operation in Burundi
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
Introduction
The recommendations and observations of the Advisory Committee in paragraphs 24 and 25 below, and in those paragraphs listed in paragraph 41, indicate a reduction, from $296,654,700 to $292,347,600 gross ($284,050,500 net), to the proposed budget for the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006.
The Committee also makes several observations and recommendations regarding the administration and management of the Operation and opportunities for further savings.
The Advisory Committee's general report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/59/736) contains its views and recommendations on cross-cutting issues.
The Committee therefore deals in the paragraphs below with resources and other items specifically relating to ONUB.
The documents used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the financing of ONUB are listed at the end of the present report.
Expenditure report for the period from 21 April to 30 June 2004
On the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, the General Assembly, by its resolution 58/312 of 18 June 2004, authorized a financial commitment not exceeding $156,043,900 for the period from 21 April to 31 October 2004, including the amount of $49,709,300 gross ($49,559,900 net) for the period from 21 April to 30 June 2004 for the establishment of ONUB.
The latter amount included $49,491,200 previously authorized by the Advisory Committee.
The total amount has been assessed on Member States.
Expenditure for the period from 21 April to 30 June 2004 totalled $40,246,100 gross ($40,130,600 net), which is $9,463,300 gross ($9,429,400 net) or 19 per cent lower than the appropriation of $49,709,300 gross ($49,559,900 net).
The unutilized balance of $9,463,300 resulted from mission start-up operations from 21 April to 30 June 2004.
The Advisory Committee noted that the Secretariat submitted an expenditure report for that period rather than a financial performance report.
The Committee was informed that this was due to the fact that ONUB was operational for only approximately two months before the start of the 2004/05 budget period.
While individual budget line items were broken down by object code in the supplementary information, variances or explanations were not included.
The Committee recognizes the overall savings of $9,463,300 gross achieved by ONUB for the period from 21 April to 30 June 2004.
Information on performance for the current period
Rather than including standard statistical data on performance for the current period in each of the individual peacekeeping reports, this time, owing to various constraints, it has been necessary to supply that information in consolidated tables which are annexed to the Advisory Committee's general report on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736).
The information to be provided covers the following: (a) expenditure for the current period; (b) current incumbency; (c) status of reimbursement for troop/formed police unit costs, contingent-owned equipment and death and disability; (d) cash position of the missions; and (e) status of contributions.
Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006
General
The Advisory Committee notes with satisfaction that, in response to observations in the Committee's last report (A/59/412, para.
6), ONUB has presented its budget in a user-friendly format, with clear and concise language.
In particular, the Committee acknowledges the effective use of quantitative and qualitative performance indicators to measure the Mission's achieved and planned outputs.
The Committee trusts that the mission's efforts in this respect will continue and that its results-based budgeting presentation will be further refined.
In its last report on ONUB, the Advisory Committee discussed the application of a model organizational structure with certain commonalities for current and future missions (A/59/412, paras.
These would be utilized mainly at the start-up phase of new missions and adjusted on the basis of experience.
The Committee made a number of recommendations on the ONUB staffing establishment (ibid., para.
It appears, however, that those recommendations have not been fully implemented.
The Committee has been informed that there is an ongoing analysis in ONUB based on the Committee's recommendations.
The Committee notes with concern a concentration of functions, leading to organizational top-heaviness, in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
ONUB explained that it operates in a hierarchy-conscious political and military environment where higher-level mission staff can more effectively initiate and pursue contacts with counterparts in Burundi and abroad.
The Committee nonetheless urges ONUB to reassess its staffing levels in this respect.
The Committee once more cautions against the replication of functions to the detriment of overall operational efficiency, accountability and cost-effectiveness (see A/59/412, para.
The Committee notes that the ONUB staffing table includes separate posts for information analysis, Strategic Planning Officer and Best Practices Officer.
The individual posts are discussed in detail in paragraphs 30 and 31 below.
The Committee believes that information analysis, strategic planning and best practices functions are important tasks but is not convinced that separate units or fully dedicated staff are operationally required in this respect.
The Committee points out that capacities in this respect already exist at Headquarters, and expects an integrative approach and effective collaboration between Headquarters and the field to avoid duplicative efforts.
The Committee urges a review aimed at furthering integration and collaboration and avoiding the proliferation of units.
The Committee comments further on this in its general report.
The Committee was informed that, while the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process was progressing well, it was slightly behind schedule except for the integration of ex-combatants into the new army.
Moreover, assistance from ONUB was required for infrastructural tasks such as the construction or renovation of shelters, access roads and water supplies for ex-combatants' camps.
The Committee noted that 39 quick-impact projects are ongoing and that 8 had been completed at a total cost of $533,000.
The ONUB programme review committee allocates quick-impact projects by region by prioritizing needs according to such factors as weaknesses in infrastructure, schools, orphanages, or water wells.
The Committee recalls that the authority for quick-impact projects delegated by the Controller has been increased from $15,000 to $25,000.
The Advisory Committee is pleased to note the close political, military and logistics cooperation between ONUB and MONUC, with regular inter-mission meetings.
The two missions share responsibility for security along the border between Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, moreover, have established close cooperation on Medevac and safety matters.
Resource requirements
Military and civilian police personnel
a As at 31 March 2005.
Cost estimates for military observers for the period 2005/06 total $10,052,600, an increase of $995,400 as compared to the 2004/05 apportionment of $9,057,200.
The proposed increase is due to a combination of projected full deployment and a higher number of expected rotations; however, the strength of military observers remains at 200.
The troop strength of ONUB remains unchanged at 5,450, including 125 military staff officers.
Cost estimates for military contingents for 2005/06 total $127,560,100, a decrease of $1,844,800 from the previous budget period apportionment of $129,404,900.
Supplementary information submitted indicates that one of the main factors for the proposed decrease results from reduced requirements for the freight of contingent-owned equipment deployed during the 2004/05 period.
The Committee notes that an amount of $5,497,800 is proposed for mission subsistence allowance for 125 staff officers at approved rates of $156 for the first 30 days and $120 thereafter.
The Committee was informed that mission subsistence allowance is paid directly to the 125 ONUB staff officers for their living expenses, that is, accommodation, food and other needs.
The Committee was also informed that, in addition to the mission subsistence allowance payments made directly to the staff officers, reimbursement is made to those countries providing the officers at the standard reimbursement rate of $1,028 per officer per month, plus a specialist allowance at $73 per officer per month for clothing and equipment.
The Advisory Committee points out that the conditions of service for staff officers stipulate that missions are normally expected to provide acceptable accommodation to staff officers within 12 months.
The Committee understands that ONUB has conducted a review to ascertain the cost-benefits of accommodating the staff officers in mission-provided facilities versus paying them mission subsistence allowance.
ONUB concluded that, in view of the additional costs related to the construction of facilities for staff officers and the anticipated limited duration of the mission, it might not be cost-efficient and practical to construct staff officers' facilities only to abandon them shortly afterwards during mission liquidation.
The Committee notes that other missions also pay mission subsistence allowance to staff officers.
In those cases, however, efforts are made to phase out the payment of mission subsistence allowance.
The Committee was informed that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had formed a working group to conduct a review of this matter in all missions.
The Advisory Committee looks forward to the working group's results.
The Committee is of the opinion that a uniform policy should be adopted with exceptions only in clearly delineated and justified cases.
Civilian personnel
The Committee acknowledges the efforts made to decrease the vacancy rates in ONUB during 2004/05.
In its previous report, the Committee recommended that ONUB undertake efforts to adjust its delayed deployment factors (A/59/412, para.
The table provides a comparison:
a As at 31 March 2005.
The Committee commends ONUB for significantly decreasing its vacancy rates within a five-month time period.
The Committee, in particular, notes the decrease of national staff vacancy rates from 64.5 per cent (as at 28 September 2004; see A/59/412, para.
15) to 14.2 per cent (as at 31 March 2005).
The Advisory Committee trusts that the mission will continue to monitor its civilian staff vacancy rates.
The Committee recommends a particular emphasis on further reducing the vacancy rate for United Nations Volunteers, which now stands at 18.7 per cent.
Recommendations on posts
In its resolution 59/15 of 29 October 2004, the General Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to fill a number of posts in ONUB, at appropriate grades, until 30 June 2005.
The Secretary-General was requested to rejustify those posts in his next budget with additional information on appropriate grades.
The rejustifications are discussed in paragraphs 21 to 29 below.
Rejustification of the D-1-level post of Director of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
The Advisory Committee accepts the reasons given in the Secretary-General's report for the rejustification of the post at the D-1 level.
Rejustification of the P-4 post of Political Affairs Officer in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
10 (c)).
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the rejustification in view of the importance of the post to the functioning of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
Rejustification of the post of Protocol Officer in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General: establishment of one post of Protocol Officer at the National Officer level and redeployment of the authorized P-3 Protocol Officer post to the joint mission analysis cell (A/59/748, para.
10 (d)).
The Committee refers to its recommendations (A/59/412, para.
21): it does not see the need for a Protocol Officer at the P-3 level, whose functions should be absorbed by other staff of the Office.
The Committee recommends approval of the redeployment of the P-3 post to the joint mission analysis cell as an Information Analyst post.
In addition, the Committee supports the establishment of a National Officer post of Protocol Officer, which would be consistent with its recommendations to hire national staff whenever operationally possible and practical.
Rejustification of the P-4 post of Political Affairs Officer in the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
The Committee refers to its recommendation (A/59/412, para.
21) that this post should be abolished to avoid duplication of functions.
The Advisory Committee was not provided with new or convincing information.
Therefore, the Committee maintains the position expressed in its recommendation (see A/59/412) that the P-4 Political Affairs Officer post in the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General be abolished.
Rejustification of a post of Administrative Assistant (General Service) in the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
12 (b)).
The Committee refers to its recommendation (A/59/412, para.
21) that this post should be abolished to avoid duplication of functions.
The Advisory Committee was not provided with new or convincing information.
Therefore, the Committee maintains the position expressed in its recommendation (see A/59/412) that the post of Administrative Assistant in the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General be abolished.
Rejustification of the post of Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the Assistant Secretary-General level (A/59/748, para.
The function of this post is humanitarian and development coordination.
The Committee recalls its previous view that this post should normally be established at the D-2 level; moreover, as indicated in paragraph 22 of the Committee's previous report on MINUSTAH (A/59/390), it was the understanding of the Committee that this post would usually be funded by UNDP up to the grade level of the existing Resident Coordinator; any difference between D-2 and Assistant Secretary-General would be paid by the mission concerned.
This arrangement has as yet not been put into effect.
Given the role of this position, the Committee sees no reason why the arrangements discussed with UNDP would not be applied to all missions concerned, irrespective of what level is eventually determined for this post.
It expects that an undertaking that UNDP would fund the post up to the D-2 level will be confirmed and put into practice without further delay, and it requests that it be informed accordingly before the submission of the 2006/07 budget.
The Committee also discusses this matter in its general report (A/59/736).
On the basis of a further elaboration of the responsibilities of this post, the Committee accepts the reasons given for a rejustification of this post at the Assistant Secretary-General level.
Rejustification of the P-4 post of Special Assistant to the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
15 (b)).
ONUB indicates in its proposed budget that following the redeployment of the P-5 Senior Liaison Officer post to Head of the joint mission analysis cell (see para.
30 below), the functions of the P-5 Senior Liaison Officer will be assumed by the Special Assistant.
The Advisory Committee accepts the reasons given in the Secretary-General's report for the rejustification of the P-4 post.
Rejustification and establishment of the post of P-5 Senior Legal Adviser in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
10 (b)).
The Committee refers to its recommendation (A/59/412, para.
21) that the Office of the Legal Adviser should be headed at the P-5 instead of the D-1 level, in view of available support from Headquarters.
The Committee recommended that the D-1 post should be downgraded to the P-5 level.
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of this request, which is consistent with the Committee's previously stated position.
Rejustification of the D-1 post of Chief of the Communications and Public Information Office (A/59/748, para.
12 (c)); and rejustification of the P-4 post of Spokesperson, Communications and Public Information Office (A/59/748, para.
12 (d)).
The responsibilities and scope of activities for these two functions are described in detail in the rejustification presented for the posts.
Under the circumstances, the Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of both posts at the levels proposed.
Redeployment to the joint mission analysis cell of one P-5 Senior Liaison Officer post from the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and one P-3 ex-Protocol Officer from the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
The Committee notes that the establishment of a joint mission analysis cell was discussed during 2004, specifically for MONUC.
ONUB is proposing to establish a cell for the gathering and analysis of cross-cutting information affecting mission operations, such as civilian, military, political, humanitarian and electoral, and to act as a strategic information hub for operational planning.
According to the information provided, the joint mission analysis cell concept aims at producing improved civilian and military operations by effective intelligence-gathering and analysis.
This would also include cooperation with the newly created Department of Safety and Security which would be able to utilize information gathered by the cell.
However, the Committee was informed that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has not yet formulated a policy on the establishment of joint mission analysis cells.
The Advisory Committee trusts that the policy being developed by the Department will clarify how functions of a joint mission analysis cell can, for example, be coordinated with strategic planning and best practices functions and whether information gathering, sharing and analysis between the civilian and military components of the mission require the establishment of a separate unit.
So as not to impede the progress of the mission, the Committee will not object to the proposed redeployment on the understanding that these posts will be used flexibly and that the existence of the unit will be re-evaluated in the light of such policy as the Department of Peacekeeping Operations may propose, taking into account, inter alia, experience already gained.
The following reclassification and redeployments are proposed for the Code of Conduct Officer, the Strategic Planning Officer and the Best Practices Officer:
(a) Reclassification of one P-4 post of Code of Conduct Officer to the P-5 level, in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
11 (b));
(b) Redeployment of one P-5 Senior Political Affairs Officer post from the Political Affairs Office to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, to encompass the functions of Strategic Planning Officer (A/59/748, para.
11 (c));
The Advisory Committee was informed that the core tasks of the Strategic Planning Officer are (i) coordinating the internal and external partners of ONUB with a view to ensuring successful elections; (ii) managing related multifaceted timetables with internal and external partners; and (iii) addressing broader mission management issues and formulating related strategies and solutions;
(c) Redeployment of one P-4 Best Practices Officer post from the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
11 (c)).
The Committee was informed that the Best Practices Officer will coordinate her/his work with counterparts at Headquarters to establish a regular information exchange.
The Committee will not interpose an objection to the above-mentioned proposals of the Secretary-General at this time.
However, it expects the observations it has made in paragraph 10 above to be taken into account when preparing the next budget submission.
Reclassification from P-4 to P-5 of the post of Deputy to the Head of the Political Affairs Office (A/59/748, para.
13 (b)).
The Committee notes the evolving political situation and the importance of this function; taking into account the Committee's frequently stated position that it will not, as a rule, question proposed reclassifications to P-5 and below, the Committee recommends acceptance of the Secretary-General's report.
Establishment of one P-4 post of Land Reform Officer and seven United Nations Volunteer positions (one Land Reform Assistant, one Civil Service Reform Assistant and five Civil Affairs Officers) in the Rule of Law and Civil Affairs Office (A/59/748, para.
13 (d)).
The Advisory Committee recommends the establishment of a P-4 post and seven United Nations Volunteers positions for the reasons given in the Secretary-General's report.
With regard to land reform activities, the Committee recommends that ONUB seek the assistance and advice of specialized agencies and other technical advice.
The Secretary-General proposes the establishment of a Property Management Section, comprising three units, within Integrated Support Services in the Division of Administration (A/59/748, para.
18 (d)).
The number of proposed staff for the Section would total 23: 20 redeployed and 3 newly proposed posts, as follows:
(a) Staffing for the Property Control and Inventory Unit is proposed by redeployment from the General Services Section of 10 posts (four international staff, two United Nations Volunteers and four national General Service staff);
(b) Staffing for the Contingent-owned Equipment Verification Unit (four international and six United Nations Volunteers) is proposed by redeploying 10 posts from the Office of the Chief of Integrated Support Services;
(c) Staffing for the Property Disposal Unit is proposed by establishing three new posts (one additional Field Service post, one United Nations Volunteer position and one national General Service staff post).
The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of these proposals.
The Advisory Committee also recommends approval of the following proposals for the reasons given in the report of the Secretary-General, taking into account the fact that the mission requires these functions as it grows past its initial stages and enters the main phase of its work, as with all posts, they should be subject to periodic review on the basis of operational needs:
(a) Redeployment of the post of Administrative Assistant (national General Service staff) to the Human Rights Office (A/59/748, para.
13 (a));
(b) Conversion of 13 National Officer posts to the national General Service staff category, in the Communications and Public Information Office (A/59/748, para.
13 (c));
(c) Establishment of one United Nations Volunteer position of Interpreter/ Translator in the Office of the Force Commander (A/59/748, para.
14);
(d) Change of function of the approved P-4 post of Civilian/Military Liaison Officer to the function of the P-4 Reintegration Planning Officer post (with liaison functions to be transferred to the military component and assumed by a staff officer) in the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
16 (a)); [See also (e) below.
]
(e) Change of function of the P-3 Liaison Officer post to include additional responsibility for the management of quick-impact projects, in the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/748, para.
16 (a));
(f) Establishment of four national General Service staff posts (Language Assistants/Drivers), in the Human Rights Unit, and redeployment to the Unit of one national General Service staff post from the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for a total of five national Language Assistants/Drivers (A/59/748, para.
16 (b));
(g) Establishment of one Administrative Assistant post at the General Service level to assist the Chief of the Gender Issues Unit (A/59/748, para.
16 (c));
(h) Conversion of one national General Service staff post in the Gender Issues Unit to the National Officer category (A/59/748, para.
16 (c));
(i) Establishment of two additional Regional Administrative Officer posts (Field Service) by redeploying one Field Service post from the Joint Logistics Operations Centre and one Field Service post from the Personnel Section, and redeployment of one Administrative Assistant post (General Service) from the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer to the Personnel Section; all posts are in the Division of Administration (A/59/748, para.
18 (a));
(j) Establishment of two Field Service posts and two United Nations Volunteers positions to create a Facilities Management Unit in the General Services Section, Division of Administration (A/59/748, para.
18 (b));
(k) Establishment of four United Nations Volunteers positions (two medical doctors and two nurses) and one national General Service staff (Medical Administrative Assistant) in the Medical Section, Division of Administration (A/59/748, para.

18 (e));
(m) Establishment of two United Nations Volunteers positions (Project Managers) in the Engineering Section, Division of Administration (A/59/748, para.
18 (f));
(n) Establishment of eight United Nations Volunteers positions (four Telecommunications and four Information Technology Technicians) and eight national General Service staff (four Telecommunications and four Information Technology Assistants) in the Communications and Information Technology Section, Division of Administration (A/59/748, para.
18 (g));
(o) Establishment of one United Nations Volunteer position (Technical Compliance Assistant) and one national General Service staff (Flight Follower) in the Aviation Section, Division of Administration (A/59/748, para.
18 (h));
(p) Redeployment of one Field Service post from the Joint Logistics Operations Centre to the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer (A/59/748, para.
18 (a) and (i));
(q) Establishment of posts for one Close Protection Supervisor (P-2), one Associate Investigator (Field Service) and three national General Service staff to strengthen security arrangements at the new ONUB headquarters; the posts are located in the Security Section, Division of Administration (A/59/748, para.
18 (j)).
Other recommendations and observations
The Committee notes that the requirement for 125 international, national and United Nations Volunteer staff for the ONUB Electoral Assistance Office has remained unchanged from 2004/05 to 2005/06.
ONUB clarified that the date for the elections has not yet been determined but that it appeared that the elections would be held during the fourth quarter of 2005.
The unit would be disbanded following the elections and this is reflected in the proposed budget as from 1 October 2005.
The Committee was also informed that, after the elections, ONUB may be asked by the Government to provide assistance and expertise involving future election activities; in that case it is foreseen that up to two staff may be necessary to provide expertise and advice on election issues.
Operational costs
The Committee notes a significantly decreased proposed budget for operational requirements, a reduction by $54,876,700 from 2004/05 to 2005/06.
ONUB appears to employ a vigorous policy to write off assets.
A large number of items are automatically earmarked for write-off although they were recently acquired; these are, for example, office furniture, safes, mattresses, televisions, video recorders, binoculars and night-vision devices.
The Advisory Committee urges the mission to review its inventory management practice and to encourage careful use of assets by civilian and military personnel so that United Nations-owned equipment can be utilized to its full life expectancy.
The Advisory Committee notes that ONUB maintains a fleet of 15 representational vehicles.
The Committee was informed during deliberations with UNMIL that no Headquarters policy had been formulated in this respect.
The Committee recommends that a prudent policy with a view to vehicle sharing be developed.
The Committee comments further on this in its general report.
Conclusions
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of ONUB for the period from 21 April to 30 June 2004 is indicated in paragraph 56 of the proposed budget and expenditure report (A/59/748).
In paragraphs 8 to 10, 17, 24 to 26, 30, 31, 38 and 39 above, the Advisory Committee has made observations and recommendations which should lead to economies.
Moreover, as can be seen from the tables preceding paragraphs 14 and 19, savings are possible from the delayed deployment of civilian police and persistent high vacancy rates for civilian staff.
Bearing in mind that the Secretary-General has authority to administer the budget of the mission, as a whole, reductions may be made either in the areas identified by the Committee or in others, as the situation may warrant.
Under the circumstances, the Committee is of the opinion that requirements for ONUB for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 should not exceed $292,347,600 gross ($284,050,500 net).
This represents a reduction of $4,307,100 from the estimate proposed by the Secretary-General.
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of ONUB for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 is indicated in paragraph 56 of the proposed budget (A/59/748).
In view of its comments above, the Advisory Committee recommends that the estimated budget requirement be reduced from $296,654,700 to $292,347,600.
