Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.
The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families.
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy.
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.
Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable.
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco.
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.
Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography.
'We are in Europe.
Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents' era and their parents' era and, of course, is living in the current era.
We can also see into the era in which our children will live.
In my grandparents' time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville.
Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane.
Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency.
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically.
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable.
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation.
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: "In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British?
Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British.
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question.
Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European?
We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person.
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?'
Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought.
'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too.
What difference does it make to be Basque?
Surely it is all the same thing.
You can be what you want to be.
If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish' .
May he rest in peace.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force.
We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.
It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing.
Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead.
On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez.
In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based.
The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties.
There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people.
We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism.
We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace.
Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country.
We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop.
The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers.
It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children.
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981.
It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez.
It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood.
Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force.
ETA must be condemned.
However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned.
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road.
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are.
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.
All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing.
It is time to share the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.
This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.
So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance.
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism?
Let us make ourselves heard!
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg.
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment.
Madam President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party, I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer, Jorge Díez Elorza, and the Basque MP and former vice-president, Fernando Buesa.
Secondly, we send our deepest condolences to their families, their socialist colleagues, the Basque parliament and the Basque police force.
We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy.
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.
Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country.
Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire.
Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA' s terrorism and violence must end.
ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement, as many other colleagues did.
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered.
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.
We, Euskal Herritarrok, are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda.
Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999.
In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire.
Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country.
We, Euskal Herritarrok, have regretted many times the loss of human lives.
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people.
We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country.
Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament.
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?
Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor.
I must say that it is very hard for me to follow on from the last intervention.
When Mr Puerta mentioned some of ETA' s victims, he made no reference to someone who was killed by ETA 16 years ago.
I believe he did this out of respect for me.
The person I am talking about was a socialist senator who was also a member of the Basque regional parliament.
His name was Enrique Casas.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, Senator Casas was my husband.
I was left a widow with four children, the youngest of whom was only eight months old.
My husband was an Andalusian by birth and a senator for the Basque Country.
He had been sent by the Basque Government to defend the Basque Country in Madrid.
His only crime was that he was a socialist and a democrat and nothing more.
Madam President, I have never spoken of this here apart from on the day that ETA declared the cease-fire which I welcomed as a ray of hope for all Basque people and for the whole of Spain and Europe.
This was the only time I had spoken of my husband' s death but I must do so again today and I do it willingly.
Madam President, I was born in Germany, educated in Sweden and married to a Spaniard.
I know what democracy is because I had the good fortune to grow up in a country like Sweden which has a long democratic tradition.
I arrived in the Basque Country keen to integrate and, despite what has happened to me, I am convinced that some day the Basque Country will achieve the peace it desires.
To those who believe that there is conflict in the Basque Country, I would say that the only conflict in the Basque Country goes by the name of ETA and must be eliminated.
As for the other problems, we can talk about these.
(Loud and sustained applause)
We democrats can solve the other problems by allowing everyone to put forward their ideas, because freedom of expression, free elections and freedom in general do exist in the Basque Country.
The only restriction on this freedom is ETA which must therefore be eliminated.
Then we democrats can talk.
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect.
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet.
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening.
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so.
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.
But we shall have a decision very soon.
(The Minutes were adopted)
Reforming the Commission
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission.
I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi.
- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination.
The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission' s way of working.
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.
I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice.
Briefly, these are the main points of the reform.
One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources.
This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board.
In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance.
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources.
The second point is human resources.
It is the central part of our reform.
Our staff are the Commission' s best asset, its richest resource.
They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used.
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work.
However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low.
Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism.
All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.
Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility.
These are the areas in which changes will be made.
The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security.
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General.
At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system.
This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations.
This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.
We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place.
In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world.
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology.
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration.
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission.
This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission.
This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well.
I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise.
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission.
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well.
The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history.
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever.
Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks.
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan.
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions.
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities.
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission' s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them.
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future.
In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence.
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve.
I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution.
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms.
The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague, Michele Schreyer, to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning: "Reforming the Commission" .
As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements.
Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses.
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context.
In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred.
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.
Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised.
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere.
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance.
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.
The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone.
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly.
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House.
Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years.
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission.
And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us.
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.
If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both.
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.
The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time.
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission' s operations are clearly in no one' s interest.
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management.
In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable.
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.
And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.
In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals.
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.
It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.
I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
We shall now move on to Question Time.
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.
Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions.
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.
Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners?
There is effective legal precaution.
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted.
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.
As the Parliament' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness.
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions.
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside.
And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later.
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.
Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced.
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology.
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.
On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.
Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old.
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices.
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.
I do not use those as an excuse.
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.
It is better to do it absolutely properly.
Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock' s vision and sense of realism.
For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated.
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities.
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first.
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board.
We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace.
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities?
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House.
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have.
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement.
I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.
I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind.
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.
Two questions if I may.
We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure?
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.
Let the managers manage.
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile.
So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented.
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands.
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.
That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain.
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control.
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so.
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.
Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us.
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.
Madam President, I would like to thank President Prodi for his clear exposition of the reform objectives.
We have made it clear in the course of the debates that we have been having in the past few weeks, in particular with Commissioner Kinnock - and in saying this I am taking up what Mr Cox said - that we cannot endorse the wholesale scrapping of independent financial control.
Decentralisation, yes, but we certainly require independent financial control, i.e. a unit in the individual Directorates-General which are, however, directly subordinate to the Financial Controller.
To do otherwise would be to make one and the same body responsible for authorisation and financial control.
We have spelt this out again and again, and also made it very clear in Mr Van Hulten' s report of 19 January, in paragraphs 10 and 11 to be precise.
Now so far I have not had sight of the White Paper and I would like to ask you Mr Kinnock: does it reflect our position?
I have a question concerning ex-ante control, which is still to be carried out where necessary, and on an independent basis at that.
I understood Mr Prodi to say - or I believe I understood him to say - that this ex-ante control will not take place as a matter of course, but neither will it be scrapped wholesale either, and the independence of financial control will be preserved.
Is this reflected in the White Paper?
I will read it with a great deal of interest and very attentively, but perhaps you could give me an idea now as to how these matters have been dealt with in the White Paper.
The question of transitional periods is worrying us.
The expression "soft law" has been bandied about but there is no such thing.
There is neither soft nor hard law.
There is only law, and no transitional period should be written into this reform, since this would lead to legal uncertainty.
I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating.
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.
First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control.
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation.
However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.
So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all.
Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures.
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.
Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used.
Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" .
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.
Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform.
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline.
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring.
Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable.
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature.
My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union.
How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries?
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another.
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in.
It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States.
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering.
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see.
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day.
Thank you for the presentation.
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork.
Excessive paperwork.
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control?
That is a clear complaint that we get.
That needs to be addressed.
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee.
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work?
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words.
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.
As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan.
We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable.
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.
I know I can rely on everyone here.
That concludes Question Time.
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent.
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred.
However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union.
I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President.
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union.
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds.
There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip.
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency.
A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.
However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.
I will speak of this briefly.
If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago.
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.
These were essentially of three types which I will describe.
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations.
This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment.
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.
Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000.
This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council.
Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union.
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch.
You can be satisfied with the progress made.
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.
In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries.
Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union.
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces.
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends.
We are therefore working diligently in this respect.
Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.
We are not mad.
What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki.
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission.
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you.
We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility.
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis.
I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them.
As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year.
This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki.
On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki.
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House.
I will set this out in five points.
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace.
We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well.
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs.
How can we do this?
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match.
We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this.
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.
Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.
I have two further points to make on this process.
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union.
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome.
Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO.
The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types.
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO.
The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO.
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone.
In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.
However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten.
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well.
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force.
Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.
I am not going to say much more on these issues.
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya.
There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you.
However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.
Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny.
When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine.
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating.
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.
In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat.
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you.
Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities.
The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible.
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.
Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech.
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning.
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission.
This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations.
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana.
I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Madam President, this is the second time we have had occasion to enter into discussion with the High Representative Javier Solana, and I would like to begin by addressing a few words to the Commission' s representative, Chris Patten.
The first time we entered into discussion with the High Representative for the CFSP, the Commission, represented by Chris Patten, took the floor, at the request of our Group, and also at my personal request and with the support of all the group chairmen.
I freely admit that we omitted to take this into consideration when drawing up the agenda for today.
Madam President, I would ask you and the group chairmen that, in future, we always ensure that whenever we have discussions with the High Representative, the Commission takes the floor as a matter of form, because the Commission must play its part in the development of European policy....
... and that we should all bear this in mind.
We are fairly and squarely to blame for not having taken this into consideration.
I hope, Commissioner Patten, that you will still have the opportunity to evaluate our discussion.
Mr Solana, you mentioned Sintra.
It was a great achievement to have brought the 15 Defence Ministers together.
There is talk of the military, troops and soldiers, and rightly so.
Things are moving in the right direction, but I want to reinforce the point that the military - troops and soldiers - is not an end in itself; rather it underpins everything we do in the name of human dignity, democracy, the constitutional state, peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.
I had hoped to hear the 15 States of the European Union protest a great deal louder than has proved to be the case in recent weeks, in the face of the murders and crimes perpetrated by the Russian government and the Russian military in Chechnya.
(Applause)
It sometimes seems to me that we are critical of small countries - and sometimes excessively so - but that we knuckle under where large countries are concerned However, our guiding principle must be that wherever crimes are committed, we must respond to this with words and, where possible, with the appropriate measures.
(Applause)
We have made great strides in recent years on account of the Treaty of Maastricht, then the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the outcomes of Saint Malo, Cologne, and now Sintra.
Of course, we welcome this with open arms.
Mr Solana, if we were to start building up this 60 000-strong core of troops now, then it would supposedly be fit for action within 60 days.
However, the rhetoric our governments in the countries of the European Union are using must be followed up with deeds.
Several governments are cutting back on their budgets and also their defence capability.
This goes against all the rhetoric we are hearing these days.
Please encourage the governments in the countries of the European Union to put their money where their mouth is, so that we are not left with rhetoric and less security at the end of the day, but rather we have a more secure Europe.
(Applause) Now our American friends have expressed some concerns, and I emphasise "our American friends" for we do want a North Atlantic Alliance between the USA and Europe that operates in an amicable manner and on the basis of equal rights.
So there are concerns, and people talk in terms of the three "D' s" .
Decoupling, i.e. the fear that Europe might decouple from America, then there is the fear of duplication, i.e. the duplication of military instruments, as well as competences and military command structures.
Lastly, there is discrimination, i.e. the fear that NATO Members that are not members of the EU will be discriminated against.
I urge you, after all, you have the experience having been Secretary-General of NATO, and I am convinced that you will endorse what I am about to say, to allay these fears by taking practical action and ensuring, as the incumbent NATO Secretary-General put it, that we make the three "I' s" a reality: i.e. indivisibility, improvement and inclusion.
The indivisibility of transatlantic security, the improvement of the European capability and, lastly, the inclusion of those European NATO partners who are not members of the European Union in the process.
Military intervention must only ever be a last resort.
I commend you for having made that point.
The best security policy we can pursue in the non-military sense is the enlargement of the European Union eastwards, so as to achieve greater stability there, and dialogue with the Arab and Islamic states, so as to be able to live in peace with the countries in the Mediterranean region as well.
A final comment: I heard, to my amazement and wonder, that the Belgian Defence Minister, Flahaut, declared in Sintra that Belgium wished to break off its military and political relations with Austria.
Now I do not know what these military and political relations are, but I am bound to say that there is an unacceptable moral arrogance behind such considerations which is unworthy of a government of a country whose capital hosts the European institutions.
Let us put an end to this isolationism which creates divisions between countries and peoples by pulling together instead.
For only if we pull together within the European Union and live in harmony will we also be able to set an example for peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts outside the European Union.
I urge those of the 14 States who are conducting themselves in the way I have roundly criticised the Belgian government for to work to this end.
Let us be peaceable and live in harmony ourselves.
That is why we must pull together and not isolate anyone within the European Union.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.
Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later?
(The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you.
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite).
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.
We know that you have an important role in this.
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.
We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group.
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means.
The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.
It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica.
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail.
Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation.
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy.
At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo.
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force.
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action.
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.
On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre.
My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?
How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission?
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks.
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights.
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament.
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.
When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged.
So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either.
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers.
As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo.
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats.
Everything else is wishful thinking.
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment.
We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny.
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States.
No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament.
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army.
It will be a force comprised of various national units.
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment.
However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament.
As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion.
Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister.
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table.
We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired.
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all.
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006.
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles.
I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment.
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.
A man with three children and he was murdered.
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.
I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all?
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war.
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so.
He is not always right, but in this case he is.
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia.
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party!
In the current situation, we should say to the Russians "If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia" .
If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres.
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.
It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!"
They know full well that they should not commit these acts.
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good?
But that is his strategy, he instigated this war.
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.
So that is the world as it is today.
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments.
First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers.
If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians.
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.
Mr President, this is the second time that we have welcomed the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, and I am among those who wish for such occasions to take place fairly regularly.
What my Group deplores, however, Mr Solana, is that you seem to wish to fulfil your important responsibilities in far too unilateral a fashion.
First of all, you only deal with the security considerations in their military dimension, by making virtual deadlock with regard to what we believe is essential, that is to say, a major policy of prevention, very much upstream of the risks of conflict, that would in itself deserve a common strategy at Union level.
Furthermore, in the autonomous defence capability that you propound, if what you claim as a defence capability to be mobilised is only too clear, as it involves on average the doubling of the expenditure invested in the military field, its autonomy is, on the contrary, much more of a problem, judging by the degree of NATO, and therefore United States' , involvement in European decisions on defence that one part of the Council and, it would seem, you personally, wish for.
Finally and in particular, we hardly hear you speak at all about the other part of your mission: the foreign policy of the Union.
In our view, you cannot be content with a kind of minimum service in this field, as current events remind us at the moment.For example, take the case of Chechnya.
For six months now, owing to sordid ambitions of power, the Russian administration has been conducting a dirty colonial war, piling on more dreadful atrocities every day.
Beyond the rather general remarks that you have made and that you are no doubt going to reiterate here, what is the Union' s current strategy towards Russia?
Forgive me for saying so, but up to now we have only observed lenience and inertia, while this great country is sinking before our eyes into an increasingly uncontrollable and dangerous situation for the peace and security of the whole continent.
As regards the Middle East, the peace process is getting bogged down and tensions are again rising in a very worrying way.
What initiatives do the Fifteen envisage to prevent the glimmer of hope that arose at the time with the defeat of Mr Netanyahu from being, in turn, extinguished, opening the way for something worse.
In the Balkans, a year after the NATO bombings started and in the light of the significant crisis in Mitrovica, are you prepared to carry out a critical evaluation of the whole strategy implemented in this region in order to learn some useful lessons?
In the South, particularly Africa, the unbearable pictures that we have seen from Mozambique cannot be explained solely by the natural disaster, but reflect the pitiless consequences of under-development.
They call into question the ambitions that we set ourselves with regard to this part of the world and, consequently, the changes to be advocated in the current world order, or rather, disorder.
Finally to the Echelon network: are you, at the very least, going to ask that this incredible affair be tabled on the agenda of the next European Union-United States Summit?
My Group would like our dialogue, our cooperation and, where appropriate, our political confrontations, to be included too, and primarily, among these issues.
Many people expect that of us, in Europe and throughout the world.
I think these meetings are not to be missed.
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist.
We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics.
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously' called autonomous.
Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.
But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether.
What interests will this so-called force defend, in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests?
Let us just consider for a moment.
What is the basis of armed action?
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss.
In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy?
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history.
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.
Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same.
Of course, in reality, they are the same thing.
It is still the old imperial service.
It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .
You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions' , because that is what we see, in fact.
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.
Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit.
In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.
Do you think I am going over the top?
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.
Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here.
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!
On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you.
You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war.
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?
Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on?
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking.
When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope.
'Restore hope' , do you remember?
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.
Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace.
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.
Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now.
This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year.
In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation.
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans.
Given Poland' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.
As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO' s unity.
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .
We all very much share this opinion.
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.
The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion.
In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible.
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" .
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana.
Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us!
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries?
Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members' questions this time round.
On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana' s fault.
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union.
In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.
This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit?
I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?
I would like to hear your opinion.
Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee?
In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.
Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.
You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere.
For my part, I do not wish to give up hope.
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.
Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve.
But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means.
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety.
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings?
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?
My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one.
It concerns the next IGC.
Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established?
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February.
Can you tell us your position on this subject?
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.
At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative.
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.
However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.
He is not stupid.
Certainly not!
He is a driven man, a competent man.
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence.
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President.
From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable.
This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament.
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact.
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.
This too is unacceptable in my view.
Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself.
Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être.
I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.
But look at us now!
We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies.
Some of them are our ACP partners.
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.
In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia.
We are now unable to guide the peace.
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union.
I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means.
As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us.
We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term.
This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level.
In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all.
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea.
Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo.
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.
Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities.
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.
On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet.
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.
I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going.
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.
My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community.
Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.
Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter.
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much.
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.
As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example.
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy.
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.
According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful.
You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch.
You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks.
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light?
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent.
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course.
The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar.
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.
Actually, I hear less and less about this.
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well.
But is there not more to it than that?
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.
The European pillar does not really function any more as such.
Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks.
Is this actually how we want things done?
Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us.
Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg.
Will it be omitted?
At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets.
I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks.
I wonder how this will develop.
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future.
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy?
The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities.
That would seem odd to me.
Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door.
Will they also take part in our defence policy?
It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least.
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.
However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.
A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation.
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?
Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner Patten, the most recent steps taken by the Council on the European security and defence policy front are, to my mind, in flagrant contravention of the principle of democratic control with regard to military operations.
Whilst the three new committees are up and running as of today, the question of parliamentary control remains completely unclear and open.
The Portuguese presidency has already conceded this, whereas you, Mr Solana, have not said so much as one word about it.
We therefore demand extensive involvement for the European Parliament in matters of security when it comes to widening the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference.
The second way in which the Sintra meeting fell short was that although there are now efficient military decision-making structures, the concept of non-military crisis management is still completely nebulous.
However, the ability of the European Union to undertake non-military crisis prevention takes precedence in our view.
In other words: it takes precedence in terms of the sequence of events and European intervention, but also in terms of the provision of resources.
Hence, this is precisely the area where any increase in funding in the sphere of non-military capabilities must be concentrated.
Again, this is something you made no mention of whatsoever today, Mr Solana.
If you allocate 0.7% of national budgets for military armaments, then I wonder if it would not make a great deal more sense to earmark 10% of the EU budget for conflict prevention.
For then we would be able to save the 0.7% from the national budgets which is allocated for military purposes, and this is, of course, a much more significant amount.
Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face.
I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined.
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it.
You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana.
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.
Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator.
Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia.
It is you who has created this mess.
Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans.
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary.
For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment.
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.
My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me.
You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing' .
Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.
You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee.
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.
In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union?
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.
Mr President, High Representative for the CFSP, Commissioner Patten, on behalf of my Group I would like to address one particular area alone, which falls both within the remit of the High Representative and that of the Commissioner, i.e. Turkey' s candidacy for accession to the European Union.
My Group was unanimous in its support for the decision reached in Helsinki to afford Turkey an option for accession with the proviso that this country, like any other candidate, must fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria.
My Group attaches great importance to the fact that Turkey is being encouraged to fulfil these criteria.
We have been concerned of late about the political developments taking place in Turkey, the arrest of the three mayors for example.
That is not moving towards fulfilment of the criteria; on the contrary, it constitutes a move in the opposite direction.
Hence my questions, Mr Solana, which could equally well be addressed to Commissioner Patten: how, and according to what timetable, is Turkey to be brought up to EU standards following the Helsinki decision?
Is there a list of tasks and a concrete schedule, in accordance with which, little by little, Turkey is to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria, notably the political criteria?
And what supervisory and monitoring instruments have been put in place, both by the Council and, more importantly, by the Commission, with a view to overseeing this process of criteria fulfilment?
Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence.
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against.
I will give you an example.
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region.
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.
In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community.
This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination.
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?
Mr President, I would like to make a few observations and raise questions regarding the Balkans in the light of task distribution within our Group.
I am aware that we are saddling the High Representative with a huge number of questions on a huge number of topics.
This indicates the enormity of the problem which Mr Solana is and will be tackling in future.
We have talked extensively about the EU' s future security framework and about the need to organise a military force of
60 000.
It is somewhat ironic to be contemplating these issues when we appear unable to locate a sufficiently large police force to deal with the situation in Kosovo.
Accordingly, I would like to make a few observations, not about the security framework of tomorrow, but about security in the Balkan region today.
Coordinator Hombach and Commissioner Patten are working hard to push through the Solidarity Pact.
Last week, Mr Hombach stated in this Parliament that there are now plans and projects in the pipeline which are waiting for the Stability Pact and the Danube Conference later this month.
Two weeks ago in Strasbourg, we also talked extensively to Commissioner Patten about relations with Macedonia.
These are all positive developments from which the Balkans stand to benefit.
What concrete role does the High Representative see carved out for himself?
What will his contribution be towards a smooth transition from the Solidarity Pact to the Danube Conference, for that is where we need to concentrate our efforts?
We are waiting for the European Union' s Balkan strategy, in other words for the Stability Pact to be given its political packaging.
What other political initiatives does the High Representative anticipate on the part of the EU?
Also, on a practical level: how does he think he can use the new political situation in Croatia to make political progress in the region?
In particular I have in mind the further stabilisation of Bosnia.
We really should be able to leave this region at some point in the future.
In exchange, I think Croatia is entitled to know where it stands with the EU.
I think that the new government can also be of help in the political relations with Belgrade.
Finally, I would like to mention the countries which are more on the fringe of our policy: Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus.
What can the EU do to counter negative trends in these countries?
We all know that we will not be able to retreat safely behind the borders of an enlarged European Union in the long run.
Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure.
Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf.
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
If this happens, the United States' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention.
A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284.
However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed.
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war.
Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late.
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.
Mr President, High Representative, there is an interesting debate going on in France at present about some of the things the Prime Minister said when he visited Israel.
The debate is interesting in that one of the questions it addresses is: who is a terrorist?
The debate is also interesting because it is about the relationship between the Prime Minister and the President.
However, I certainly do not intend to become embroiled in this debate.
It is just that I wonder, Mr Solana, why no one asks what the European position is?
Why does it not actually occur to anyone to ask what stance Europe takes on this issue, for surely that ought to be the all-important question!
Surely a point of controversy between a Prime Minister and a President about an issue as important as this, at a flash point so close to Europe, ought to be irrelevant in view of the fact that Europe as a whole should have a position in this regard.
Therefore, I would also like to ask you in this connection, what you intend to do, for example, when it comes to the Middle East - unfortunately peace will be slower in coming than we would like it to be, particularly a lasting peace - in order to expound and assert a European position, and to make it plain for all to see in this important region.
This is partly the task of the Commission, but it is also a task that you must surely take on board.
This is also particularly relevant to the very important dialogue with the Arab world and the Islamic world, and to the various centres of conflict around the world, one example being the situation in western Sahara, which is by no means unimportant.
I therefore believe that the European Union - in addition to the military aspects, which I would like to place great emphasis on, particularly when it comes to peace in this region, which is not a million miles away from us - should have a clear and unequivocal position.
I hope that, once the other important issues have been dealt with, you will also find the time to see to it that a common European position is enunciated.
As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique.
This has not just happened.
The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need.
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.
For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention.
I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.
These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO.
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO.
After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table.
NATO is largely European.
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular.
Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?
How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive?
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres?
If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.
The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers.
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective.
Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki.
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world.
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.
However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently.
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?
What about the infrastructures?
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?
Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system?
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?
Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira?
How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting?
Has any thought been given to the matter?
Has it been discussed?
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?
Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job.
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.
That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far.
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.
And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security.
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others.
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.
They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare.
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.
We cannot leave it simply to governments.
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy.
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction.
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.
I am anxious to know how effective the EU' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.
While Commissioner Patten' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves?
I would also like to support Mr Titley' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites.
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with.
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya.
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights.
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.
So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya.
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them.
Mr President, Mr Solana, I don' t want to repeat everything that has already been said here.
I will confine myself to asking more questions, as you suggested we should do.
I regard the Stability Pact as the best idea we have ever had.
However, it must also actually be made to work in such a way that it does not just serve to create frustrations, hence my questions.
Firstly: to what extent are you able to influence the professionalism of the Council' s decisions?
Could you at last bring about change in this respect?
Let me give you an example: there is an institution in Thessaloniki that does not actually exist at all as yet, but it has been set up, namely the Reconstruction Agency for whatever, for the whole of the Balkan region.
At the same time, the Stability Pact was established here in Brussels with a single coordinator.
Can you tell me how much synergy is lost here and why the Council allows something like that to happen?
This is grossly unprofessional!
Can you prevent this from happening in future?
Secondly, when you talk to the Ministers for Home Affairs on Saturday it must not just be about the remote possibility of sending police officers.
I would ask you quite specifically: the police officers in Kosovo at present number scarcely a third of those promised and who are due to travel there.
KFOR could step up its presence in Mitrovica and be stationed in crisis areas of Kosovo if its current tasks were to be taken on by policemen.
Thirdly, could you convince the Council of the fact that its rhetoric at summit meetings must at last be put into practice, in the form of additional financial resources?
We need a special fund for crisis regions, so that we are not always taking funds away from other necessary tasks for which financial provision has already been made from other sources; in other words, so as to avoid having to reallocate this money to implement ideas that the Council has suddenly hit on.
We need a crisis fund which can then be used to pay for such eventualities.
Lastly, a word on the subject of Chechnya.
It is all well and good, and touching, when we wring our hands over the mass graves and the refugees.
Only I have to ask myself what have we actually done to try and prevent it?
Why did we not send an intervention force there when all this was happening?
(Heckling from Mr Cohn-Bendit) We cannot do that, my dear Daniel.
Why have we not stopped sending the money that is financing the army over there?
I believe that is what our task ought to have been, and you could play a part in this!
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana.
How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments?
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.
If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk.
Take, for example, Germany' s defence savings.
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping.
Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.
In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations.
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.
My second question concerns the following matter.
Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters.
I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.
It has been a very long session of questions.
I tend to think that maybe Mr Van den Bos is right that I would need the capacity of the angels to answer so many questions in such a short period of time, but I will try.
I will try to do it and I am going to answer one by one all the questions that have been put to me, even if the Member who has put the question is no longer here or tired because of the long session, because they had more important things to do than to listen.
But let me start with the first.
To Mr Poettering I would like to say that we are not trying to duplicate anything.
That question has been put by many Members of the Parliament.
We are not trying to duplicate anything.
We are trying to do as much as possible so that the European Union has capabilities to act in case of need and at the same time the global security of the European Union, of the countries that belong to our alliance, will be maintained and will be secure.
We are not in the business of creating a European Army.
If anybody answered that, he is wrong.
We are not in the business of creating a European Army.
We are in the business of creating capabilities that, put together in case of need, can avoid tragedies such as those we have recently experienced.
It is very important to be talking about prevention.
It is very important.
I can tell you, and you know, that prevention capabilities exist already in the Union.
We do not have to invent them.
They exist already.
Is ECHO not a preventative agency?
Is our capability to act diplomatically not a preventative capability?
What we did not have at all was the possibility of acting at the other extreme of the spectrum of crisis management.
The European Union is going to be, at the end of the day, the most important group of countries able to face problems related to crisis matters, from the humanitarian crises to force deployment.
In Mozambique if it is necessary, or in the countries of Europe if it is necessary.
In a very few days Eurocorps built up by European countries is going to be deployed to Kosovo not to walk around, but to prevent people from killing one another.
And I would like to tell my friend Mr Cohn-Bendit that at this very moment,
45 000 soldiers from our country - not from any other country - the majority from our country - are deployed in Kosovo - to do what?
To prevent people from killing one another.
Do you think really that because we deploy soldiers, we are going change the minds of people who have been suffering for centuries?
Do you imagine for a moment that because we deploy soldiers, the souls and the minds of people are going to change.
How many centuries will it take to change the mentality of countries which have been fighting against one another morally, psychologically, even physically for years?
Do you really think that by deploying troops on the ground, the minds of people are going to change?
Soldiers can prevent people from killing one another, but they cannot guarantee that people will love each other.
It would be fantastic, but really for me the most important gift would be to be able to deploy European forces to make people love each other where they were killing each other.
Unfortunately, even with the capacities I have, even with the number of jobs that I supposedly have, even with the little sleep that I get, it is impossible to do that.
But let me also tell you something.
Even if we deployed policemen, as you have demanded, this would not completely solve the problem.
Do you honestly think that in Mitrovica policemen from UN countries would solve the problem?
We need, at this point, still to have a deployment of military personnel and then in other places, of course, we need policemen.
But do governments have the capacity to deploy policemen at the rate that is required.
We are trying very hard, but it is very difficult to do this.
Military personnel in our countries are waiting for a crisis.
Policemen in our countries are working 24 hours a day, and for governments it is difficult sometimes to find the appropriate police force to be deployed.
We do not need unarmed policemen or traffic policemen.
We need something very different, to serve as an interface between military and police and that is a very difficult profile which that does not exist in many countries.
Those countries that do have this are deploying them and I feel they are doing what they can.
As you know, Mr Patten and I are working very, very hard to deploy, or to make or convince countries to deploy as many policemen as possible.
Now, Mr Haarder asked about the risk of a rift between the European Union and NATO.
I do not think there is a risk.
I think we can do something which is compatible and would be beneficial for everybody.
For us as Europeans, it would represent a link.
I do not see why we should become estranged or split or damage the capacity that we have to continue working together.
But then again, we are not trying to create a European army.
To explain to you the whole foreign policy of the European Union in the fifty minutes that you have given me would be an almost impossible task.
Instead I wanted to share with you the latest step which I think has been very important in the last three months, and I think I have the obligation to tell you all that.
Now, do we need a sort of civilian corps to be deployed?
The people who are there already with their white uniforms, the white uniforms of the European Union have been deployed in Bosnia for many, many years and are now deployed in Kosovo.
The person in charge of the UN is a European and a good man, Mr Bernard Kouchner, who is doing a lot.
This is another manner in which Europeans are committed to the peace in Kosovo.
I have not talked especially about the Middle East, but you know we can spend hours talking about that.
Let me say two things only.
The Troika visited the Middle East at the beginning of the year.
It visited all the countries of the region and got a clear picture of what is going on there.
Unfortunately, at this very moment the Syrian track is still not moving although there is some possibility that in the near future it may.
As you know, the Palestinian track is in difficulty at this very moment.
If there is some light, some progress might be made but at this point I have no good news to report to you.
The European Union, the European countries are doing their best to continue cooperating in the peace process and offering to help all parties when it is required in order to implement the agreements that will be reached.
That help will be needed.
At that time, we will have to come here to argue for help, because probably in the budget that we have now in the European Union, we do not have money to tackle the problems that it may be necessary to tackle if the agreement, a just agreement, is reached in the region.
Many questions have been asked about what I think about the IGC, security, defence, etc.
I do not know how to answer that question.
As you know, the IGC has a structure with a limited agenda.
I have the impression that as time goes by the agenda will be enlarged, but that is probably an impression that I had, an impression that probably you share with me, but I am not in the position to make an affirmation or to state that.
It is something that we will see evolving as time goes by.
Let me answer the specific questions about the statement that has been made by the Minister for Defence of France about 0.7.
He never said 0.7 with reference to expenditure on defence.
He was referring, if I understood properly, to research including military research.
I think this is an objective that the countries have to decide if they want to do it or not.
With regard to the documents of Sintra which are being finalised, the document which the political committee is working on, I do not have the authority to share it with you at this point, but without any doubt it will be shared with you.
I will be more than happy to cooperate concerning the political committee in times of crises in the future.
In reply to the question about Article V, we have two article Vs as you know.
One Article V for those countries that belong to the alliance and the other Article V for the countries that belong to the WEU.
The WEU is going to transfer its assets to the European Union, or certain parts.
It still is not clear what is going to happen to Article V itself.
As you know, there are countries in the European Union which are not ready and they will not accept a transfer of Article V, Brussels article, into the European Union framework and therefore we cannot do it.
If you want to include defence in the IGC it probably will not be possible to go so far as to incorporate Article V of the Brussels Treaty into the IGC.
How far will foreign policy be brought under the Community framework in the coming years?
I do not know.
You are asking the question to the wrong person - I do not know.
I have various ideas about that, but it will be the Intergovernmental Conference and, by definition, the countries, the governments who take the decisions; and therefore I have my own ideas but I am sure that is not interesting for you to know my own ideas.
It is much more important to see what the country has done.
To Mr Morillon I would like to answer a few questions.
I know that he has been an expert on these questions for the many, many years that he has been dealing with them.
I would like to say that as regards the status of those countries which are not members of the European Union but which are members of the alliance and eventually will be members of the European Union, we would like to get them involved.
To get them involved upstream before a decision is taken for an operation and downstream when the decision has been taken and if they want to participate in the crisis management operation, then we treat them as equals with the same rights and the same obligations that the other countries have.
Mr Galeote Quecedo asked about the diplomatic corps in the European Union.
Well this is something that a lot of people are thinking about.
I do not think that it will take place tomorrow.
After the conversation we have had with the Commission it is a good idea to move in that direction but we are a long way off from a diplomatic corps as such.
Cooperation, helping as much as possible, is possible, but to go in that direction to the end, unfortunately is a distant vision at this time.
There were several questions about the stability pact.
The stability pact is going to figure high on the agenda in late March of the first financial conference in which projects are going to be discussed.
It is working well and I very much hope that it will be a great success for the countries of the region and also for the European Union.
The European Union is not the only contributor but without any doubt it is a major contributor.
I fought against dictatorship for many years, I suffered a lot, I have been in jail and I am very, very proud to be here to defend the European Union, the democratic Parliament and to tell you that we are prepared to deploy forces not to make war but to make peace.
You know very well that Helsinki took a very important decision, a very important decision concerning Chechnya.
The Prime Ministers and Heads of Government took an important decision.
We were the only group of countries that took a decision like that.
We decided not only on words but also on deeds and two important decisions were taken concerning trade and humanitarian aid.
That was done and is continuing to be done
Tomorrow and the day after Chris Patten and myself will have a meeting with Mr Ivanov and the Presidency of course, in Lisbon.
We will have again a meeting with the United States the following day and then we will have a trilateral meeting, the United States and European Union and Russia together in which, as you can imagine, the number one item on the agenda is going to be Chechnya.
We are doing what we can.
We have not stopped putting all the pressure upon them because we are very much aware of the crisis that will ensue, not only for today but for tomorrow, if, at the end of the day, Russia evolves in a direction that is no good for anybody.
We want to have a solid bilateral relationship with Russia.
It is very important for Europe, but we want to have that with a Russia that understands that certain things cannot be done.
That is what we have been saying, that is what has guided our actions from the very beginning and I think as you look at the position that Mr Patten and I have maintained from the very beginning, you can look in the records and see that what we are saying - what I am saying now, is the truth.
There are probably many more questions that were asked.
Let me end - I do not want to take up your time any longer - by saying that I am ready to come here whenever you want but I would prefer, if it is possible, to have sessions in which we concentrate on some topics and develop them to the fullest, because if not, we have so many topics, so many issues that it is very difficult to really treat them in depth.
I am prepared to do it - you know that from me and I am really ready to do it whenever is necessary.
At this very moment, I wanted to share with you one important thing.
Helsinki was in December and our Prime Ministers and our Heads of State asked us to do something very important for the first time.
To have capabilities and make an effort for crisis management even for the military.
I am proud to tell you that two months after that we have started and we are moving in the right direction.
I think that the Members of the Parliament, as representatives of our citizens should be proud of that.
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative.
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality.
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject.
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament.
Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe' s ambitions in the area of CFSP.
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.
As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative' s remarks today were extremely encouraging.
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources.
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management.
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks.
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative' s policy unit.
Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.
It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example.
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner.
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green.
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer' and the reply was 'a black grandmother' .
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.
We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing.
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well.
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences.
So again, rhetoric and reality.
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate.
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon.
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation.
All those things come together.
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment.
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique.
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools.
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise.
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere.
We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks.
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related.
We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.
Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric.
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?' .
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans.
I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it.
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia
Where is the beef?
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy.
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' .
I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more.
We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.
Women in the decision-making process
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process.
.
(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, celebrating International Women' s Day is a necessary step in the process of women attaining the position which they have always deserved because of their innate dignity.
Celebrating this day should involve bringing together two basic aspects: first, the aspect which makes us remember our ability to relate to the history of this cause and of everyone associated with it, and amongst these I would like to highlight, in order to be completely fair, non-governmental organisations.
There is also the symbolic aspect, which has the potential to take the cause of equal opportunities for men and women into the future.
By eliminating something that has always been sidelined, this celebration will contribute to men and women seeing themselves as both the origin and the purpose of their own dignity, in a process which is concerned not so much with sanctifying time, but with purifying it of prejudice.
This kind of celebration makes sense because, by discussing the past, we give ourselves the opportunity to free ourselves of the stigma which has, throughout history, affected women because they have been forced to live in poverty, because they have had to accept second place in terms of education, and because they are naturally weaker, which exposes them to gratuitous violence, and to being forcibly excluded from positions of power and from the decision-making process.
Furthermore, women have suffered because of their health, which is affected by motherhood, by violence, and even by sexual exploitation.
They have also suffered from the burden society imposes on them in terms of family responsibility, a weak economic position and, as regards employment, from lack of time for themselves, and also, from the whole complex process of treating women as sexual objects, from which they suffer as regards the media, trafficking in women and sexual exploitation.
The list of human rights which are abused where women are concerned simply goes on and on.
The scholars of ancient Greece bequeathed to us the assumption that there is a natural link between equality and justice.
Aristotle was unequivocal in stating that "the just man complies with the law, adheres to equality and makes us comply with the law and equality, whereas the unjust man leads us to illegality and inequality" .
In contrast with the apparent simplicity of this philosophy, however, Voltaire warned us two thousand years later that "equality is the most natural cause and at the same time the most utopian.
As man is given to excess in everything, when he can be, he is excessive in his inequality" .
Modernity and the system of democracy in which it exists is based on the idea of a social contract, a form of association which, in the words of Rousseau, "defends and protects the person and property of each member with all common force and according to which each member, in association with the others, nevertheless only obeys himself and remains as free as before.
As a result of each person committing himself completely, the conditions are the same for everyone.
Because the conditions are the same for everyone, it is in no one' s interests to make the conditions more difficult for anyone else" .
We know however, that these conditions of equality and universality did not include women.
In post-modern society, now that we have declared that Rousseau' s social contract is no longer sufficient, we must call for a new form of contract, one which is richer and more enriching because it is more in tune with human nature, with its natural polarity between men and women.
We must seek a new kind of social contract between men and women, but this proposal is a result of democracy itself.
We are living in an era in which politics has become debased and in which democracies suffer from a lack of political commitment on the part of their citizens.
We must look at this fact in the light of the implications of the combination of citizenship and democracy, concepts which mutually define each other.
To my mind, preventing women from fully exercising their rights as citizens is one of the determining factors in the crisis of democracy, which only an integrated policy on gender equality can help to reverse.
This highlights the goal of parity, which will take shape when a democracy of equals emerges, a new model which will bring about a new social contract between men and women, a path or short-cut towards an inclusive society.
Globalisation has various implications for democracy.
It accordingly highlights the need for a new ethic, as the shortcomings of personal and social ethics have been demonstrated time and time again.
The concepts of fluidity, mobility and speed are taking hold on a hitherto unseen scale: a world-wide scale.
Concepts and realities such as transnationalism, regionalism and tribalism have established a permanent place for themselves in our daily lives, causing problems and dilemmas, often in very drastic ways.
Whilst progress towards democracy being irreversibly established throughout the world appears to have become an accepted fact, we are discovering at the same time the extent of the social suffering caused by the effect of globalisation on the weakest sectors of society and therefore on women, as poverty insists on being a feminine word and on having a feminine face.
The truth is that the accumulation of wealth and power has led to a rise in the number of socially excluded people.
Technological progress has brought with it an increase in unemployment.
The globalisation of the economy and of financial systems has stripped the state of powers it previously had, and the state has now been relegated to the position of a parallel state.
At the same time and as a result of this, we are seeing the emergence of nomadism, which is making social inclusion more difficult to achieve - another point to add to the factors I have already mentioned.
In short, exclusion certainly takes many forms, but it is a constant source of shame within our system, which is coming to be defined as the "democracy of our discontent" , in other words, a process of exclusion, disaffection, stigmatisation and disqualification unparalleled in history or in any part of the world.
Under the Portuguese presidency, and bearing in mind the efforts and the contributions made by the various Member States, the Lisbon Special Summit, which will be held on the theme 'Employment, economic reform and social cohesion: towards a new Europe of innovation and knowledge' , seeks to counter these risks, which have historically always been more serious for women, particularly in those areas most directly related to the specific theme proposed.
So the summit is intended to adopt measures which will establish conditions for access to knowledge, to lifelong training and to overcoming the constraints that make people shy away from technological advances with all the implications that this may have.
We are therefore seeking to overhaul the European social model and at the same time to increase employment and social cohesion.
We are seeking to adopt a position which will reverse the traditional exclusion of women, which is determined by the responsibilities traditionally assumed by women.
This will only be possible if there is a new social contract in which reconciling family life and professional life is given strategic importance and in which "sharing" is the key word.
It is, however, in the world of politics that the exclusion of women can be seen most vividly.
That is why the choice of today' s subject shows such good judgement, as it will be a determining factor in the future, once equality is established in legal terms.
Introducing the feminine approach is crucial if we are to deal with the complexities of modern life.
It is obvious that the lack of real equality betrays a lack of legitimacy in our political structures and demonstrates how unrepresentative they are.
All of this reveals the inadequacy of simply establishing legal equality which, although it was intended to guarantee equality from the outset, has not been able to guarantee this in practice.
The supposed universality of the writings of the founders of modern democracy, whom I mentioned earlier, did not involve treating women as citizens.
Women were not thought of as having rights.
Given that real democracy presupposes and implies the equal participation of all citizens, on this evidence the difference between the sexes leads to a significant strengthening of the democratic system.
Humanity is divided into two sexes, and we need a system in which discussions and decisions are undertaken by men and women on an equal basis.
Parity means a balance between men and women in the way social and political representation are structured.
Being a woman is one of the two fundamental ways of being human.
Women and men are aspects of humankind that separate as much as they unite and these two sides are therefore brought into constant competition with each other.
A balanced democracy, if we accept this observation, derives benefit from the creativity this generates and uses it to make decisions which are the most correct, fair and appropriate to the problems that they are seeking to solve.
That is why I believe in parity, the new face of sexual equality, which gives universality back its true meaning and its rightful place in a politically organised society.
The Beijing Action Platform represents an historic point in the long journey that we are talking about today.
Therefore, the assessment of it which is now under way must not be an excuse for taking a step backwards.
It is not a new declaration, merely an assessment of how the Member States that have signed up to it are actually complying with it.
Its principles, the values it enshrines and the objectives it seeks to achieve must be upheld.
It is true that it could go further, but it should never be disparaged.
This is the position that the EU must adopt.
The conclusions of the European assessment procedure carried out in January in Geneva are in line with this and confirm once again the need to fully implement the twelve areas identified.
The process leading up to the launch of the Fifth Community Programme for Gender Equality 2001-2005 is also under way.
From what we know of this process, it seems obvious that it is crucial to pursue and strengthen the policy of equality between men and women at Community level because, despite all the progress made and all the work done, we still see significant examples of disparity between men and women in economic, political, social and civil terms.
In its capacity as the current holder of the presidency of the Union, Portugal welcomes this programme and wishes it success so that we can build a Europe of equal opportunities for all.
Women and men shape and structure the societies in which they live through the interplay of the differences between them.
This proposal offers a new way of viewing public and private life; it is designed to combat the public' s suspicion of politicians and of their behaviour, an alternative designed to overcome distrust about the way in which democratic structures function and about their transparency.
Furthermore, this is a process designed to minimise the disaffection felt by sections of the public towards the traditional political parties and their approach to politics.
The policy of gender equality brings a certain added value to society by benefiting women as well as men in terms of helping them to fulfil their personal, social and professional potential.
It will furthermore contribute considerably to social progress, by acknowledging and fostering each gender' s own resources, by helping to strengthen democracy, by bringing the decision-making process closer to the voting public, by introducing new approaches to the political scene which take specific account of women, and by helping to improve the quality of life and to strengthen democracy.
A Portuguese thinker, reflecting on the issue of equality in 1922, stressed that "a prerequisite for equality is equality of rights and power."
I am sure that no one could deny the wisdom of his attitude, and that no one who recognises the truth of it would deny that it is a fundamental part of democracy.
So let us build that democracy!
This is the only way in which we will be able truthfully to state that humanity is a form of solidarity that has continued throughout history.
Mr President, two centuries ago, during the French Revolution, a very famous woman, Olympe de Gouges, was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women.
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.
The last century was marked by three periods.
The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women' s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women.
This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised.
There were women everywhere.
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halïnen.
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.
And a woman was elected.
The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio.
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.
But the figures tell the true story.
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small.
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.
What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.
And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.
Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.
The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important.
These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State.
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool.
The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring.
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector.
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light.
There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres.
Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.
A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes.
It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed.
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.
Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power.
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say.
And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked.
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.
I should like to be absolutely categorical.
There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.
(Applause)
Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet.
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.
We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles.
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.
The bet before us is a bet with time.
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.
If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.
(Applause)
Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject.
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres.
Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved.
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work.
This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole.
Women always have a different viewpoint from men.
This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve.
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making.
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women.
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men.
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent.
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.
Some Members have even come out against this.
Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman.
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council.
At the beginning of this century, the French government sent out a beacon, a bombshell on the equality of opportunity policy front.
For the first time, there must be equal representation of men and women on electoral lists.
In taking this step, the Head of Government, Lionel Jospin, has also set down a marker for the European Union.
It happens to be today that Finland' s newly elected President, Tarja Halonen, takes up office.
And so the women in Finland have also set down a marker, for this is the first time they have had a female Head of State.
Unfortunately, the same does not hold true everywhere.
Sadly, less than 7% of the contenders for the next elections in Greece will be women.
There, too, there is certainly a lot of catching up to be done.
They did not follow the Council recommendation of 1996 on equal involvement for women and overcoming the under-representation of women.
Although women form the majority of the European population, they are still largely on the sidelines.
When they aspire to higher office they soon hit the glass ceiling.
We should fight to break through this glass ceiling.
Unlike the previous speaker, it is my belief - and my Group is united on this - that we should set quotas, and binding quotas at that, for women have worked hard.
Women have an outstanding profile in the European Union; we have demonstrated team spirit and have acquired decision-making powers and social competences.
Binding quotas also require reliable statistics and must not be excluded from any sector of society.
We need this new social treaty, we need the fight for power, money and distribution of work, which must favour women.
Looking back, I would say that the men could have given us solid support in this fight.
Unfortunately, they have made little effort in this regard as well.
It is my hope that we will continue to work on the Beijing Action Platform and that we will have the vision to progress from having a Women' s Day to a Women' s Millennium.
Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women.
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here.
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.
If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power.
That is absolutely crucial.
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.
Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.
Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves.
What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power.
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden.
Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark.
And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark.
In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland.
We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing.
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures.
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally.
The first is the issue of the media' s influence.
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish.
Do we have a special problem in this regard?
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question.
I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain.
The second point is the enlargement of the Union.
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves.
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process.
In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures.
We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system.
I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked.
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen.
Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman' s right to vote, should be linked to the women' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for.
It is also worth noting that International Women' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years.
In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda.
Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process.
Women are no homogenous collective.
Women belong to different social classes.
Women have different individual needs and interests.
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add).
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research.
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made.
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up.
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined.
It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications.
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.
This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today' s decision makers.
Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday.
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day.
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.
Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother.
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.
Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.
In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors.
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.
In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories.
In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected.
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union.
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.
The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women.
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions.
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation.
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.
On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women.
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.
Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota?
Women deserve more than a quota.
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.
Mr President, you may be familiar with the saying: "you can say what you like on paper" .
The same applies to human rights: they are often formulated and written down, yet still they are not upheld in many areas.
Therefore, I have nothing but criticism for many such documents when it comes to women' s rights.
In principle, I believe that, as in other areas, it is only possible to reach solutions in the sphere of women' s policy on the basis of partnership and mutual understanding.
Women' s policy should not be formulated in such a way that it is as if women are working against men, rather women and men must join forces in order to seek and arrive at socio-political solutions.
Turning now to the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities: demands are being made to the effect that a balanced distribution of men and women within the EU institutions should be guaranteed.
Does that mean that a regulation on quotas is to be introduced?
Although a woman, I myself am against quotas, for I do not want to be a token woman.
Rather, I want to be assessed on the basis of my performance and not on the basis of my gender.
I know from experience that many women share this view.
Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth.
I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers.
But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process.
That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life.
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.
First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women.
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.
Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.
May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.
No action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a European framework status for assistant spouses.
Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court.
Do not take too long to send it back.
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.
The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy.
All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule.
If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy.
However, it is also a question of political agendas.
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day.
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time.
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation.
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.
Mr President, before I came here for today' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television.
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."
You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion.
During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.
I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she.
Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.
I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4, to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution.
This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy.
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts, which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society.
Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved.
It is quite logical, it is consistent!
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.
So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say - no, definitely not.
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics.
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women' s participation in the political decision-making process.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, "Women are half of heaven" , a successful man once said.
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices.
Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields.
That is unacceptable in a democracy.
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.
If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required.
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making.
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.
I propose that the EU' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated.
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes.
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.
In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping.
The call for women' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full.
Not to use women' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste.
Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today.
Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world.
In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women.
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies.
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.
The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased.
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.
I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention.
Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece.
I think this is a very sad state of affairs.
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda.
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution.
I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas.
I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result.
It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance.
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off.
Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats.
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas.
Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract.
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.
I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it.
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and, above all, for their proposals.
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.
In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence.
Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace.
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means.
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone.
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community.
Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making?
And how should we achieve this?
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary.
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.
But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided.
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties?
And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties?
Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies?
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.
In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level.
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.
We would, in this way, violate democracy.
.
(PT) Mr President, I am grateful for the liveliness of the debate on this issue, the ways in which it has been addressed and the positions adopted on it in this House.
Members were prepared to discuss rather than simply raise questions and we have heard some valuable insights into the topic being discussed.
We have all recognised that if democracy is to be strengthened, it is crucial for women to have greater decision-making powers and to participate more in the decision-making process.
This was universally acknowledged.
The differences of opinion were about how this objective can be achieved.
When quotas were being discussed, I had the impression that in certain statements made by women Members, the quotas themselves were the objective, and as such, should therefore be opposed.
To my mind, quotas will - as was stated here, moreover - be merely a provisional instrument.
I can tell you what happened in Portugal last year when a law on quotas for party lists was discussed.
This government bill was rejected by our parliament, and all our political leaders stated that quotas were unnecessary because, of course, women and their skills were essential in strengthening the democratic process, so in the imminent elections the lists would reflect the need to take advantage of women' s skills.
The lists were published, the elections were held, Parliament was convened and only one group, the Greens, which has just two women MPs, fulfilled the commitment that they had all given, and exceeded it at that.
This is the reality of the situation.
I do not think that anyone in this House feels that quotas are a positive thing, but they are perhaps a necessary stage in the process, not because men do not acknowledge women' s competence, but because positions that women deserve to hold have, for a long time, been occupied by men.
Furthermore, it is difficult to take people off the final lists in cases where a certain personal fondness may be involved.
This is one problem.
Another problem is the fact that women are not generally interested in participating in politics.
Women obviously find it hard to be interested in taking part in politics as they have much less time available to them than men and as the organisation of the political parties, which is thoroughly male-oriented, serves as an excuse for time continuing to mean different things for men and women.
If a political party holds a meeting in the evening and the man cannot go home because he has to attend as he is a member of the party' s executive, that is seen as a good reason for the man not to go home to play his part in the household chores, which are also his responsibility.
Therefore, until there is a change in this idea of sharing, sharing the responsibilities that the right to have a family implies, obviously nothing will change in terms of women being able to participate in the political process.
Indeed, we are still suffering from problems whose causes we have not yet resolved.
However, in order to find these solutions, we need measures for positive action which contribute to them.
One woman Member of this Parliament said that this problem must not become a battle of the sexes.
I too agree that it should not be a question of war between men and women, because thinking men and women who are genuine democrats agree that we would be justified in considering that the present situation does not reflect a genuine, representative democracy.
I therefore fail to understand what the problem with quotas is, given that in principle, they will only be used as an instrument in countries where women are under-represented and where these draft laws have been approved in parliaments where, by definition, men are in the majority.
If they approve these laws, it is because this process is about consensus, not imposition, nor is it a battle of the sexes.
So I think that all this needs to be studied and debated.
We need to know whether it is worth continuing to wait for decades until this process resolves itself naturally by means of an increase in the numbers of women in higher education, at universities, and in their economic and social power.
This might finally happen unaided in approximately the third millennium.
Or perhaps, on the other hand, we are already in a position today, thanks to the use of procedures such as benchmarking and statistical information gathering, for assessing how positive the results are in terms of good practice, and we have what we need to build the very thing we all claim to believe in: a democratic and pluralist society based on balanced participation by men and women.
These measures for positive and balanced action respecting people' s dignity must be adopted in various areas.
At the moment, we are not taking advantage of women' s dignity, usefulness, competence, their vision of the world, their knowledge, their ways of being, knowing and acting, and these qualities are being completely wasted across all social, institutional, economic and political processes.
The presidency is therefore extremely keen to support initiatives designed to radically change this situation, even if it has to use transitional instruments which have already proved to be the only way to achieve the objective of balanced representation in decision-making processes.
The presidency is extremely anxious and entirely committed to support these methods, not as objectives in themselves but as a means to an end.
Today, figures are available which show us the reality, which reveal the enormous disparities in this area between the various countries that constitute the EU and we are therefore fully briefed about the situation.
It seems to be a universally acknowledged fact that greater involvement of women is essential.
Instruments are available to us which can provide a more balanced division of tasks between men and women, so that they can reconcile their private and professional lives.
We must therefore make use of whatever instruments for positive action we may need in order to change the current state of affairs.
Mr President, today' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe.
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture.
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres.
The debate is a deeply political one.
There are two approaches.
The first is a policy of persuasion.
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved.
Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able.
I can, therefore all women can.
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded?
We are able but the rest of the female population is not?
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics.
Because women have to deal with different realities.
Because they have fewer opportunities.
Because they have a different level of education.
Because they have to face social obstacles.
Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest.
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders.
Not necessary!
They have all been persuaded!
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women.
There is not one party, from the far left to the far right, which does not stress the need for women to take part.
On paper!
Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually.
The women' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light.
With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level, it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women.
As far as Europe is concerned, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, where there is a quota for the involvement of women, it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation.
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women.
Quotas alone are not enough.
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history.
On this we are clear.
Quotas are one of the ways, one of the policies needed to bring about change.
Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow morning.
Floods in Mozambique
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique.
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.
The Commission is following with very great concern, as I know all honourable Members will be, the emergency situation in Mozambique.
The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure.
About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods, about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance.
Several people have lost their lives, many have disappeared, many have been injured.
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries.
The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance.
My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground.
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission.
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far, perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks.
First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique.
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems, with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war.
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique.
Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society.
Thirdly, we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention, how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively.
We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and, if I may say so, if ever there was a case where that is relevant, it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique.
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far.
Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief, of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg, for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross.
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation.
ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending, of course, the reception and examination of their final proposals.
These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation, provision of shelter, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, blankets, those sorts of things.
They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people, on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases, on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk, on the provision of seeds and tools, on food security, on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters.
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson.
The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve.
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon.
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent.
I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity.
I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy.
The credit for Mozambique' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique.
There is a risk, however, that all the effort that has been made in recent years, after all the problems with the peace agreements, with which we are all familiar, will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks.
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them.
There have already been hundreds of deaths.
The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa.
It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters, followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid.
Although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in: there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in.
This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment: search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid.
I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing.
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods.
It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way.
Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial, because otherwise there can be no development.
It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique' s debts.
If nothing is done now, we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste.
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves.
Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions.
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died, we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops.
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics, which have apparently already broken out, and aid for reconstruction.
However, the aid needed now is difficult to get through, despite the efforts of the NGOs, because the roads, bridges and railway lines are damaged.
Helicopters are therefore needed.
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees.
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow.
The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters, including preventing conflicts, is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique.
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term.
The European Commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as DIPECHO.
This was intended to be proactive and, using a regional approach, to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population.
However, Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans.
Mozambique, which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster, just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable, is excluded from these plans.
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean.
This is reasonable and we support this, but we have to ask the Commissioner, why not Africa?
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission' s humanitarian aid policy.
We have always supported ECHO, its policies and its actions, even some which have been disputed by certain bodies.
We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU' s external action.
In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique.
The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars.
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency.
We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique.
Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency.
Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives.
There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims.
The water levels continue to rise.
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable.
It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly.
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness.
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today.
In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late.
Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far.
What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast?
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of?
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far?
Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner?
The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential.
Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique.
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed.
And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary.
It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help.
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique.
We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately.
This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires.
Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.
Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment, and only international solidarity can save them.
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us.
Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising, first of all, the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique.
Indeed, these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their possessions, people who cannot return to their homes after the storms, purely and simply because their homes and their belongings no longer exist.
They are no longer there, having been swept away in the torrents.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remains, however, one immediate problem: the need to provide help for all Mozambicans who have been afflicted, many of whose lives are in danger, in their flooded villages, hoping that they will be rescued.
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft, especially helicopters, of which it is clear that too few are in action.
As the President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, remarked in a dramatic appeal, each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans.
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively, in terms of quantity as well as quality, and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this.
We must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity, but also - and quickly - because we know that Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world.
This means that its resources for coping with the tragedy and then setting about reconstruction are practically non-existent.
We are also under an obligation to help because of another fact, the fact that Mozambique is one of the few African countries to have used democratic means to recover from the bloody civil war by which it was consumed for several years after it gained independence.
It is true that Mozambique' s democracy is still far from perfect, as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them.
But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House' s attention - which was not really necessary, but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique.
I have some figures here, which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available.
More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs.
As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid.
Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods.
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all.
The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake.
I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development.
.
Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking.
Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything.
But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness.
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place.
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region.
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet.
85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is.
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing.
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million.
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there.
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift.
As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets.
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources.
Are we ready to pay for those resources?
Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures.
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured.
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country.
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.
Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
Union Economy (1999)
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].
The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001.
This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate.
It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy.
This is the challenge.
Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.
In Europe, in your rapporteur' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly.
Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing.
These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates.
Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn?
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.
One is to adopt the Commission' s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible.
A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector.
To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows.
It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact.
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.
The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit.
It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail.
Unfortunately my colleagues of the People' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable.
I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long.
It is certainly not my task to judge other people' s alliances but if the People' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them.
I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra.
Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy, something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation.
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects.
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.
Mr President, firstly I would like to say how pleased I am that my friend Giorgos Katiforis is still able to muster so much enthusiasm for this very important subject so late in the evening.
I would be more than pleased to accede to his request, but first and foremost, I would like to begin with the analysis.
Surely the first question we must ask ourselves is: how is the European Union' s economic policy proceeding at the moment, or rather, how is the economic policy of the eleven Member States proceeding at present, for that is what it all revolves around after all?
We have asked experts about this and they gave very interesting answers.
However, I believe that the most important judges as to whether a country is pursuing sound or poor economic policy are currently the international financial markets and developments that are then reflected in the exchange rates.
In which connection, we know that the euro is weak against the dollar; in other words, the international markets have given a poor assessment of the economic policy currently being pursued by the eleven Member States of the European Union whose currency is the euro.
Why should this be so?
Is it down to the European Central Bank?
Definitely not.
The European Union is in good financial shape.
The European Central Bank has all the instruments at its disposal that a central bank could wish for.
The European Central Bank is headed by convincing personalities.
They have also fulfilled their task of monitoring price stability and the interest rate policies they have pursued have been completely in line with this task.
So it cannot be down to the European Central Bank.
Is it down to the forecasts concerning growth and employment in the coming years?
The forecasts are absolutely excellent.
It is forecast that economic growth will run at 3%, as compared with 1.9% in the 90s.
Unemployment is expected to fall, albeit slowly.
Price stability in the European Union is better in the eleven Member States than it is in the United States.
We have price stability, inflation running at less than 2%.
Long-term interest rates are also lower than they are in the United States.
The real reason why the European countries are not finding favour is the fact that we are too slow in tackling the structural reform Europe needs.
First and foremost, there is the flexibility of labour markets.
We are aware that unemployment has fallen more quickly in those countries, including EU Member States, which have made their labour markets more flexible, than it has in other countries.
In some countries unemployment is now below 5%.
Then there is the major undertaking of reforming the social security systems and adapting them to the requirements of a European home market - here too, we in Europe are lagging far behind.
There is also a need to improve conditions for research and development: firstly, there is technophobia within the European Union, which certainly hampers research and development in the EU.
Coupled with this is the fact that the protection of intellectual property here in Europe, particularly for small and medium-sized firms - and they are especially creative - is too expensive and does not operate adequately.
I also believe that, as matters stand with regard to electronic money, we are about to miss out on opportunities that other countries are already exploiting as we speak, because we are taking too long to adapt the framework conditions.
We are also failing to adapt our training systems in good time.
For example, if there is currently demand in Germany for electronics experts to be brought into the European Union from other countries, then this only goes to show that our own training systems have failed and that they have not been equipped to deal with the requirements of the information society in good time.
In other words, things are moving too slowly.
The adjustments that need to be made with regard to dismantling monopolies are proceeding too slowly as well.
We have come a relatively long way as far as telecommunications is concerned.
We still fall a long way short on the postal services front and there is also still a lot to be done in terms of dismantling monopolies in the energy sector.
What is more, we have reason to fear that, in some sectors, private monopolies could replace the old public monopolies, which would mean that, in terms of competition, and in terms of what benefits the public most, we would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.
But now perhaps a few words on the fundamental difference between our opinion and that of the rapporteur.
The rapporteur believes in growth and stimulating demand.
He regards this as a panacea.
Alongside the many issues where our opinions do not differ to anything like the same extent, this is what stood out from the rapporteur' s proposals.
I believe it would not be totally wide of the mark to describe his stance on this issue as belonging to the old Keynesian school of thought.
By contrast, we take the view that this kind of economic policy would be lop-sided, and that we should give attention not only to stimulating demand, but also to supply conditions and the structural reforms I have just mentioned.
We must set to work on these now, for only then will we be able to hold our own in the face of global competition.
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the comprehensive, extremely important and highly informative work that he has carried out.
I would like to re-emphasise the value of the extensive deliberations that we had in committee with the experts, who, fortunately for us, made themselves available to Parliament.
These experts were most emphatic about how important it is to take investment-related measures and to employ demand-orientated instruments.
By that, I do not think they mean what you have just termed the Keynesian school of thought of yesteryear, Mr von Wogau, for no one wants a lack of stability or solidity, rather we must at last find the right policy mix here in the European Union.
This involves both supply- and demand-orientated measures.
We see this in other countries of the world that have been pursuing this very strategy for many years now, and which are more successful than your homeland, for example.
I am certainly not overly pessimistic with regard to the prospects for the European Union.
After all, we can see that after a year of economic and monetary union in the European Union, the economy has undergone a distinct recovery.
The Commission' s annual report on the economy is right to anticipate positive trends.
After all, the global economic and political conditions are favourable, they just have to be utilised.
We must at long last resolve to coordinate things in such a way that we create real synergy of the kind that will actually facilitate a high level of sustainable growth for many years to come.
I must say that this business with the euro-dollar exchange rate does not worry me, not just because I see potential here for revaluation of the euro, no, because the euro-dollar exchange rate is giving the European export economy an additional boost, thereby underpinning its role as a driving force in the economy during an important phase of European economic development.
As I said before, the European Union still lacks a common growth strategy, which would be instrumental in enabling us to actually use the interdependence of the EU national economies to best advantage, and in enabling the internal market to function to optimum effect
This does not just have to do with the fact that there is still a lack of structural reform.
Of course, it is important for us to undertake structural reform.
But has anyone ever calculated the economic impact of this structural reform, to enable us to see what it could actually contribute in the way of growth, investment and employment?
Seen in this light, we cannot dispense with structured growth.
I think it is a shame that even now, not all participants in the macroeconomic dialogue see the need for coordination.
We simply must be aware that we are still not free of external risks, and European growth, growth within the EU, is still subject to internal risks.
At the end of the day, there are, for example, indicators here in the European Union that show that growth and its prospects are by no means as solid as they were in the 80s.
This also has something to do with confidence.
I do not believe that we should leave it to the financial markets to pass judgement, but we must ensure that both consumers and manufacturing gain in confidence where development in the European Union is concerned.
There is also a need for a common European approach - I would not dispute this - in the development of wage policy, which, I believe, has already been brought into line in the EU, in exemplary fashion, with the productivity and inflation objectives of the ECB.
It should not boil down to a renationalisation of the fight against inflation at Member State level, this fight being waged due to the pressure exerted by increased oil and raw materials prices.
An independent evaluation of European economic policy will be of importance to the European Union and to structured growth.
What we need is an annual report on the economic and social situation in the Union, so as to enable us to develop an EU policy with benchmarking and specific quantitative and qualitative figures and objectives for investment and growth.
This must be incorporated into the cornerstones of economic policy.
It is my belief that, at the end of the day, any violation of this policy must be followed up by a detailed analysis of causes with regard to the respective national economy.
Of course, the benefits arising from favourable economic growth should now be put to use in helping to alleviate structural shortfalls more intensely, and rightly so.
However, the benefits of growth should also be used for investment in the information society, and in research and development, as well as in that expensive raw material 'labour' .
Measures including Internet access in every school or lifelong learning would constitute a sound approach in this respect - which even opponents of state expenditure programmes would have to agree to - so as to secure future prospects and full employment for the citizens of the Union.
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report.
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee.
We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence.
Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent.
Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus.
They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU' s population growth.
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years.
It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy.
In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures.
Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level.
However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws.
There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high.
This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600.
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention.
It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union.
Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union.
This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe.
There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe.
The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message.
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report?
First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires.
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions.
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.
Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth.
And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things.
Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital.
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.
Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers.
The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union.
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union.
Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support.
With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers' employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job.
Our Group categorically condemns this perception and, in this sense, does not intend to support this resolution.
It will be voting against it.
Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow.
Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past.
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps.
We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies.
But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency.
In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances.
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report.
But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation.
If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro.
Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions.
Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial.
Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising.
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy.
Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it.
Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy.
More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity.
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes.
If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future.
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd.
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level.
If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again.
What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.
Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy.
Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy.
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.
Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs.
However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution.
Mr President, although affronted by the fact that 14 Member States have prejudged Austria, I will now take a stance on the Katiforis report.
There is still a lack of optimism and also confidence in Europe, which we need if we are to think at all seriously in terms of positive economic development.
The reasons for this, as far as I am concerned, are manifold.
In Europe we have taxation systems that impede performance.
The average level of income tax is over 50% in Europe.
The very brave step taken by the Reagan administration in the 80s showed how a dramatic reduction in the level of taxation, from 70% to 28% that is, was able to stabilise the USA' s budget with lasting effect.
And the tax revenue from top earners did not fall when this reduction took place, rather the reverse happened.
In 1984, tax revenue from top earners actually rose from 17.6%, the level it was at in 1980, to 25.6%.
We in Europe should also find the courage to introduce a low-level taxation system.
Alongside this reason, however, other significant reasons lie behind the fact that economic development in Europe is not proceeding apace.
The barrage of legislation in Europe, coupled with over-complicated laws, has produced so much red tape that, in the end, it takes 11 weeks in effect to set up a company in Europe while it takes 10 days in the USA.
Surveys carried out at European universities have shown that 60% of students intend to seek work in the public sector and only 40% in the private sector.
We need more competition in Europe, particularly where the new technologies are concerned, so that objectives such as full employment and growth can be secured and sustained.
Mr President, we are undoubtedly making progress where the coordination of economic and monetary policy is concerned.
More flexible labour markets, new technologies, and securing market niches and better framework conditions for the establishment of innovative and creative enterprises, are all crucial to the European economy.
In terms of monetary policy, we are talking balanced budgets, low inflation and the development of a culture of stability.
The interests of both employer and employee coincide here.
However, it is not workable, at present, to synchronise economic and monetary policy with social policy, and that includes common, quantitative goals.
We PPE-DE Members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have made it clear on numerous occasions that the annual activity reports submitted by the Member States at least appear to be more topical, even though they continue to be produced on an individual basis.
A first, yet crucial step, would be to bring about convergence in social policy.
This would include a benchmarking procedure, with the exchange of comparable data and a shift of emphasis from action plans to the fight against exclusion and poverty.
It would be equally appropriate to streamline the various procedures adopted at Cardiff, Luxembourg and Cologne.
I only hope that we do not end up with a fourth, i.e. what is known as the Lisbon method.
We have enough labels, but not enough content.
Simplification, not complication, is what is called for.
If we are to improve social conditions then what we need are quality-orientated endeavours, such as more training and further education opportunities, so as to broaden the skills' base, and ensure an appropriate level of social protection and worker participation in profit and capital distribution.
There is a need to evaluate the annual progress, or lack of it, made by Member States in the fight against unemployment, and to take the necessary countermeasures.
The European Parliament must have greater involvement in this process.
We have made a start, with measures ranging from Employment Week in November, through to involving the two sides of industry and the NGOs, to our debates in plenary, which are completely open to public scrutiny.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us.
Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports.
In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones.
The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns.
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report?
He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve.
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets.
Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%?
An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive.
As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training.
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce.
I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average.
What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues.
Mr President, I can appreciate that Mr Katiforis has difficulties with the argumentation but, in my view, this is a good report with a sensible analysis.
It is said that things are going better for Europe but, when people say this, we must nonetheless be clear about the fact that matters still look extremely different from one individual Member State to another.
Europe' s major problem is still unemployment.
In my view, it is simply not on to say that things are going well for Europe when between 16 and 17 million Europeans are without work.
Why is the European economy not growing sufficiently?
Why is the euro so much weaker than the dollar?
I do not think that we ought to derive all our inspiration, without exception, from the United States but I am convinced that we have things to learn from the States, for example, about having fewer rules in the labour market, lower social costs and lower taxes.
We also have something to learn regarding the possibility of starting up new companies.
There is a different commercial climate in the United States than in Europe.
We have heard about the costs and the bureaucracy involved in starting up a new company, about the fact that it costs EUR
1 600 in Europe but only EUR 500 in the United States to do so and about the fact that it takes eleven weeks in the EU but only ten days in the United States.
It cannot continue like that.
I think Mr Katiforis also appreciates the fact.
Europe must become more competitive.
In a very interesting annex to the present report, Mr Richard Layard cites a number of countries as models, namely Great Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark where welfare dependency and unemployment have declined.
Mr Layard highlights the difficulties experienced by the long-term unemployed.
That is what differentiates us from the United States.
In Europe, we pay people for not doing anything.
That does not happen in the United States.
Europe therefore needs another type of policy, not an American-style policy in every respect but one which takes us away from welfare dependency, which gives people the opportunity of a good education suited to the new jobs in the market, which makes it easier to start up new companies, which improves the commercial climate and which ensures that new techniques and ideas are exploited to the full.
As Europeans, we can achieve a lot if we are afforded the opportunity.
