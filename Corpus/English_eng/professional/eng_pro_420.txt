Annotated list
Opening of the session by the President of the General Assembly1
In accordance with rule 1 of the rules of procedure (A/520/Rev.15 and Amend.1 and 2, as amended by the General Assembly in resolution 57/301 of 13 March 2003), the General Assembly shall meet every year in regular session commencing on the Tuesday of the third week in September, counting from the first week that contains at least one working day.
The sixtieth session of the General Assembly will open on Tuesday, 13 September 2005.
At its fifty-sixth session, by its resolution 56/509 of 8 July 2002, the General Assembly amended rules 30 and 31 of its rules of procedure.
The amended rule 31 provides that if, at the opening of a session of the General Assembly, the President for that session has not yet been elected, in accordance with the amended rule 30, the President of the previous session, or the chairman of that delegation from which the President of the previous session was elected, shall preside until the Assembly has elected a President.
When rule 31 is applied, the temporary President is not necessarily the individual who presided at the preceding session.
The sixtieth session of the General Assembly will be opened by the President for that session.
(For the election of the President, see item 4.
Minute of silent prayer or meditation
Rule 62 of the rules of procedure provides that, immediately after the opening of the 1st plenary meeting and immediately preceding the closing of the final plenary meeting of each session of the General Assembly, the President shall invite the representatives to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation.
This provision was incorporated in the rules of procedure at the fourth session (resolution 362 (IV), annex I).
Credentials of representatives to the sixtieth session of the General Assembly
(a) Appointment of the members of the Credentials Committee
(b) Report of the Credentials Committee2
In accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure, the credentials of representatives and the names of members of a delegation are to be submitted to the Secretary-General, if possible not less than one week before the opening of the session.
The credentials must be issued either by the Head of State or Government or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Under rule 28 of the rules of procedure, a Credentials Committee consisting of nine members is appointed by the General Assembly at the beginning of each session on the proposal of the President.
The members of the Committee are traditionally appointed at the 1st plenary meeting, on the proposal of the President.
The Committee elects a Chairman, but no Vice-Chairman or Rapporteur.
On completion of its work, the Committee submits a report to the General Assembly.
At its fifty-ninth session, the General Assembly appointed the following States members of the Credentials Committee: Benin, Bhutan, China, Ghana, Liechtenstein, Russian Federation, Trinidad and Tobago, United States of America and Uruguay (decision 59/401).
At that session, the Assembly approved the report of the Committee (resolution 59/208).

Election of the President of the General Assembly3
At its fifty-sixth session, by its resolution 56/509 of 8 July 2002, the General Assembly amended rule 303 of its rules of procedure.
Under the amended rule 30, the General Assembly shall elect a President at least three months before the opening of the session over which the President is to preside.
The President so elected will assume the functions only at the beginning of that session for which the President is elected and shall hold office until the close of that session.
On 13 June 2005, the General Assembly elected by acclamation its President for the sixtieth session (decision 59/421).
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election is held by secret ballot and there are no nominations.
The President is elected by a simple majority.
It should be noted, however, that since the thirty-second session, with the exception of the thirty-sixth, thirty-eighth and forty-sixth sessions, the President has been elected by acclamation.
At its thirty-third session, in 1978, the General Assembly decided (resolution 33/138, annex, para.
1) that, in the election of the President, regard should be had for equitable geographical rotation of the office among the following States:
(a) African States;
(b) Asian States;
(c) Eastern European States;
(d) Latin American States;
(e) Western European or other States.
At its thirty-fourth session, the General Assembly decided that the practice of dispensing with the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs when the number of candidates corresponded to the number of seats to be filled should become standard and the same practice should apply to the election of the President of the Assembly, unless a delegation specifically requested a vote on a given election (decision 34/401, para.
The names of the past Presidents of the General Assembly are listed in annex I.
References for the fifty-ninth session (agenda item 4)
Election of the officers of the Main Committees3
The General Assembly has six Main Committees.
At its forty-seventh session, by its resolution 47/233 of 17 August 1993, the Assembly decided to amend rule 98 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly according to paragraph 1 of the resolution, which reads as follows:
“1.
Decides that the Main Committees of the General Assembly shall be as follows:
(a) Disarmament and International Security Committee (First Committee);
(b) Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee);
(c) Economic and Financial Committee (Second Committee);
(d) Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee (Third Committee);
(e) Administrative and Budgetary Committee (Fifth Committee);
(f) Legal Committee (Sixth Committee).”
At its fifty-second session, the General Assembly decided to amend the first sentence of rule 103 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly to read: “Each Main Committee shall elect a Chairman, three Vice-Chairmen and a Rapporteur” (resolution 52/163, para.
Rule 103 states that the elections shall be held by secret ballot unless the Committee decides otherwise in an election where only one candidate is standing.
Since in the great majority of cases only one candidate is nominated, most officers of Main Committees are elected by acclamation.
In addition, rule 103 provides that the nomination of each candidate shall be limited to one speaker, after which the Committee shall immediately proceed to the election.
Rule 99 (a), as amended by the General Assembly in resolution 56/509 of 8 July 2002, stipulates that all the Main Committees shall, at least three months before the opening of the session, elect a Chairman and that elections of the other officers provided for in rule 103 shall be held at the latest by the end of the first week of the session.
In accordance with resolution 58/126 of 19 December 2003, the full Bureaux of the Main Committees shall also be elected three months in advance of the next session.
On 13 June 2005, the six Main Committees elected their respective officers for the sixtieth session.
The elections of the officers of the Main Committees are held in consecutive meetings of the six Main Committees, immediately following the election of the President of the General Assembly in plenary meeting.
On 13 June 2005, at the 102nd plenary meeting, the President of the General Assembly announced the names of the persons who had been elected Chairmen of the Main Committees of the Assembly for the sixtieth session (decision 59/422).
At its forty-eighth session, the General Assembly decided, on 29 July 1994 (resolution 48/264, annex II), that the six Chairmen of the Main Committees should be elected according to the following pattern:
(a) One representative from an African State;
(b) One representative from an Asian State;
(c) One representative from an Eastern European State;
(d) One representative from a Latin American or Caribbean State;
(e) One representative from a Western European or other State;
(f) The sixth chairmanship shall rotate over a period of 20 sessions according to the following pattern:
(i) One representative from an African State;
(ii) One representative from an Asian State;
(iii) One representative from a Latin American or Caribbean State;

Election of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly3
The President of the General Assembly is assisted by 21 Vice-Presidents.
The duties involved are performed by heads of delegations of Member States, and not by individuals elected in their personal capacity.
The Assembly decided on four occasions to increase the number of Vice-Presidents (resolutions 1104 (XI), 1192 (XII), 1990 (XVIII) and 33/138).
At its fifty-sixth session, by its resolution 56/509 of 8 July 2002, the General Assembly amended rule 303 of its rules of procedure.
Under the amended rule 30, the General Assembly shall elect 21 Vice-Presidents at least three months before the opening of the session over which they are to preside.
The Vice-Presidents so elected will assume the functions only at the beginning of the session for which they are elected and shall hold office until the close of that session.
On 13 June 2005, the General Assembly elected its Vice-Presidents for the sixtieth session (decision 59/423).
In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election is held by secret ballot and there are no nominations.
Vice-Presidents are elected by a simple majority.
It should be noted, however, that since the thirty-second session, with the exception of the thirty-sixth, thirty-eighth, forty-first and forty-second sessions in the case of one of the regional groups, the Vice-Presidents have been elected by acclamation.
The amended rule 30 provides that the Vice-Presidents shall be elected after the election of the Chairmen of the Main Committees (see item 5), in such a way as to ensure the representative character of the General Committee (see item 7).
At its thirty-third session, in 1978, the General Assembly decided (resolution 33/138, annex, para.
2) that the 21 Vice-Presidents should be elected according to the following pattern:
(a) Six representatives from African States;
(b) Five representatives from Asian States;
(c) One representative from an Eastern European State;
(d) Three representatives from Latin American States;
(e) Two representatives from Western European or other States;
(f) Five representatives from the permanent members of the Security Council.
The election of the President of the Assembly has the effect, however, of reducing by one the number of vice-presidencies allocated to the region from which the President is elected (resolution 33/138, annex, para.
At its thirty-fourth session, the General Assembly decided that the practice of dispensing with the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs when the number of candidates corresponded to the number of seats to be filled should become standard and the same practice should apply to the election of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, unless a delegation specifically requested a vote on a given election (decision 34/401, para.
The names of the States that have held the office of Vice-President of the General Assembly are listed in annex III.

General debate
At the beginning of the session, the General Assembly devotes a period of two weeks to the general debate, during which heads of delegations may state the views of their Governments on any item before the Assembly.
However, in accordance with resolution 58/126 of 19 December 2003, in June of each year, the President-elect of the General Assembly, after taking into account the views provided by Member States and following consultations with the incumbent President and the Secretary-General, will suggest an issue, or issues, of global concern upon which Member States will be invited to comment during the general debate.
By its resolution 57/301 of 13 March 2003, the General Assembly decided that the general debate should open on the Tuesday following the opening of the regular session of the General Assembly and should be held without interruption over a period of nine working days.
At its fifty-ninth session, taking into account that the High-level Plenary Meeting of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly will be held from 14 to 16 September 2005, the General Assembly decided to hold the general debate at its sixtieth session from Saturday, 17 September, to Friday, 23 September, and from Monday, 26 September, to Wednesday, 28 September 2005, on the understanding that these arrangements should in no way create a precedent for the general debate at future sessions (resolution 59/145).
At the fifty-ninth session, 15 plenary meetings were devoted to the general debate (A/59/PV.3-17, during which 192 speakers took the floor.

The Security Council (see item 112 (a)) submits an annual report to the General Assembly under Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter and the Assembly considers the report in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 1.
The Council's report is included in the provisional agenda of the Assembly pursuant to rule 13 (b) of the rules of procedure.
The General Assembly usually takes note of the report of the Security Council without discussion.
However, at its twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh sessions, in 1971 and 1972, the Assembly, in connection with its consideration of the Council's report, decided to seek the views of Member States on ways and means of enhancing the effectiveness of the Council in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Charter (resolutions 2864 (XXVI) and 2991 (XXVII)).
At its twenty-eighth session, the Assembly drew the attention of the Council, when considering steps to enhance its effectiveness in accordance with the principles and provisions of the Charter, to the views and suggestions submitted by Member States in response to the above-mentioned resolutions as contained in the Secretary-General's reports on the matter (A/8447 and Add.1 and A/9243) (resolution 3186 (XXVIII)).
At its fifty-first session, the Assembly invited the Security Council, through an appropriate procedure or mechanism, to update the General Assembly on a regular basis on the steps it had taken or was contemplating with respect to improving its reporting to the Assembly (resolution 51/193).

The situation in the Middle East2
Various aspects of the situation in the Middle East have been dealt with by the United Nations, particularly by the General Assembly and the Security Council, since 1947.
Following the hostilities of June 1967, the Security Council, in November 1967, set forth principles for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East (resolution 242 (1967)).
The General Assembly considered the item on the situation in the Middle East at its twenty-fifth to twenty-seventh sessions from 1970 to 1972 (resolutions 2628 (XXV), 2799 (XXVI) and 2949 (XXVII)), and at its thirtieth to fifty-eighth sessions, from 1975 to 2003 (resolutions 3414 (XXX), 31/61, 31/62, 32/20, 33/29, 34/70, 35/207, 36/226 A and B, 37/123 A to F, 38/180 A to E, 39/146 A to C, 40/168 A to C, 41/162 A to C, 42/209 A to D, 43/54 A to C, 44/40 A to C, 45/83 A to C, 46/82 A and B, 47/63 A and B, 48/58, 48/59 A and B, 49/87 A and B, 49/88, 50/21, 50/22 A to C, 51/27 to 51/29, 52/53, 52/54, 53/37, 53/38, 54/37, 54/38, 55/50, 55/51, 56/31, 56/32, 57/111, 57/112, 58/22 and 58/23).
At its fifty-ninth session, the General Assembly reiterated its determination that any actions taken by Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem were illegal and therefore null and void; deplored the transfer by some States of their diplomatic missions to Jerusalem in violation of Security Council resolution 478 (1980), and called once more upon those States to abide by the provisions of the relevant United Nations resolutions; and requested the Secretary-General to report to the Assembly at its sixtieth session on the implementation of the resolution (resolution 59/32).
At the same session, the General Assembly declared that Israel had failed so far to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981); also declared that the Israeli decision of 14 December 1981 to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was null and void and had no validity whatsoever, as confirmed by the Security Council in its resolution 497 (1981), and called upon Israel to rescind it; determined once more that the continued occupation of the Syrian Golan and its de facto annexation constituted a stumbling block in the way of achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region; called upon Israel to resume the talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks and to respect the commitments and undertakings reached during the previous talks; demanded once more that Israel withdraw from all the occupied Syrian Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 in implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions; and requested the Secretary-General to report to the Assembly at its sixtieth session on the implementation of the resolution (resolution 59/33).

At that session, the Assembly invited the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the representative of the Palestinian people, to participate in its deliberations on the question of Palestine in plenary meetings (resolution 3210 (XXIX)).
At the same session, the Assembly reaffirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in Palestine, emphasizing that their realization was indispensable for the solution of the question of Palestine (resolution 3236 (XXIX)).
The Assembly also invited the PLO to participate, in the capacity of observer, in its sessions and its work and in all international conferences convened under its auspices; and considered that the PLO was similarly entitled with regard to all international conferences convened by other organs of the United Nations (resolution 3237 (XXIX)).
At its thirtieth session, the General Assembly called for the invitation of the PLO to participate on an equal footing with other parties in all efforts, deliberations and conferences on the Middle East that were held under the auspices of the United Nations and to take part in the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East as well as in all other efforts for peace (resolution 3375 (XXX)).
At the same session, the Assembly established the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People; requested the Committee to consider and recommend to the Assembly a programme of implementation, designed to enable the Palestinian people to exercise the rights previously recognized; and requested the Security Council to consider the question of the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights (resolution 3376 (XXX)).
At its thirty-first and subsequent sessions, the General Assembly endorsed the recommendations of the Committee (resolutions 31/20, 32/40 A, 33/28 A, 34/65 A, 35/169 A, 36/120 A, 37/86 A, 38/58 A, 39/49 A, 40/96 A, 41/43 A, 42/66 A, 43/175 A, 44/41 A, 45/67 A, 46/74 A, 47/64 A, 48/158 A, 49/62 A, 50/84 A, 51/23, 52/49, 53/39, 54/39, 55/52 and 56/33).

At its thirty-second session, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to establish within the Secretariat a Special Unit on Palestinian Rights, which would prepare, under the Committee's guidance, studies and publications relating to the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and would organize, in consultation with the Committee, commencing in 1978, the annual observance of 29 November as the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People (resolution 32/40 B).
The Assembly later requested that the Special Unit be redesignated as the Division for Palestinian Rights, with an expanded mandate of work.
At its forty-third session, the General Assembly acknowledged the proclamation of the State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council on 15 November 1988; affirmed the need to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their sovereignty over their territory occupied since 1967; and decided that, effective as at 15 December 1988, the designation “Palestine” should be used in place of the designation “Palestine Liberation Organization” in the United Nations system, without prejudice to the observer status and functions of the PLO within the United Nations system, in conformity with relevant United Nations resolutions and practice (resolution 43/177).
At its fifty-ninth session, the General Assembly considered that the special information programme on the question of Palestine of the Department of Public Information of the Secretariat was very useful in raising the awareness of the international community concerning the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East; and requested the Department to continue its special information programme for the biennium 2004-2005 (resolution 59/30).
At the same session, the General Assembly, recalling the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and also its resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004, reaffirmed the necessity of achieving a peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine, the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, in all its aspects, and of intensifying all efforts towards that end; called upon both parties to fulfil their obligations in implementation of the road map by taking parallel and reciprocal steps in that regard, and stressed the importance and urgency of establishing a credible and effective third-party monitoring mechanism including all members of the Quartet; called upon the parties, with the support of the Quartet and other interested parties, to exert all efforts necessary to halt the deterioration of the situation, to reverse all measures taken on the ground since 28 September 2000 and to facilitate a speedy resumption of the peace process and the conclusion of a final peaceful settlement; demanded that Israel, the occupying Power, comply with its legal obligations, as mentioned in the advisory opinion, and called upon all States Members of the United Nations to comply with their legal obligations as mentioned in the advisory opinion; reaffirmed its commitment to the two-State solution of Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, based on the pre-1967 borders; stressed the need for (a) the withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, and (b) the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, primarily the right to self-determination and the right to their independent State; also stressed the need for resolving the problem of the Palestine refugees in conformity with its resolution 194 (III); urged Member States to expedite the provision of economic, humanitarian and technical assistance to the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority during that critical period to help to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people, rebuild the Palestinian economy and infrastructure and support the restructuring and reform of Palestinian institutions; and requested the Secretary-General to continue his efforts with the parties concerned, and in consultation with the Security Council, towards the attainment of a peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the promotion of peace in the region and to submit to the Assembly at its sixtieth session a report on those efforts and on developments on the matter (resolution 59/31).
