Item 99 (c) of the provisional agenda*
Review and implementation of the Concluding Document of the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly
United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Introduction
In its resolution 59/99 of 3 December 2004, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to provide the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean with all necessary support, within existing resources, so that it might carry out its programme of activities in accordance with its mandate and to report to the Assembly at its sixtieth session on the implementation of the resolution.
The present report is submitted pursuant to that request and covers the Centre's activities from July 2004 to June 2005.
A financial statement on the status of the Trust Fund for the Centre for 2004 is contained in annex I.
An outline of some planned activities of the Centre for which funding is being sought is provided in annex II.
Functioning and mandate
The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, located in Lima, was established in 1987, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 41/60 J of 3 December 1986.
The Centre functions under the auspices of the Department for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat and is mandated to provide, upon request, substantive support for the initiatives and other activities of the Member States of the region for the implementation of measures for peace and disarmament and for the promotion of economic and social development.
Activities
The Centre has undergone a marked evolution since its creation in 1986, which is evident when contrasting the Centre's initial role as primarily a disarmament information centre in its early years with its subsequent and current role as a catalyst, platform and service provider for States in the region.
The current roles undertaken by the Centre address the increasing requests of States for assistance and aim at integrating the Centre's assistance efforts into those of the United Nations country team in Peru, such as the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, and the goals of the Millennium Declaration.
In addition to assuming the role as a regional focal point for the United Nations Coordinating Action on Small Arms (CASA) mechanism, the Centre has experienced exponential growth in requests for disarmament- and development-related assistance, as well as an increase in the coordination, cooperation and integration of its assistance with those of regional and subregional organizations and with those of governmental and non-governmental partners.
A new phenomenon has been developing lately owing to a growing link between peace and disarmament issues and human and sustainable development.
In this connection, the Centre is now more actively engaged in the planning and implementation of disarmament- and development-related assistance in the region, in tandem with the work of other United Nations agencies, development assistance donors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
During the period under review, the Centre carried out the activities described below.
Promoting subregional and regional security
The promotion of subregional and regional security primarily entails paying increased attention to defining, better understanding and supporting projects that affect the security and lives of people on a daily basis.
Requests for assistance by States in the region during the period under review have pertained to activities related to promoting disarmament and development initiatives, stimulating issues involving conventional weapons, supporting the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, as well as other related activities.
Enhancing development through disarmament
The Centre assisted Governments, international organizations and civil society in their quest for peace and human development through disarmament efforts by focusing on peacebuilding, post-conflict and reintegration measures.
The Centre also played an important role of facilitating coordination among these different entities and of carrying out capacity-building initiatives on the link between security and sustainable development.
Two separate capacity-building projects have been developed by the Centre to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to properly provide assistance to States upon request.
The first project has the dual goal of training United Nations staff members on the link between disarmament and development so that they may have the appropriate tool to effectively promote social and economic development, notably an increased ability to design, plan and carry out disarmament and development activities.
The second project aims at training United Nations officials to better understand the role of the organization in post-conflict reintegration processes.
The short-term goal of this training is to better equip the Centre and other agencies to plan and adopt standards for carrying out disarmament and development activities in the field.
The long-term goal is to create a context for improved cooperation and dialogue among United Nations agencies for the final implementation of this assistance.
The first training course in this series took place during 2004 for staff members of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Centre and the Department for Disarmament Affairs, exclusively.
Future disarmament and development courses will be available to all members of the CASA mechanism, and subsequently to NGO representatives working in that field.
It is then expected that major players will be able to better coordinate disarmament and development assistance.
The first capacity-building project evaluation will be conducted before the end of 2005 in order to gain lessons learned as well as basic information on current and planned assistance initiatives related to the Millennium Development Goals in the region and to assess the potential impact of the project.
Good governance and security sector reform
The Centre's assistance in the areas of good governance and security sector reform addresses such issues as public security, synergies between security and social policies, institutional problems related to the availability of resources or the lack thereof, the relationship between governmental entities, international organizations and civil society and other areas in which the Centre and its partners can play a meaningful role to improve security and enhance development opportunities.
For example, the Centre currently supports two projects in Costa Rica and Guatemala as part of a larger Central American firearms project, which count on the active involvement of national Governments, firearms commissions and local UNDP offices.
Specifically, the Centre is providing support to phase II of a Costa Rican project entitled “Programme for a comprehensive approach to violence with firearms as a public health problem”.
The project has four main objectives.
The first is to carry out research aimed at reducing the impact of firearms-related violence on human development.
The second is to improve firearms legislation and conduct capacity-building activities.
The third aims at decentralizing firearms-related policy implementation by developing measures at the municipal level.
The fourth is to develop an awareness-building campaign on firearms control.
In a similar vein, the activities taking place in Guatemala entail a preliminary series of studies on firearms proliferation and their impact on development, including the mapping of firearms demand and supply.
These initial actions lend fundamental support to the preparatory assistance being granted by UNDP-Guatemala to the Guatemalan Disarmament Commission in the development of a national firearms control policy.
Similar assistance related to good governance is being planned with the support of local UNDP offices in Argentina, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Paraguay and Uruguay.
Addressing the firearms problem
The Centre organized several activities to assist States in the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.
An ever-increasing number of activities were directed at fostering more partnerships among national, subregional and regional entities, as well as to facilitate the development by States of control legislation and procedures and the implementation of programmes described below.
Fostering the development and implementation of firearms-related instruments
The Centre has assisted States in maintaining continued dialogue on ways and means of implementing firearms-related instruments such as the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials, the Organization of American States (OAS), Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) model regulations, the Programme of Action, the United Nations Firearms Protocol, Andean Community decision 552 on the Andean Plan to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, several firearms resolutions of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), the Central American Integration System firearms project and Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and associated States firearms-related resolutions.
Various conferences, workshops and other events were also organized during the period under review with the aim of assisting States to implement their obligations, such as the design of firearms legislation, the development of capacity-building courses and reporting procedures.
Those activities included three transfer control initiatives workshops, held in the Bahamas (12 May 2005), Peru (19 and 20 May 2005) and Brazil (2 and 3 June 2005), and two meetings on assessing preparations for the 2005 biennial meeting of States on small arms and light weapons, held in Peru (9 and 10 September 2004) and the Bahamas (13 May 2005).
A clear example of these activities was the assistance provided by the Centre to States in the region to discuss the need for the development of common criteria in firearms imports and exports and firearms in transit.
This series of events generated various new requests for assistance ranging from the continuation of a forum for such discussion to technical assistance on the development of firearms legislation and capacity-building for the law enforcement and customs community.
The Centre is currently undertaking a review of these requests to prepare a response, in coordination with its partners and donors, to States in the region.
Another example is the assistance provided by the Centre to States in reporting on the Programme of Action.
The Centre, in cooperation with UNDP and several other partners, provided assistance to States in the region to assess the status of implementation of the Programme of Action, to discuss reporting methodologies, to identify new coordination and cooperation opportunities and to assess means and procedures of exploring the Centre's Small Arms and Light Weapons Administration System in reporting on activities related to the Programme of Action in the region.
In addition to organizing two workshops on reporting on the implementation of the Programme of Action, the Centre assisted Peru to prepare its report for the 2005 biennial meeting of States and has initiated discussions with the Bahamas, Paraguay and Uruguay to assist them in preparing reports for the 2006 United Nations conference to review progress made in the implementation of the Programme of Action.
Strengthening of firearms legislation
The Centre has provided, in cooperation with CICAD, technical assistance to members of parliament for the analysis of the status and drafting of national firearms legislation and related international instruments.
This assistance involved the use of a reference guide on norms and legal instruments on firearms, ammunition and explosives to provide information for the improvement of firearms legislation and to harmonize and/or standardize firearms legislation in the region.
Continued technical assistance is planned through the comparison of Latin American and Caribbean firearms legislation with that of States of the European Union, as well as through the identification of lessons learned and cooperation opportunities for 2005/06.
Developing training courses
The Centre has developed and organized, in cooperation with several partners, various training courses for law enforcement officials, members of parliament and their advisers, as well as NGO representatives in the region.
Courses have included both theoretical and practical sessions with simulation exercises, notably on the control of the legal firearms trade and the illicit trafficking in firearms, ammunition and explosives.
Three sets of courses were organized to train 329 individuals in the region during the period under review.
A total of 209 law enforcement officials were trained in basic firearms investigative techniques.
Work on the improvement of two training facilities was initiated at police academies in Costa Rica and Uruguay to facilitate future subregional courses.
It is expected that approximately 3,000 officials will be trained in 2005/06 during the next round of courses aimed at developing national ownership of the training courses.
Other training courses on intelligence and international cooperation are currently under development in coordination with the recently created Regional Public Security Training Centre in Brazil.
A web of five combined command posts at training facilities are being created in Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago and Uruguay to facilitate coordination on firearms-related courses among 33 countries in the region.
The Centre and its partners trained a total of 50 members of various parliaments and their advisers on firearms legislation for MERCOSUR and the members of associated States and the Andean Community.
The courses focused on, inter alia, how to draft firearms legislation, an assessment of the main actors involved in firearms control and the importance of incorporating the issues of gender, children and adolescents in the formulation of such legislation.
Two other courses are being prepared for Mexico and the Caribbean region.
It is expected that members of parliament and their advisers will continue this initial contact, forming a growing network established through the creation of the Centre's Parliamentary Exchange Initiative Project Database and the Permanent Parliamentary Forum.
The Centre and its partners also trained 42 members of different NGOs in the Andean Community and MERCOSUR and associated States, bringing the number of NGO representatives trained by the Centre so far to 70.
Those representatives are now expected to assist the Centre in the training of more NGO staff at the national level, thus enhancing Programme of Action-related research and advocacy in the region.
A total of 92 parliamentarians, their advisers and NGO representatives in the region were trained on the impact firearms-related violence has on women, adolescents and children, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).
As part of the gender mainstreaming action plan of the Department for Disarmament Affairs, the Centre also fostered the participation of women in all law enforcement training courses as a means of improving gender balance in that field.
The experience gained from those efforts will serve in developing a longer-term package to assist States in implementing resolution 1325 (2000).
2006 Lima challenge on weapons destruction and stockpile management
Assistance provided by the Centre to States in the destruction of small arms and light weapons during the period under review included the destruction or removal of 52,000 firearms in Brazil, Costa Rica and Paraguay, as well as the destruction of over 96 tons of ammunition and explosives in Paraguay.
The assistance also contained a capacity-building component to aid Government representatives in the further destruction of weapons, which resulted in the first such activity undertaken by Paraguayan army officers in early June 2005.
Work is currently under way for two other weapons destruction events in Peru and Uruguay for the second half 2005.
Other destruction assistance initiatives are currently being planned as part of a new project being developed with UNDP-Brazil.
Assistance in improving the security of weapons facilities was also among the activities developed during the period under review.
Some of the assistance provided to Brazil, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay entailed the development of firearms registration, including licensing, and storage management systems.
In this connection, the Centre is also currently developing an integrated weapons management system database for the improvement of weapons stockpile facilities in Costa Rica, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.
A slightly varied version of the database will also be available for weapons management and disarmament activities in peacekeeping operations.
Increasing database tools to enhance coordination and the exchange of information
The Centre's Small Arms and Light Weapons Administration System database was launched and currently operates as a centre for information exchange and assistance for the collection of information related to several firearms instruments.
Field-testing of the joint CICAD/United Nations Regional Centre Model Regulations Database provided sufficient information and lessons learned for a new database development phase, which will include the participation of several countries in the region as part of a growing request for assistance aimed at improving firearms and ammunition imports, exports and in-transit controls.
Enhancing participation of the firearms, ammunition and explosives industry
The Centre and CICAD/OAS have also promoted dialogue with the firearms industry and the commercial sector to assess potential contributions that the private sector can make to prevent firearms trafficking and to address requests made by States of the region in the area of public security.
Joint work includes the development of a regional forensics network to assist States in the exchange of information and in the development of capacity on firearms and ammunition information, which could enhance their capacity to trace firearms and detect the movement of weapons within and across borders.
CICAD/OAS and the Centre's FinDATA database will be used as the main information hub for this assistance, which will be launched at a regional workshop to be held in September 2005 in Brazil.
Fostering United Nations coordination
As the regional focal point of the Department for Disarmament Affairs for the United Nations CASA mechanism, the Centre is responsible for the organization of consultation meetings for coordination in the field.
In this regard, the Centre organized the first CASA consultation meeting in the field on 31 May 2005 in Brasilia, which led to increased coordination among United Nations agencies and a pledge for more coordination between the United Nations and the host country.
Follow-up consultation meetings are now planned for 2005 in Argentina, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).
During the reporting period, the Centre also designed and developed a database prototype for gathering information on CASA members covering their small arms and light weapons-related activities.
The CASA database, which includes a feature on country profiles, is scheduled to be launched during the 2005 biennial meeting of States on small arms and light weapons.
Increasing security through confidence-building measures
At the request of States for assistance in enhancing confidence- and security-building measures in the region, the Centre has developed and engaged in a wide variety of initiatives.
They include increasing the participation of civil society in disarmament and security matters, as well as providing an environment conducive to dialogue, information exchange and awareness-building in the field of conventional arms.
Developing a methodology for the comparison of military expenditures
The Centre and its partners recently completed the development of a standardized methodology on the comparison of military expenditures.
This methodological tool highlights the importance of confidence- and security-building measures and provides fertile soil for discussion of the missions, objectives and policies of national defence.
It forms part of a broader security-sector reform programme coordinated by the Department of Political Affairs and was carried out jointly by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Department for Disarmament Affairs and the Centre.
In addition, at the request of the Governments of Chile and Peru for assistance to undertake a study on the comparison of the military expenditures between the two countries, ECLAC and the Department, through the Centre, presented a project proposal that has been officially accepted.
Work is expected to start once an advisory committee in both Chile and Peru has been officially created.
Defence White Books
Assistance in the development of Defence White Books represents another measure undertaken by the Centre to address issues related to the strengthening of democratic values, practices and human security in the region.
The role of the Centre and its partners is to provide all concerned sectors of Government, parliaments and civil society with information on how to structure defence views, aims and policies, as well as the modus operandi for work on security-sector reform issues.
A two-year project to assist in the design of basic guidelines for the development of Defence White Books in the region was officially concluded during the period under review.
The project forms part of a broader security-sector reform programme coordinated by the Department of Political Affairs.
A request for support in the creation of a Defence White Book has already been received from the Government of Uruguay.
This will consist of assistance in the application of the basic guidelines, as well as the granting of access to a Defence White Book database developed by the Centre.
Regional security: cooperating for a safer region
The Centre plays an active role in enhancing cooperation for a safer region by responding to requests by States for the creation of an environment conducive to dialogue and information exchange and for support for efforts in the field of regional security.
In this connection, the Centre serves as a catalyst between States and national, subregional, regional and/or global organizations to develop policies aimed at assisting key strategic decision-making initiatives, as well as maximizing human, material and financial resources and avoiding duplication.
United Nations role in regional security
The Centre collects and inputs, on a yearly basis, information in a database regarding peace, disarmament and development-related events in the region.
Information on the status of treaty memberships and implementation, early warning and conflict resolution initiatives and the interrelationship between security and development constitutes a wealth of data for the assessment of trends, policies and the status of intra- and inter-country security.
Work has been initiated during the period under review to develop a prototype software for proof of concept that will allow for an assessment of this project and a final decision on full development before the end of 2005.
This information material, to be available online, is expected to assist interested actors in the decision-making process at the political, military, diplomatic and civil community levels and serve as a reference tool on security- and development-related issues.
Fostering Latin America and Caribbean partnership with the European Union
The Centre also assisted States by providing a platform for debates on the monitoring of follow-up to recommendations made by Heads of State and Government of Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe at their summits and prepared policy-oriented briefings addressing issues of interest for such summits.
Informal consultation meetings were undertaken with the European Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg during 2005 to begin the development of this project.
Other consultations are expected to continue during the second half of 2005, culminating with the creation of an expert group that will coordinate the work to be undertaken by different international and non-governmental institutions from both regions.
The results of such cooperation are expected to be useful for consideration by individual Governments in preparing for the next summit meeting between the two regions, to take place in Europe in 2006.
Forging an ever-greater partnership between the United Nations and the Organization of American States
CICAD and the United Nations have been engaged in cooperation on a regular basis and have continued to explore opportunities to assist States in the region in the implementation of international and regional firearms instruments.
It is deemed appropriate for the United Nations to expand this relationship with OAS to other areas beyond firearms, particularly after member States of OAS have redefined their concept and methodological strategy for addressing hemispheric security.
The Centre and OAS are therefore seeking to identify other areas of cooperation, such as drugs, terrorism and other common interests.
Initial contacts have taken place during the reporting period and a regional conference is planned to be organized at which member States of both organizations will have an opportunity to indicate their priority areas for cooperation.
Striving for global security
During the period under review, the Centre also assisted States in the region to develop activities in the area of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery vehicles.
Such assistance was aimed at fostering universality and highlighting social and economic development aspects of the relevant multilateral agreements.
It also addressed the issues of signature, ratification and implementation of those agreements.
Such activities covered four specific areas, as outlined below.
Supporting accession
During the reporting period, the Centre organized several consultation missions in cooperation with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Provisional Technical Secretariat of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization to provide States in the Caribbean (e.g., Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas and Dominica) with adequate information on the benefits and obligations related to accessions to the relevant multilateral agreements.
Presentations were made by the respective treaty organizations and the Centre on the development-related issues involved in accession to these disarmament instruments.
Concrete results from those consultations have been achieved.
as evidenced by progress in accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention, as in the case of the Bahamas, and the establishment of national disarmament commissions to address weapons-related issues in countries in the region.
A series of similar consultation missions are now planned for Barbados, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.
Assessing national legislation
The Centre also initiated work aimed at assisting States in the region to assess the status of their national legislation on weapons of mass destruction and their delivery vehicles, identify new coordination and cooperation opportunities and propose solutions to problems that might hamper their work undertaken either individually or jointly.
The results of this assessment will be available in a database to facilitate cross-references and track any legislative changes in the future.
This assistance includes the organization of three subregional workshops to address how States can best improve their national legislation to comply with related international disarmament instruments.
Workshops are expected to be organized as of late 2005 and concluded by mid-2006.
Developing regional networks
The Centre has developed a prototype chemical weapons regional assistance and protection network database, further to a request made by Latin American and Caribbean countries in November 2004.
The network was developed in cooperation with the Peruvian chemical weapons commission and will function under the direction of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
It is designed to serve as an Internet platform featuring information and data to facilitate coordination on and delivery of protection measures against chemical weapons to states Parties in the region, as specified in article X of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
It includes information on, inter alia, detection equipment and alarm systems, protection and decontamination equipment, advice and lessons learned, as well as other related protective measures.
The network is expected to be launched by the end of June 2005.
Addressing counter-terrorism
During the reporting period, the Centre explored the best ways and means of contributing to efforts already undertaken by States in the region in combating terrorism.
It was concluded that the Centre should link counter-terrorism initiatives undertaken by States to existing activities organized by the Centre in related areas, notably by enhancing coordination, cooperation and integration between law enforcement agencies, international organizations and other concerned entities.
A project currently under development will provide a forum for discussion on the concept of terrorism and policies in the region designed to counter terrorist activities.
The project also includes a training course entitled “combined counter-terrorism training” for law enforcement officials and other concerned entities responsible for combating terrorism.
The assistance provided by the Centre in addressing counter-terrorism will also include supporting joint training and research and development with respect to procedures and equipment (involving, e.g., trafficking of drugs and firearms, money-laundering, organized and semi-organized crime, etc.).
The first activity in this project is expected to be carried out during the second half of 2005.
C. Fostering peace and disarmament education
During the reporting period, the Centre provided assistance to Peruvian NGOs in the development of visual and printed material on peace and disarmament.
It also assisted Save the Children-Sweden in a project aimed at gradually widening the values of peace and disarmament around the celebration of the Peruvian national day (28 July).
This included the development of a poster for a national media contest on articles proposing new concepts for celebrating the national day.
It also included the preparation of a folder with images of folkloric dancers and other artistic activities during the celebrations of 28 July 2005 in Lima, as well as the preparation of a video and photos to promote a new way of celebrating the national day in 2006.
It is expected that those activities will help increase the cultural aspects of the celebrations and reduce the focus on the military-style parade during the events.
Staffing, financing and administration
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 41/60 J, the Centre was established on the basis of existing resources and voluntary contributions made by Member States and interested organizations for its core and programme functions.
During the reporting period, voluntary contributions in the amount of $196,837 were received.
The Secretary-General wishes to express his gratitude to the Governments of Colombia, Guyana, Mexico, Panama and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for their financial contributions to and support for the activities of the Centre and to the Government of Peru, the host country, for its overall support of the Centre.
Information on the status of the Trust Fund for the Centre for 2004 is contained in annex I to the present report.
Parallel funding in the amount of $218,200 was also made available for the Centre's activities from the voluntary Trust Fund for the United Nations Disarmament Information Programme, the Small Arms and Demobilization Unit of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships.
It should be noted that a contribution agreement has been signed with Sweden securing significant funding to the Centre for a duration of three years (2005-2007) in the amount of SKr 12 million.
Several governmental entities and other institutions have also contributed to the work of the Centre by sharing or absorbing the costs of joint events, personnel and/or material resources.
The Secretary-General wishes to express his gratitude for these contributions in support of the activities of the Centre.
The Centre is currently developing a new fund-raising strategy with a view to ensuring longer-term contribution agreements with donors to cover possibly five or more years of activities.
It is worth noting that, during the period under review, the Centre has developed more partnerships and common projects with an increased number of countries and subregional and regional organizations.
This expansion in partnerships will provide opportunities for joint fund-raising to secure longer-term financial support for the activities of the Centre.
The Centre has continued to adapt its programme of work to the realities and the needs of the region.
It has continued to maintain its human resources capacity by building into project proposals the staffing requirements for each project.
The Centre has also continued to pursue with the host Government the identification of a new and larger facility to accommodate more staff and equipment.
Several consultations have taken place in 2004 and 2005 and a facility with sufficient space to house the Centre has been identified.
Formal discussions between the United Nations and the host Government are expected to begin as from August 2005.
Pursuant to the consideration by the General Assembly of the Secretary-General's proposals for strengthening the security and safety of United Nations operations, staff and premises, funds have been allotted again from the regular budget to bring the security level of the Centre up to minimum operating security standards.
Observations and conclusions
The Centre has continued to provide assistance to States in the Latin American and Caribbean region in the implementation of regional initiatives in the areas of peace, disarmament and development.
During the period under review, such assistance was provided in the form of weapons destructions and stockpile management; training courses for the law enforcement community, members of parliament and their advisers and representatives of NGOs; guidance on reporting in connection with weapons-related instruments; and the development of methodologies for future confidence-building measures between States.
The Centre has also continued to develop activities that assist States to identify regional security needs and new areas of cooperation.
Concomitantly, the Centre has also intensified its coordination with other United Nations efforts towards peace and security in the region and therefore has been able to avoid duplication by synergizing its work with subregional, regional, global and non-governmental organizations.
The results of the Centre's activities during the reporting period have demonstrated its continued role as a viable regional actor in assisting States in the region to advance the cause of peace, disarmament and development in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The Centre has continued its public information strategy to ensure better dissemination of information on security issues as well as on the role of the United Nations in promoting peace, disarmament and development in the region among Government representatives, the military, NGOs and civil society.
It has furthermore continued to strengthen its core and programme functions, fund-raising strategy and human resources capacity so as to enhance its operational capacity to assist Member States in the region.
The Secretary-General counts on the continued and increasing support and cooperation of Member States and organizations to ensure the effective functioning of the Centre.

To foster discussions on public security in the region, to assist joint assessment of projects and programmes and to develop new coordination and cooperation initiatives among States and international and non-governmental organizations.
This series of workshops will also be directed at providing an opportunity for the Centre to contribute to different local public security initiatives, notably by fostering activities of the Regional Network of City Mayors and the Regional Public Security Training Centre aimed at coordinating various projects on citizen security related to firearms, peace and disarmament education, and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.
It is expected that this series of workshops will strengthen the growing number of initiatives to address the issue of crime in all its aspects, be it in cities or related to the illicit trafficking of firearms across States.
