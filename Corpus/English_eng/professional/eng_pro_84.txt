Appointment of the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services
Note by the Secretary-General
In its resolution 48/218 B of 29 July 1994, the General Assembly decided to establish an Office of Internal Oversight Services under the authority of the Secretary-General, the head of which would be at the rank of Under-Secretary-General, and also decided that the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services:
(a) Should be an expert in the fields of accounting, auditing, financial analysis and investigations, management, law or public administration;
(b) Should be appointed by the Secretary-General, following consultations with Member States, and approved by the General Assembly.
For that purpose, the Secretary-General should appoint the Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services with due regard for geographical rotation and in so doing should be guided by the provisions of paragraph 3 (e) of Assembly resolution 46/232 of 2Â March 1992 whereby the Assembly had decided, in particular, that, as a general rule, no national of a Member State should succeed a national of that State in a senior post and that there should be no monopoly on senior posts by nationals of any State or group of States;
(c) Should serve for one fixed term of five years without possibility of renewal;
(d) Might be removed by the Secretary-General only for cause and with the approval of the General Assembly.
In the light of the provisions of the resolution mentioned above, the Secretary-General proposes to appoint Inga-Britt Ahlenius (Sweden) as Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services for one fixed term of five years.
The effective date of her appointment will be communicated to the Assembly at a later stage.
The Secretary-General trusts that the General Assembly will approve this appointment.
