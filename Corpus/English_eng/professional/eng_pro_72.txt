SIXTH MEETING OF THE 10 17 June
ON THE PROHIBITION OF THE USE,
STOCKPILING, PRODUCTION AND
Sixth Meeting
Zagreb, 28 November - 2 December
Item 4 11 of the revised provisional agenda
Consideration of the general status and
operation of the Convention
Proposed by the President
We, the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction have gathered in Zagreb, Croatia, to reaffirm the commitments made one year ago at the historic Nairobi Summit on a Mine Free World.
We remain as determined as ever to secure our achievements to date, to sustain and strengthen cooperation under the Convention, and to spare no effort to meet our challenges in universalizing the Convention, destroying stockpiled mines, clearing mined areas and assisting the victims.
Our sense of responsibility has also been illustrated to the world by the fact that we are meeting for the first time in South Eastern Europe - a region heavily affected by anti-personnel mines.
Despite recent conflicts, all countries of the region have joined the Convention, cooperating in applying its provisions and determined to free this region from the scourge of anti-personnel mines in the nearest future.
We maintain that through the vigorous pursuit of the provisions of the Convention and the aims of the Nairobi Action Plan, we indeed will achieve major progress towards ending, for all people and for all time, the suffering caused by anti-personnel mines.
In Zagreb, we have noted with great satisfaction the progress made over the past year in applying the Nairobi Action Plan:
(1) Since the Nairobi Summit, States have ratified or acceded to the Convention, bringing to the number of States that have accepted the Convention's comprehensive approach to ending the suffering caused by anti-personnel mines.
(2) A total of 134 States Parties now no longer hold stockpiled anti-personnel mines, together having destroyed almost 38 million mines.
(3) Suriname has reported fulfillment of its obligation to clear all anti-personnel mines from mined areas under its jurisdiction or control, joining Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Djibouti and Honduras in achieving this important milestone.
(4) Many of the 24 States Parties that have reported the responsibility for significant numbers of landmine survivors have developed concrete objectives to guide our assistance efforts between now and the Convention's Second Review Conference in 2009.
Equally though, we have noted that great challenges persist:
(5) [Forty-seven (47)] States have yet to ratify or accede to the Convention, including some that continue to use, produce, or possess large stockpiles of anti-personnel mines, or otherwise warrant special concern.
In addition, several armed non-State actors continue to use anti-personnel mines.
(6) Thirteen (13) States Parties still need to fulfill their obligations to destroy stockpiled anti-personnel mines.
(7) Forty-six (46) States Parties still need to fulfill their obligations to clear all anti-personnel mines from mined areas under their jurisdiction or control, including 22 which are obliged to do so in 2009, prior to our Second Review Conference.
(8) The 24 States Parties with the responsibility for significant numbers of mine victims need to continue to do their utmost to respond in a concrete, measurable and meaningful way, and those in a position to assist them should respond to the priorities for assistance as articulated by those States Parties in need.
The 70 recommendations of the Nairobi Action Plan remain the guiding principles to overcome these challenges.
In addition, to focus our efforts in the coming year, we welcome the Zagreb Progress Report and its identification of priorities for 2006.
We recognize the urgency required in fulfilling our obligations under the Convention and our responsibilities to mine-affected communities, to landmine survivors and to future generations to whom we have promised a world free of anti-personnel mines.
