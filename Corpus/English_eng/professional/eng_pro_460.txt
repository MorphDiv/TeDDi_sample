Strengthening United Nations action in the field of human rights through the promotion of international cooperation and the importance of non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity
Report of the Secretary-General
Introduction
In its resolutions 56/153 of 19 December 2001, 57/203 of 18 December 2002, 58/168 of 22 December 2003 and 59/190 of 20 December 2004, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report on the strengthening of United Nations action in the field of human rights through the promotion of international cooperation based on the principles of non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity, taking into account the views of Member States.
Furthermore, the Assembly decided to continue consideration of the question at its sixtieth session under the item entitled “Human rights questions”.
In compliance with paragraph 11 of those resolutions, the Secretary-General, in a note verbale dated 25 February 2005, invited Member States to present practical proposals and ideas that would contribute to the strengthening of United Nations action in the field of human rights through the promotion of international cooperation based on the principles of non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity.
As of 5 July 2005, a reply had been received from the Government of Georgia, which is reproduced below.
Additional replies received, if any, will be issued as addenda to the present report.

The protection and encouragement of human rights and freedom have always been priority objectives of the country's political leaders.
Despite difficulties during the past few years, the principle of the primacy of human rights, which was of great importance for the country's democratic development, has always been respected by the Georgian authorities.
Following the adoption of the Georgian Constitution, new legislation has been developed, which is essentially derived from the norms and principles of international law.
Georgian law, which is in conformity with the country's Constitution and the international treaties to which it is party, plays a decisive role in the effective protection of human rights.
It should be noted that, in accordance with the national Constitution, international treaties to which Georgia is party, if not contrary to the Constitution, have a higher legal rank than domestic laws.
Georgia continues its fruitful cooperation with international organizations in the field of human rights.
The Government pays particular attention to the commitments entered into under the two United Nations covenants and four conventions on human rights, punctually submits reports to the competent bodies concerning their implementation, participates in the relevant deliberations and respects the recommendations of the appropriate committees.
Georgia actively collaborates with United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights.
This was exemplified by the visit to Georgia of Mr. Manfred Nowak, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, who was invited by the Government in February 2005.
Georgia's competent institutions maintain permanent contacts with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
As regards concrete proposals for strengthening United Nations action in the field of human rights, we think that, at present, the full potential of the United Nations is not being used.
In this context, we endorse the new initiative of the Secretary-General concerning the establishment of a Human Rights Council to replace the Commission on Human Rights.
Clearly, if this reform is successful, the effectiveness of all the human rights protection mechanisms would have to be strengthened.
Furthermore, we think that the reform of the United Nations reporting system needs to be accelerated; this would significantly facilitate access to and objective evaluation of information on the current human rights situation in the various Member States.
