Contents
Introduction
The General Assembly, in its biennial resolution 58/28, inter alia, called upon all Member States to report annually, by 30 April, to the Secretary-General their military expenditures for the latest fiscal year for which data were available, using, preferably and to the extent possible, the reporting instrument as recommended in its resolution 35/142 B or, as appropriate, any other format developed in conjunction with similar reporting on military expenditures to other international or regional organizations, and encouraged Member States that had no information to submit nil returns.
By operative paragraphs 5 (b), (f) and (g) of its resolution 58/28, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General, within available resources, to circulate annually the reports on military expenditures as received from Member States; to promote international and regional symposia and training seminars to explain the purpose of the United Nations system for the standardized reporting of military expenditures and to give relevant technical instructions; and to report on experiences gained during such symposia and training seminars.
On 15 February 2005, a note verbale was sent to Member States requesting them to submit their reports no later than 30 April 2005.
The replies received are reproduced in section III below.
Any additional replies received from Member States will be issued as addenda to the present report.
Action taken
Pursuant to operative paragraph 5 (f) of General Assembly resolution 58/28 and within existing resources, the Secretariat engaged in activities to enhance familiarity with and encourage greater participation in the United Nations standardized instrument for reporting military expenditures.
The nature, scope and the progress of the United Nations standardized instrument for reporting military expenditures were discussed with the delegations of Member States at the following events: (a) a regional workshop covering the Member States belonging to the Pacific Islands Forum, held in Nadi, Fiji, from 18 to 20 August 2004, which was organized by the Department for Disarmament Affairs; (b) a presentation by the Department in the plenary session of the Committee on Hemispheric Security of the Organization of American States, held in Washington, D.C., on 25 April 2005; and (c) a regional workshop focusing on the Horn of Africa, and Great Lakes regions and Southern Africa, held in Nairobi, Kenya, from 31 May to 2 June 2005, which was organized by the Department with financial contributions from the Governments of the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Execution of the budget for 2004 was 321.528.158 BAM; Structure of the budget in 2004 was:
The personnel expenses: 261.008.867 BAM or 81,18% of the total budget, The operation and maintenance expenses: 56.310.891 BAM or 17,52% of the total budget, The capital expenses: 4.208.400 or 1,3% of the total budget
Significantly high percentage of the personnel expenses in the total budget is caused by severance pay to the discharged personnel through process of the BH Armed Forces reduction; The capital expenses were approved in a symbolic amount, which covered only minimal procurement of the equipment and partially basic reconstruction works and investment maintenance and procurement of the construction material; It was the same in previous years.
Due to the lack of funds in budget, there were not approved funds for the R&D activities; In 2004, the Ministry of Defense of B&H and Armed Forces of B&H did not receive any kind of financial donations from domestic or foreign sponsors.
Course: 1 EUR = 1.95583 BAM
Planned defense budget for 2005 is 274.016.648 BAM; Structure of the budget in 2005 is planned:
The personnel expenses: 212.043.540 BAM or 77,38% of the total budget, The operation and maintenance expenses: 54.407.668 BAM or 19,85% of the total budget, The capital expenses: 4.208.400 or 2,76%
In the defense budget for 2005 the percentage of personnel expenses shall be lower than in 2004, but it is still high comparing to international standards;
We want to emphasize that budget for 2005 shall be 15% lower than budget in 2004, so this is one of reasons that personnel expenses are still very high in the total amount;
The approved capital expenses for 2005 are still in very symbolic amount, which can cover only minimum of prior procurement of the equipment and partially basic reconstruction works; The same as in previous years, due to the lack of funds in budget there were not approved funds for the R&D activities; In 2005, the Ministry of Defense of B&H and Armed Forces of B&H do not count with any financial donations from domestic or foreign sponsors.
Course: 1 EUR = 1.95583 BAM
