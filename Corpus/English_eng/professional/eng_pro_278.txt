Chisinau Declaration of the GUUAM Heads of State
“In the name of democracy, stability and development”
The Heads of State of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine,
Guided by the goals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the constituent documents of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and of GUUAM, particularly the Yalta Charter,
Confirming the commitment of the GUUAM States to European standards and values and their desire to continue along the course of European integration,
Noting the growing role in common European processes of regional cooperation based on mutual respect for the sovereign rights of States and stressing that such cooperation contributes to the development of democracy, aiming to strengthen security and stability, economic development, and cultural and social growth,
Determined to assert democratic values in all areas of Government activity and in the life of society, to ensure strict respect for human rights, to strengthen a spirit of trust and tolerance and to accord unconditional priority to the rule of law both in domestic and in international affairs,
Expressing deep concern at continuing crises and increasing risks to security, particularly threats from international terrorism, aggressive separatism, extremism and related dangerous phenomena,
Emphasizing that unresolved conflicts in a number of GUUAM States are undermining their sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence, complicating the full implementation of democratic reforms and the economic development of the region, adversely affecting European integration processes and presenting a challenge to the international community,
Welcoming the enlargement of the European Union, and noting their mutual readiness to build closer relations and develop cooperation on the basis of European norms and standards,
Noting the openness of GUUAM to other countries and organizations sharing the same aims and principles,
Declare their commitment to the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms and their constant desire to consolidate democratic stability and develop economic cooperation among the GUUAM States in the interest of their peoples;
Confirm the need to further strengthen and expand cooperation among States to combat international terrorism and extremism and such associated negative phenomena as illicit drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, human trafficking, illegal migration, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, illegal arms trading, money-laundering and corruption, in implementation of the Declaration on common efforts to ensure stability and security in the region and the Agreement on cooperation among the Governments of the GUUAM participating States to combat terrorism, organized crime and other dangerous types of crime;
Express their firm determination to contribute jointly to maintaining peace and stability and declare their intention to promote military and political cooperation, including cooperation in the context of peacekeeping operations;
Note the futility and destructiveness of separatism and disintegration and the incompatibility of the use of force, ethnic cleansing and seizure of territory with European experience and values, which include, in particular, ethnic diversity and cultural variety; and stress the importance of intensifying concerted efforts by the GUUAM States and the international community to resolve the Transdniestria issue and the conflicts in Azerbaijan and Georgia on the basis of the norms and principles of international law by reintegrating lawless territories into the States of which they are a part and by ensuring that the various ethnic groups coexist peacefully within the internationally recognized borders of States;
Stress the importance of the decisions of the OSCE Summit held in Istanbul in 1999, and call on all OSCE States to do their utmost to ensure that the Russian Federation fulfils its commitment to withdraw its troops and weapons fully from the Republic of Moldova and Georgia;
Support the peace initiatives and processes aimed at resolving existing conflicts and, in that context, welcome recent proposals, the peace plan presented by the President of Georgia for South Ossetian autonomy, the ongoing “Prague Process” negotiations within the OSCE Minsk Group, as well as the proposals made at the GUUAM Summit by the President of Ukraine and the President of Romania to resolve the Transdniestria issue;
Confirm the policy of deepening the European integration of the GUUAM States and establishing partnership relations with the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization in order to create a common security space and promote cooperation in economic and transport matters, and declare their intention to cooperate closely in those areas; and confirm their intention to continue mutually beneficial cooperation with the United States of America and to develop the closest possible relations with organizations and States which share the aims and principles of GUUAM;
Call for rapid implementation of the Agreement on the establishment of a free-trade area and the exploitation of the potential for transit, in order to ensure, inter alia, reliable supplies of energy and the efficient and safe operation of transport corridors, which will facilitate the strengthening of European integration and protection of international security, the development of East-West trade and economic relations and the improvement of the transport and communications infrastructure in the strategically important GUUAM region;
Stress the need for energy-related cooperation within GUUAM, especially through the intensification of efforts to implement joint programmes and projects, on the basis of commercial viability, to transport energy resources of the Caspian region to the European energy market through the territories of the participating States;
Call for a strengthening of cooperation in the humanitarian sphere, particularly in the fields of tourism, health care, education, culture and sport;
Declare their intention to establish a regional organization on the basis of GUUAM to pursue the goals of democracy and development, in order to attain the objectives of the GUUAM Yalta Charter and of this Declaration, taking into account the importance of economic and social development and of the creation of an area of democratic stability and security in the GUUAM region, and also to give new impetus to cooperation.
The Presidents have instructed the GUUAM Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs to discuss the issues further and submit agreed proposals.
