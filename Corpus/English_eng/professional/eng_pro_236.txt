Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Mandate and planned results
The mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1542 (2004) of 30 April 2004.
The most recent extension of the mandate was authorized by the Council in its resolution 1576 (2004) of 29 November 2004.
The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to restore peace and security and to further the constitutional political process under way in Haiti.
Within this overall objective, the Mission will, during the budget period, contribute to a number of expected accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below.
These frameworks are grouped by components, secure and stable environment, political process, human rights, humanitarian and development coordination and support.
The expected accomplishments would lead to the fulfilment of the Security Council's objective within the lifetime of the Mission and the indicators of achievement show a measurement of progress towards such accomplishments during the budget period.
The human resources of the Mission in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the Mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Mission as a whole.
Variances in the number of personnel, compared with the budget of 2004/05, including reclassifications, have been explained under the respective components.
The Mission is established in 10 districts, comprising the Mission headquarters in Port-au-Prince, three regional headquarters (Cap-Haitien, Gonaïves and Les Cayes) and six district offices (Jacmel, Port-de-Paix, Hinche, Miragoâne, Fort-Liberté and Jérémie).
The military, formed police and civilian police components of the Mission are deployed in 23 areas of responsibility, centred in Port-au-Prince (divided into four areas), Cap-Haitien, Fort Liberté, Port-de-Paix, Gonaïves, Saint Marc, Hinche, Jacmel, Les Cayes, Jérémie, Killick, Brach, Léogân, Cabaret, Petit-Goâves, Pignon, Tierre Rouge, Ouanaminthe, Mirebalais and Port-Salut.

In addition, the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative as well as the Office of the Deputy Special Representative (Humanitarian and development coordination) are presented as part of the executive direction and management, as their functions and responsibilities encompass several components of the Mission.

The estimated value of non-budgeted contributions for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 is as follows:
(Thousands of United States dollars)
a Estimated rental value of Government-provided lands and premises.
Analysis of variances
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The increased requirements result from the full deployment over the budget period of the authorized military strength of 6,700 contingent personnel, adjusted by a 2 per cent vacancy factor, compared with a phased deployment of a maximum strength of 5,844 troops, adjusted by a 10 per cent delayed deployment factor in the 2004/05 budget.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The increased requirements result from the application of a 5 per cent vacancy factor, compared with a 40 per cent delayed deployment factor in the 2004/05 budget.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The increased requirements result from the full deployment over the budget period of 875 police officers in formed units, adjusted by a 2 per cent vacancy factor, compared with a phased deployment of 750 police officers, adjusted by a 30 per cent delayed deployment factor in the 2004/05 budget.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The additional requirements are mainly attributable to a 10 per cent vacancy factor applied to the full deployment of the international staff, compared with a 35 per cent delayed recruitment factor applied to a phased deployment in the budget for 2004/05.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The increased requirements are attributable mainly to a 5 per cent vacancy factor applied to the full deployment of the national staff, compared with a 45 per cent delayed recruitment factor applied to a phased deployment in the budget for 2004/05.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The additional requirements are attributable mainly to a 5 per cent vacancy factor applied to the full deployment of the Volunteers, compared with a 30 per cent delayed recruitment factor applied to a phased deployment in the budget for 2004/05.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The lower requirements result from the fact that the Mission is planning to enter into a service contract for its interpretation and translation needs, while the budget for 2004/05 provided for the hiring of local language assistants.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The increased requirements result principally from the need to hire international consultants to conduct assessments and expert analysis in gender mainstreaming policy, HIV/AIDS programmes and in small arms, urban violence and conflict resolution.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The higher requirements result mainly from the full deployment of civilian personnel, leading to additional within-mission travel and training-related travel, and from additional international travel of Mission staff for consultations in relation to the electoral process, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process as well as the rule of law, human rights and humanitarian development areas.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The higher requirements result mainly from increased construction services, principally to expand the rehabilitation and upgrading of essential roads and seaport jetties and to develop 37 new helicopter landing sites and reconstruct 4 airfields for the operation of a fixed-wing aircraft, as well as a higher provision for the self-sustainment of military contingents and formed police units owing to their full deployment and lower anticipated vacancy rates, the need to install fuel vehicle dispensing points in 13 districts to improve the storage and supply of fuel and higher rental charges as Government-provided premises do not meet the Mission's needs.
• Management: reduced inputs and additional outputs
The reduced requirements are attributable mainly to the fact that only 20 additional heavy duty police four-wheel drive vehicles needed for patrols of the civilian police, 13 additional light and medium buses required to operate a daily shuttle service for civilian and police personnel, as well as the replacement of 5 buses to be written-off and 8 additional motorcycles have been included in this budget, whereas the budget for 2004/05 provided for the establishment of the Mission's vehicle fleet.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The additional requirements are mainly attributable to a higher actual rental cost of the three Puma military helicopters than estimated in the budget for 2004/05.
The Mission will also replace the Bell 212 civilian helicopter with a fixed-wing aircraft (Casa 235 or Dash 7) for logistical flights and aero-medical evacuations.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The lower requirements result from the fact that the Mission will enter into a turn key contract for its coastal freight operations, instead of procuring marine vessels as included in the budget for 2004/05.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The increased requirements are mainly attributable to higher public information services for the production of 5,016 minutes per month of radio programmes, 1,260 minutes per month of video programmes, as well as flyers, billboards, banners, posters, T-shirts, theatrical performances and workshops in support of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, the electoral process, the national dialogue, good governance, law and order, human rights and humanitarian and development efforts.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The lower requirements result from reduced acquisition of information technology equipment, which comprise only the replacement of items to be written-off and some additional equipment for the geographic information system, while the budget for 2004/05 provided for the establishment of the Mission's information technology network.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The higher requirements result from the full deployment of the military, police and civilian personnel over the budget period, compared with a phased deployment in the 2004/05 budget, and to lower anticipated vacancy rates.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The increased requirements are attributable to a higher provision for the self-sustainment of military contingents and formed police units, owing to their full deployment over the budget period, compared with a phased deployment in the 2004/05 budget, and to lower anticipated vacancy rates.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The higher requirements relate principally to the reintegration activities of the Mission, which will necessitate registration costs, feeding costs, cash reinsertion benefits, counselling, community mobilization and sensitization programmes, employment projects and programmes and educational reintegration programmes, as well as disaster protection and environmental protection training.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The increased requirements result from the need to implement an estimated 100 quick impact projects, compared with only 20 in the budget for 2004/05, aimed at improving local medical, educational and sanitation infrastructure as well as supporting grass-root initiatives that would be undertaken in support of the political process.
Expenditure for the period from 1 May to 30 June 2004
The General Assembly, in its resolution 59/17, appropriated the amount of $49,259,800 for the period from 1 May to 30 June 2004 previously authorized by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions for the establishment of the Mission under the terms of section IV of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994.
The total amount was assessed on Member States.
The expenditure for the period from 1 May to 30 June 2004 amounted to $34,556,100.
Financial resources
Expenditure for the period from 1 May to 30 June 2004 (Thousands of United States dollars)
Analysis of variances
The lower requirements resulted mainly from the delayed deployment of troops and their contingent-owned equipment, owing to delays in the transfer of authority from the Multinational Interim Force to the Mission.
The lower requirements resulted mainly from overestimation of the cost for the deployment travel of civilian police officers.
No expenditure were incurred since no formed police units were deployed as of 30 June 2004, as arrangements with police-contributing countries could not be finalized during the period.
The reduced requirements resulted principally from delays in the recruitment of staff, as staff from existing peacekeeping operations were not available for deployment to the Mission as expected.
The reduced requirements resulted mainly from delays in the recruitment of staff during the short period of time.
No expenditure were incurred since no Volunteers were deployed as of 30 June 2004, as arrangements to deploy them could not be finalized during the period.
The higher requirements were mainly attributable to travel of Mission staff to Brindisi, Italy, for security and public information training, as well as travel of Headquarters staff to the Mission for pre-deployment training, which had not been included in the commitment authority.
The reduced requirements were mainly attributable to delays in the procurement of prefabricated facilities, generators, security and safety equipment, bridges and field defence supplies, since many items were not available in the strategic deployment stock and system contracts could not be finalized during the period.
The lower requirements resulted mainly from the fact that only 161 vehicles were procured as of 30 June 2004 compared to 277 provided for in the commitment authority.
The reduced requirements were mainly a result of lower expenditure for commercial communications, as the Mission's communications system could not be completed during the period and the deployment of the military, civilian and police personnel was delayed.
The lower requirements were mainly attributable to the delayed deployment of the military, civilian and police personnel, leading to reduced needs for medical services and supplies.
The reduced requirements were attributable to the fact that no observation equipment could be procured during the short period of time.
The lower requirements were mainly attributable to lower freight expenditure for the shipment of equipment from United Nations Logistics Base to the Mission, since fewer items than expected were available in the strategic deployment stock.
No quick impact project was implemented during the period owing to the delayed recruitment of civilian personnel.
Actions to be taken by the General Assembly
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the Mission are:
(a) To decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $14,703,700 with respect to the period from 1 May to 30 June 2004;
