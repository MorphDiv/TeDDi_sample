In the absence of the President, Mr. Dauth (Australia), Vice-President, took the Chair.
The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.
Agenda item 113 (continued)
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations (A/59/668/Add.13)
The Acting President: The presidency congratulates those delegations whose representatives have bothered to turn up, in particular those who bothered to turn up anywhere near on time.
It continues to be a source of great disquiet to me that Member States are so badly behaved when it comes to basic work habits.
I would like to invite the attention of the General Assembly to document A/59/668/Add.13, in which the Secretary-General informs the President of the General Assembly that, since the issuance of his communications contained in documents A/59/668 and addenda 1 to 12, Malawi has made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.
May I take it that the General Assembly duly takes note of the information contained in this document?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 8 (continued)
Organization of work, adoption of the agenda and allocation of items: request for the reopening of the consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 17
The Acting President: In order for the Assembly to consider the report of the Fifth Committee under agenda item 17 (b) (A/59/583/Add.1), it will be necessary to reopen consideration of the sub-item.
May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to reopen consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 17?
It was so decided.
Agenda item 17 (continued)
Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments
(b) Appointment of members of the Committee on Contributions
Report of the Fifth Committee (A/59/583/Add.1)
The Acting President: If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the report of the Fifth Committee that is before the Assembly today.
It was so decided.
The Acting President: Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote or position.
The positions of delegations regarding the recommendation of the Fifth Committee have been made in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records.
May I remind members that under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401 the Assembly agreed that
“When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee.”
May I also remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote or position are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.
Before we begin to take action on the recommendation contained in the report of the Fifth Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take a decision in the same manner as was done in the Fifth Committee.
The Fifth Committee recommends, in paragraph 4 of its report, that the General Assembly appoint Mr. Henrique da Silveira Sardinha Pinto of Brazil as a member of the Committee on Contributions for a term of office beginning on 6 June 2005 and ending on 31 December 2005.
May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to appoint Mr. Henrique da Silveira Sardinha Pinto of Brazil as a member of the Committee on Contributions for a term of office beginning on 6 June 2005 and ending on 31 December 2005?
It was so decided.
The Acting President: May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 17?
It was so decided.
The meeting rose at 10.15 a.m.
