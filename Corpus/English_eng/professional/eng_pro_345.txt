Programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005
Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly
Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/59/L.69/Rev.1
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly on the programme budget implications of draft resolution A/59/L.69/Rev.1 (A/C.5/59/35/Rev.1).
An analysis of the requirements of the draft resolution is contained in paragraphs 3 to 10 of the statement by the Secretary-General.
In paragraph 3 (b) of the draft resolution, it is proposed to add two further additional posts at management and senior levels to the Office of the President of the General Assembly “from within existing resources, subject to consideration by the Assembly of the Secretary-General's proposed budget for 2006-2007”.
As noted in the statement by the Secretary-General (A/C.5/59/35, para.
3), this would require the provision of one D-2 and one P-5 position, representing additional resources over and above those requested in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007.
The Secretary-General notes that, while the draft resolution makes reference to posts, it also calls for them to be filled on an annual basis.
He concludes that the appropriate budgetary mechanism, under the circumstances, would be to make provision under general temporary assistance.
The costs associated with the provision of general temporary assistance for the further additional D-2 and P-5 positions are estimated at $116,300 for the remaining part of the biennium 2004-2005 and $823,300 for the biennium 2006-2007.
The Advisory Committee points out that “management and senior” level posts do not necessarily equate to D-2 and P-5; the statement of programme budget implications does not provide a justification for the provision of the positions at these levels.
Information should be provided to the Fifth Committee in time for its consideration of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 (see para.
7 below).
Paragraph 3 (b) of the draft resolution calls for the provision of these additional posts to be met from “within existing resources”.
However, according to the Secretary-General, no existing capacity can be identified at present to accommodate these requirements (A/C.5/59/35/Rev.1, para.
In this connection, the Secretary-General recalls that the Advisory Committee, in its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, emphasized the responsibility of the Secretariat to inform the General Assembly thoroughly and accurately about whether there are enough resources to implement a new activity (A/54/7, para.
In its first report on the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007 (A/60/7), the Advisory Committee comments extensively on the need for the Secretary-General to manage the Secretariat as a whole and for flexibility in the deployment and redeployment of resources.
The General Assembly may wish to take those comments and recommendations into account when considering this matter.
With regard to the request contained in paragraph 3 (d) of the draft resolution regarding the provision of proper protocol services to the President of the General Assembly at Headquarters and at other United Nations duty stations, the Secretary-General notes that protocol services are provided to the President on an occasional basis when the Assembly meets.
However, according to the Secretary-General, it is not currently feasible to provide a dedicated full-time protocol officer to the President owing to insufficient capacity in the Protocol and Liaison Service; accordingly, a new P-3 post would be necessary.
The total requirements arising from the request in paragraph 3 (d) are estimated at $138,100 for 2006-2007.
The Advisory Committee was not convinced that the provision of “proper protocol services” requires the creation of a dedicated and additional established post at this time.
By paragraph 14 of the draft resolution, the Secretary-General is requested to issue the rules of procedure of the General Assembly in a consolidated version in all official languages, in print and online.
As noted in paragraph 9 of the statement by the Secretary-General, the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management would require general temporary assistance resources equivalent to three work-months of one Professional staff member and two work-months of one General Service staff member, at a total estimated cost of $60,300 for 2006-2007.
The Advisory Committee, noting the level of resources proposed to be made available to the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management for 2006-2007, is of the opinion that every effort should be made to absorb these costs.
The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution A/59/L.69/Rev.1, additional resources of up to $116,300 would be required under section 1, Overall policy-making, direction and coordination, of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005.
As noted in paragraph 11 of the statement by the Secretary-General, efforts would be made to accommodate these requirements within the appropriation for the biennium; the actual costs, if any, would be reported in the second performance report.
The adoption of the draft resolution would also give rise to additional resource requirements of up to $961,400 under section 1, Overall policy-making, direction and coordination ($823,300 for the Office of the President of the General Assembly and $138,100 for the Protocol and Liaison Service) and up to $60,300 under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007.
The Advisory Committee recalls General Assembly resolution 58/270, which reaffirms that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters.
The reference in paragraph 3 (b) of the draft resolution to making the provision of additional resources subject to consideration of the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007 by the General Assembly is, in the opinion of the Committee, in the spirit of and consistent with Assembly resolution 58/270.
Under the circumstances, the Committee points out that the actual quantum of resources to be provided to support the President of the General Assembly during 2006-2007 will be determined by the Assembly on the basis of such recommendation(s) as the Fifth Committee may make on the proposed programme budget for 2006-2007.
The Advisory Committee also points out that whatever is eventually decided regarding support for the Office of the President of the General Assembly should be subject to review after an appropriate period of time.
