Sixth Meeting
Zagreb, 28 November - 2 December 2005
Item 6 of the provisional agenda
Adoption of the budget
ESTIMATED COSTS FOR CONVENING THE SIXTH MEETING OF THE STATES PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION ON THE PROHIBITION OF THE USE, STOCKPILING, PRODUCTION AND TRANSFER OF ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES AND ON THEIR DESTRUCTION
Note by the Secretariat
The General Assembly, in paragraph 8 of its resolution 59/84 of 3 December 2004, requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to undertake the preparations necessary to convene the next meeting of the States Parties, pending a decision to be taken at the First Review Conference.
The First Review Conference held at Nairobi from 29 November to 3 December 2004, decided, as stipulated in paragraph 33 (a) of the Final Report of the Conference (APLC/CONF/2004/5), that the Sixth Meeting of the States Parties shall be convened in Croatia, from 28 November to 2 December 2005.
This document is submitted pursuant to the above-mentioned request and provides estimated costs in the amount of US$456,000 for conference and non-conference servicing of the Conference.
A breakdown of these costs is provided in the attached table.
It should be noted that the costs are estimated on the basis of past experience and anticipated workload.
The actual costs will be determined after the closing of the Conference when the exact workload is known.
At that time, any adjustments in contributions by the participants sharing the costs will be made accordingly.
With regard to the financial arrangements, it will be recalled that, in accordance with article 14 (1) of the Convention, “the costsshall be borne by the States Parties and States not parties to this Convention participating therein, in accordance with the United Nations scale of assessment adjusted appropriately”.
Since preparations for the Sixth Meeting of the States Parties will involve costs that will need to be defrayed beforehand, and as the holding the meeting shall have no financial implications for the regular budget of the United Nations, the Secretariat will prepare and issue assessment notices as soon as the States Parties have accepted the attached estimated costs in accordance with the established practice.
The States Parties should proceed with the payment of their assessed share of the estimated costs as soon as the assessments notices have been received.
Finally, it should be noted that the Government of Croatia will make available at its cost such conference space and facilities as are necessary for the holding of the Sixth Meeting on the basis of a separate agreement with the United Nations.
