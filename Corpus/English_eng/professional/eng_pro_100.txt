Fifty-ninth session
Request for the inclusion of an additional sub-item in the agenda of the fifty-ninth session
Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments: confirmation of the appointment of the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme
Note by the Secretary-General
In paragraph 22 of its resolution 1240 (XIII) of 14 October 1958 on the establishment of the Special Fund, the General Assembly provided that the Secretary-General, after having consulted the Governing Council of the Special Fund, would appoint the Managing Director, subject to confirmation by the Assembly.
This procedure has been construed as applying also to the appointment of the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme.
By its decision 53/323 of 23 April 1999, the General Assembly confirmed the appointment by the Secretary-General of Mark Malloch Brown as Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme for a four-year term of office beginning on 1 July 1999.
By its decision 57/415 of 15 April 2003, the General Assembly confirmed the appointment by the Secretary-General of Mark Malloch Brown for a further four-year period beginning on 1 July 2003.
The search for a new Administrator was necessitated by the Secretary-General's decision to appoint Mr. Malloch Brown as his Chief of Staff effective 18 January 2005.
Following consultations with members of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme, the Secretary-General now requests the General Assembly to confirm the appointment of Kemal Derviş of Turkey as Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme for a four-year term of office commencing on 15 August 2005 and ending on 14 August 2009.
In the light of the foregoing, the Secretary-General has the honour to request, pursuant to rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the inclusion in the agenda of the fifty-ninth session of an additional sub-item entitled “Confirmation of the appointment of the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme”, under agenda item 17, entitled “Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments”.
