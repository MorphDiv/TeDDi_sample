Acknowledging also that security and development are intertwined and mutually reinforcing and that development is an indispensable foundation of collective security,
Aiming at the expansion of the membership of the Security Council to better reflect contemporary world realities, thereby shaping a balance of forces capable of enhancing the Council's responsiveness to the views and needs of all Member States, in particular developing countries, and ensuring the adoption of improved working methods,
Recognizing the ongoing efforts of the Security Council to improve its working methods,
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council, which began its work in January 1994,
Seeking in particular to enhance the transparency of the Security Council and the participation of non-members of the Council in its work,
