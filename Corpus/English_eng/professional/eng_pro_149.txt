Paragraph 5
The paragraph should read:
In order to carry out its mandate, the Force maintains the area of separation agreed at Geneva in May 1974.
The area of separation is approximately 80 km in length from north to south; it varies in width from 12.5 km at its widest point along the crest of Mount Hermon in the north to less than 400 m along the Syrian Arab Republic-Jordan border in the south.
The Force is deployed within and close to the area of separation, with 2 base camps, 19 permanently staffed positions and a number of outposts which are staffed only on order as the operational situation requires.
The Force is assisted by Observer Group Golan, part of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), which staffs 11 observation posts along the area of separation.
The Force headquarters is located at Camp Faouar, the main logistics base is located at Camp Ziouani and a representational office is maintained at Damascus.
On each side of the area of separation are areas of limitation, each including three zones.
The first zone of the areas of limitation extends to 10 km from each side of the area of separation, the second extends another 10 km from the first zone and the third extends another 5 km from the second zone.
Members of Observer Group Golan, which is under the operational control of the Force, inspect all parts of the areas of limitation every two weeks to ascertain that the agreed limitations in armaments and forces are being observed by the parties.
