Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Administration of justice in the Secretariat
Report of the Secretary-General
The report of the Secretary-General on the administration of justice in the Secretariat (A/59/449) addresses, inter alia, the recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services following its management review of the appeals process which was conducted in response to General Assembly resolution 57/307, and issued in document A/59/408.
Noting the recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services for additional resources to be allocated to the organizational units involved in the appeals process, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions requested that the General Assembly be provided with the cost implications of those recommendations.
For the biennium 2004-2005, the estimated resource requirements stemming from the recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services are set out in the annex.
In summary, they are as follows:
(a) For the Office of Human Resources Management: $177,800 for general temporary assistance, for eliminating the current backlog in conducting administrative reviews and preparing respondents' replies to the Joint Appeals Board;
(b) For the Geneva and Nairobi Joint Appeals Boards: $133,900 and $106,900, respectively, for general temporary assistance, for eliminating the current backlog in processing and considering appeals;
(c) For the Office of the Under-Secretary-General: $13,500, for general temporary assistance, for eliminating the backlog in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management and for updating the electronic Case and Jurisprudence Digest of Administrative Tribunal Judgements;
(d) For training: $30,000, to be used as start-up costs for training the members of all Joint Appeals Boards (New York, Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi).
The total cost for addressing and eliminating the backlog amounts to $462,100.
This amount will be accommodated from within existing 2004-2005 resources and will thus not entail additional appropriations.
Additional resource requirements for the biennium 2006-2007 amount to $1,021,600.
They are set out in the annex and include the following: 1 P-5 and 1 P-3 for the New York Joint Appeals Board; 1 P-4 for the Panel of Counsel; 1 P-3 for the Administrative Law Unit in the Office of Human Resources Management; the upgrading of a P-2 post to P-3 (Deputy Secretary) for the Geneva Joint Appeals Board; 1 P-3 for the Vienna Joint Appeals Board; and 12 months of general temporary assistance for the Nairobi Joint Appeals Board.
The resources requested for additional general temporary assistance in the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management ($27,000) and for training ($30,000) are proposed to be accommodated from existing resources, including training resources.
The total additional resource requirements of $964,600 ($1,021,600 less $57,000) for the biennium 2006-2007 represent recurring requirements needed to keep cases current and within time limits, thus complying with existing time limits and with the new timelines recommended by the Office of Internal Oversight Services in its management review.
The Organization's compliance with time limits will effectively address the recurring complaint by appellants concerning the chronic delays in the recourse system and will further address the Tribunal's criticism of such delays and its awards of compensation therefor.
These resource estimates will be submitted to the General Assembly in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 and the peacekeeping account for the period 2005-2006.
All efforts will be made to identify offsetting amounts within other areas of the budget to ensure that these proposals would not call for additional resources for the Organization as a whole.
