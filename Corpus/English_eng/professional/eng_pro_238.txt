Financing of the United Nations Operation in Burundi
Budget for the United Nations Operation in Burundi for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 and expenditure report for the period from 21 April to 30 June 2004
Report of the Secretary-General
Contents
Mandate and planned results
The mandate of the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1545 (2004) of 21 May 2004.
The most recent extension of the mandate was authorized by the Council in its resolution 1577 (2004) of 1 December 2004.
ONUB is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to restore lasting peace and bring about national reconciliation in Burundi.
Within this overall objective, ONUB will, during the budget period, contribute to a number of expected accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below.
These frameworks are grouped by components: political process, security sector reform, security environment, human rights and humanitarian assistance as well as support.
The expected accomplishments would lead to the fulfilment of the Security Council's objective within the lifetime of the Operation and the indicators of achievement show a measurement of progress towards such accomplishments during the budget period.
The human resources of the Operation in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the Operation's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Operation as a whole.
Variances in the number of personnel, compared to the 2004/05 budget have been explained under the respective components.
Pursuant to paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 59/15 of 29 October 2004, the present report includes the rejustification, under the executive direction and management and relevant frameworks components, of the following posts: Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian and Development Coordination; Chief of the Communications and Public Information Office; Director in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General; Principal Legal Adviser; Political Affairs Officer in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General; Spokesperson; Political Affairs Officer in the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General; Special Assistant to the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General; Protocol Officer in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General; and Administrative Assistant in the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
The rejustification also reflects the results of the post grade levels review undertaken by the Operation and includes the proposed downgrading of the post of the Principal Legal Adviser from the D-1 to the P-5 level, and the redeployment of one P-3 post (ex-Protocol Officer) from the immediate Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the Joint Mission Analysis Cell.
ONUB is headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the Under-Secretary-General level, assisted by a Principal Deputy Special Representative and a Deputy Special Representative, both at the Assistant Secretary-General level.
Military operations are headed by a Force Commander at the D-2 level while a Police Commissioner at the D-1 level heads the civilian police component of the Operation.
The headquarters for the Operation has been established in the capital, Bujumbura, with five regional offices located in Bujumbura Rurale, Gitega, Ngozi, Muyinga and Makamba.
ONUB provides administrative, logistical and technical support to its substantive, military and civilian police personnel deployed in 56 locations including mission and force headquarters, 5 regional offices, 5 battalion headquarters, 14 military camps and 30 military observer sites throughout the country.
Executive direction and management
Overall mission direction and management is provided by the immediate Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
Attached to the office are other units or components that remain separate from the immediate Office but either report to it or are chaired by the Special Representative.
The largest of these is the Implementation Monitoring Committee, which was created under the Arusha Agreement with its Secretariat transferred to ONUB from the United Nations Office in Burundi (UNOB).
Although the secretariat of the Committee is independent from the Office of the Special Representative, its position within the mission structure flows from the leadership role played by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in chairing the regular Committee sessions.
Additionally, reporting to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General is the Joint Mission Analysis Cell, which comprises both military and civilian staff and provides the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Operation's senior staff with the integrated political/military threat analysis.
The singular importance attached by the Special Representative to ensuring that all ONUB personnel maintain the highest standards of behaviour while serving on mission is reflected by the reporting line from the Code of Conduct Officer to the Office of the Special Representative.
Similarly, the attachment of the strategic planning function and best practices to the Office of the Special Representative provides the mission leadership with effective tools to monitor, manage and advance mandate implementation.

Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
The justification of authorized posts is as follows:
(a) Director.
The Director of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General develops and coordinates on behalf of the Special Representative the key issues of strategic planning, coordinates policy and mission integration issues with the Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, provides strategic advice to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on key issues in the peace process, on issues pertaining to the image of the mission, provides guidance to the Communications and Public Information Office, manages the information flow (all official communications, code cables, weekly video conferences, daily and weekly situation reports) between ONUB and United Nations Headquarters in New York, coordinates discussions of the Contact Group (the principal liaison mechanism between the Transitional Government of Burundi and ONUB), maintains liaison with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) on all issues of mutual concern and coordinates the preparation of quarterly reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council.
With regard to the internal functions, the Director of the Office manages the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and its staff, oversees the implementation of organizational development and personnel management training for senior management and supervisors and advises the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on all sensitive personnel and management issues as well as senior personnel appointments and provides guidance on rules and procedures to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the Deputy Special Representatives and to the heads of offices and sections and prepares weekly meetings with the heads of offices and sections.
In view of the responsibilities of the Director of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, it is proposed to retain this post at the D-1 level;
(b) Principal Legal Adviser.
The Legal Adviser is responsible for providing a broad range of legal advice to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Arusha Agreement, ensures legal support to the monitoring tasks entrusted to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in her functions as the Implementation Monitoring Committee Chairperson in accordance with the Arusha Agreement, as well as all reforms provided for by the Arusha Agreement, reports to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on instances of non-compliance with the Arusha Agreement, interprets and analyses all legal provisions governing the transitional period, maintains close working relationship with the Burundian judicial authorities and provides advice to them on the legislative reform of the judicial system and the extension of State authority throughout the country with a view to ensuring a high standard of compliance with recognized international legal standards in the areas of judicial and administrative reforms.
Legal expertise will also be required in order to create a post-transition monitoring mechanism to replace the Implementation Monitoring Committee.
Upon review of the functions of the post, it is proposed to establish the post of the Legal Adviser at the P-5 level (Senior Legal Adviser);
(c) Political Affairs Officer.
The peace process in Burundi is dependent on the continuing support of the countries of the Great Lakes Regional Peace Initiative on Burundi (Uganda, Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Zambia) and of the Facilitation (South Africa).
Every step of the peace process requires high-level consultations, careful management and coordination with the leadership of those States, which have intervened regularly to support the United Nations efforts in Burundi and keep the peace process on track.
The Political Affairs Officer (P-4) in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General is responsible for supporting the Special Representative in maintaining constant contact and official communications, as well as ensuring close links with the presidents, vice-presidents and foreign ministers of the regional partners.
He/she advises the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on all regional aspects of the peace process, contributes to reporting on regional discussions and initiatives as well as organizes and accompanies the Special Representative on high-level visits to those countries.
Upon review of the responsibilities of the Political Affairs Officer in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, it is proposed to retain this post at the P-4 level.
(d) Protocol Officer.
The Protocol Officer provides advice on all protocol matters to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the Deputy Special Representatives, the Director of the Office of the Special Representative as well as to the Operation's senior management staff, liases with the protocol offices of the presidency and government ministries in support of official functions carried out by the host country's authorities and with the diplomatic corps in Bujumbura, high-level representatives of international and regional governmental and non-governmental organizations and coordinates official in-country events involving Burundian authorities and senior officials of ONUB, supports high-level visits to ONUB and coordinates schedules and agendas of visiting delegations as well as assists in the coordination and organization of protocol events with the relevant authorities of countries to be visited by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
Upon review of the protocol requirements of ONUB, it is proposed to establish the post of the Protocol Officer at the National Officer level, with the authorized P-3 post redeployed to the Joint Mission Analysis Cell to accommodate the proposed position of an Information Analyst (see para.
11 (a) below).
The justification of changes in the staffing establishment is as follows:
(a) Joint Mission Analysis Cell
• International staff: establishment of two posts
The Joint Mission Analysis Cell, unlike the Security Section, which deals with threats of a tangible and immediate nature, aims to bring together the civilian and military components of the mission, thereby strengthening the integration of the mission, to produce a coherent strategic analysis of medium to long-term threats both to the mission and the peace process arising from the activities of armed groups, including the Forces Nationales de Liberation (FNL), and militias that straddle and cross the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Functioning as a “clearing house” for information and analysis from all components of the Mission, the Joint Mission Analysis Cell would be able to draw upon the reporting by military observers and contingents, while the civilian Joint Mission Analysis Cell chief would provide the interpretation of events within the appropriate political context.
Without civilian management the Joint Mission Analysis Cell would remain a primarily military reporting structure inadequate to the task of providing the mission leadership with an integrated political/military threat analysis.
The Joint Mission Analysis Cell would be headed by a Senior Information Analyst (P-5) who would manage the Cell, assigns tasks to Cell staff, oversees the preparation and approves all daily analysis and reports on relevant political and military developments in Burundi and the neighbouring countries and reports on a daily basis to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
The head of the Joint Mission Analysis Cell would be supported by an Information Analyst (P-3) who would develop integrated strategic and ad hoc analysis and contributes to information gathering and reporting as well as maintain close contacts with MONUC (Uvira Office) in order to jointly monitor all cross-border activities.
The Joint Mission Analysis Cell would work in close coordination with the military cell headed by a contingent commander (Colonel) and supported by six Military Information Management Analysts and Officers, one Information Database Officer and two military administrative support personnel.
The proposed staffing establishment of Joint Mission Analysis Cell would be accommodated through the redeployment of one approved P-5 post (ex-Senior Liaison Officer) from the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (see para.
16) and one authorized P-3 post (ex-Protocol Officer) from the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General;
(b) Code of Conduct Officer
• International staff: reclassification of one post from the P-4 to the P-5 level
The Code of Conduct Officer, reporting directly to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, interacts closely with the senior Operation's leadership and all contingent commanders of the mission on matters pertaining to the behaviour and discipline of contingent personnel and civilian staff and compliance with the Code of Conduct, provides regular briefings and induction training for civilian personnel and briefings to incoming contingents, including on disciplinary procedures associated with breaches of the Code of Conduct, undertakes preliminary fact-finding tasks related to all breaches of the Code of Conduct, develops and implements measures to prevent personnel misconduct and enforce standards of conduct throughout the mission area and reports to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and to the Chairman of the mission task force established to implement the United Nations policies on the Code of Conduct.
Taking into account the sensitive nature of the issues involved and given the required level of interaction with the senior civilian and military personnel of ONUB, it is proposed to reclassify the Code of Conduct Officer post from the P-4 to the P-5 level.
(c) Strategic Planning Officer and Best Practices Officer
• International staff: redeployment of two posts
In order to strengthen the strategic planning capacity of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General it is proposed to redeploy the Senior Political Affairs Officer (P-5) post from the Political Affairs Office to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.
The incumbent of the post would assume the functions of the Strategic Planning Officer and would be responsible for the development and preparation of a strategic plan allowing ONUB to manage the implementation of its mandate in a more efficient and effective manner, enabling rapid adjustment to slippages in the national electoral, security and political calendars.
The Best Practices Officer (P-4) is responsible for the monitoring, reporting and implementation of best practices in the Operation, drawing from lessons learned and best practices throughout the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other peacekeeping missions in order to provide options to ONUB to adjust established practices for substantive or administrative activities with a view to achieving best possible results as well as recording of and ensuring sharing of best practices in ONUB.
In view of the cross-cutting responsibilities of the post, it is proposed to redeploy it from the Office of the Principal Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.

The multifaceted and complex nature of the Operation's mandate requires highly professional, extensive, carefully modulated and controlled public information support for all mission components, in particular in the areas of the peace process, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration as well as elections in order to galvanize support among the local population and to reach national, regional and international information networks.
In view of the responsibilities of the post, it is proposed to retain the post of the Chief of Public Information at the D-1 level with responsibilities for media relations delegated to the Spokesperson;
(d) Spokesperson.
Given the weight of the tasks already assumed by the Chief of the Communications and Public Information Office who performs a distinct and more comprehensive function involving all means of communication and public information, and given the high degree of sensitivity and professionalism with which this function needs to be performed, the role of the Spokesperson is viewed as a dedicated, full-time function, carefully and thoughtfully handling all media relations.
The Spokesperson serves as the mission's principal day-to-day public relations liaison with local and international media organizations, which includes arranging for interviews and facilitating contacts between the media and senior mission officials, active engagement of the local, regional and international media in developing and projecting an accurate understanding of the mission's mandate and activities, as well as raising public awareness of core thematic areas within the context of the mission information strategy, identification of trends in news reporting and advice to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on responses, recommendations of appropriate actions to counter and correct misinformation related to the mission and maintenance of regular contacts with the Office of the Spokesperson of the Secretary-General.

Component 5: support
Division of Administration
The approved staffing establishment of the Division of Administration was predicated on the centralized provision from the Operation's headquarters in Bujumbura of administrative, logistical and technical support to the mission's substantive, military and civilian personnel.
Based on the experience gained during the 2004/05 budget period and in view of the deployment of personnel to 56 locations throughout the country, the Division of Administration revised its concept of support operations and undertook a review of its structure and of functional responsibilities of several administrative and integrated support services sections in order to improve responsiveness to support requirements and efficiency of utilization of approved resources.
The resulting changes include the establishment of five regional offices, the construction of an integrated mission headquarters, as well as the proposed establishment within the Division of a facilities management function and consolidation of property management functions.
Table 6 Human resources: component 5, support
a Includes National Officers and national General Service staff.
b Includes the immediate Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, the Board of Inquiry Unit, the Budget Unit and regional administrative officers.
The justification of changes in the staffing establishment is as follows:
(a) Office of the Chief Administrative Officer
Administrative services
A net decrease of one post is attributable to the proposed establishment of a Facilities Management Unit (2 Field Service staff and 2 United Nations Volunteers), the strengthening of the Medical Section (4 United Nations Volunteers and 1 national General Service staff) and the transfer of the Property Control and Inventory Unit (1 P-3, 2 Field Service, 1 General Service (Other level), 2 United Nations Volunteers and 4 national General Service staff) to the Integrated Support Services as explained below.
(b) General Services Section — Facilities Management Unit
(c) Medical Section

Resource requirements
Overall
(Thousands of United States dollars.
Budget year is 1 July to 30 June.
a Cost estimates for 2005/06 are inclusive of a 5 per cent vacancy rate compared with a 25 per cent vacancy rate applied in 2004/05.
b Cost estimates for 2005/06 are inclusive of a 5 per cent vacancy rate compared with a 15 per cent vacancy rate applied in 2004/05.
B. Contingent-owned equipment: major equipment and self-sustainment
Requirements for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 are based on standard reimbursement rates for major equipment and self-sustainment in the total amount of $37,891,900, as follows:
(Thousands of United States dollars)
C. Training
The estimated requirements for training for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 are as follows:
(Thousands of United States dollars)
The training programme developed by the Operation is designed to enhance managerial, administrative and technical competencies throughout ONUB for a total of 308 participants (including 57 participants to be trained outside the mission area).
The primary focus of the programme is to strengthen the technical capacity of mission staff in finance, personnel, procurement, property management, supply management, communications and information technology, air operations, transport and security and to improve conflict prevention skills.
D. Non-budgeted contributions
A status-of-forces agreement between the Government of Burundi and ONUB is currently under negotiation and is expected to be finalized shortly.
Pending conclusion of the agreement and determination of the Government's contribution, no provision for non-budgeted voluntary contributions has been included in 2005/06.
Analysis of variances
• Management: full deployment of military observers
The main factor contributing to the variance of $995,400 under this heading is the projected full deployment of the authorized strength of 200 military observers compared to the phased deployment during 2004/05.
The estimated resource requirements reflect a 3 per cent delayed deployment factor applied to the computation of mission subsistence allowance costs.
• Management: full deployment of military contingents
The main factors contributing to the variance of $1,844,800 under this heading are reduced requirements for the freight of contingent-owned equipment deployed during 2004/05 and for the emplacement of contingent personnel, the downward adjustment of estimated requirements for the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for contingent-owned equipment costs based on the actual signed and draft memorandums of understanding, offset by the projected full deployment of the Operation's authorized troop strength of 5,450 contingent personnel, including 125 military staff officers, compared with the phased deployment during 2004/05 and a provision for mission subsistence allowance for military staff officers.
The estimated resource requirements reflect a 2 per cent delayed deployment factor applied to the computation of troop costs.
• Management: full deployment of civilian police
The main factor contributing to the variance of $1,196,300 under this heading is the projected full deployment of the authorized strength of 119 civilian police compared with the phased deployment during 2004/05.
The estimated resource requirements reflect a 3 per cent delayed deployment factor applied to the computation of mission subsistence allowance costs.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $17,792,400 under this heading is the projected full deployment of all international staff approved for 2004/05, combined with provisions for the proposed increase of the staffing establishment of the mission by seven posts and offset by the repatriation of 16 electoral assistance staff after 1 October 2005.
The estimated requirements reflect the application to the computation of international staff costs of a 5 per cent delayed recruitment factor, compared with a 25 per cent delayed recruitment factor in 2004/05 and are based, given that the Operation was established in June 2004, on salary and staff assessment rates derived from the actual average expenditure by staff category and grade levels in 2003/04 across all peacekeeping operations (excluding the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and established missions).
Common staff costs, including hazardous duty station allowance, have been estimated at some 84 per cent of net salaries for international staff.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $3,832,600 under this heading is the projected full deployment of all national staff approved for 2004/05, combined with provisions for the proposed increase of the national staffing establishment by 23 posts and offset by the separation of 74 electoral assistance staff after 1 October 2005.
The estimated requirements reflect the application to the computation of national staff costs of a 5 per cent delayed recruitment factor, compared with a 15 per cent delayed recruitment factor in 2004/05 and are based on the established national staff salary scales for national General Service staff (G-5/step 5) and National Officers (NOB/step 4).
Common staff costs including hazardous duty station allowance have been estimated at some 34 per cent of net salaries for national staff.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $154,800 under this heading is the repatriation of 35 electoral assistance United Nations Volunteers after 1 October 2005, partially offset by the proposed increase of the United Nations Volunteers staffing establishment by 26 posts and the application to the computation of United Nations Volunteers costs of a 5 per cent delayed recruitment factor, compared with a 10 per cent delayed recruitment factor in 2004/05.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $70,000 under this heading is the increase in the number (from 46 to 50) and employment duration (from 10 to 12 months) of hired language assistants to support non-francophone military contingents in connection with their projected full deployment.
• Management: reduced inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $338,400 under this heading is the reduced employment of international and national consultants in the light of the expertise that ONUB has established in the areas of electoral assistance, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration/security sector reform, gender issues and humanitarian assistance.
• Management: reduced inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $352,400 under this heading is the reduced travel requirements attributable to the review by the mission of the official and training-related travel programmes, including travel from United Nations Headquarters in New York.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $31,607,900 under this heading is reduced requirements for facilities and infrastructure acquisitions, procurement action in respect of which will be completed during 2004/05, as well as a significant reduction in petrol, oil and lubricant requirements for generators based on the mission experience in 2004/05, partially offset by an increase in construction and maintenance services owing to the establishment of five regional offices (the 2004/05 budget included no provisions for regional offices) and the establishment of an integrated mission headquarters in Bujumbura.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $11,678,400 under this heading is reduced requirements for the acquisition of vehicles, procurement action in respect of which will be completed during 2004/05, offset by provisions for the replacement of 15 vehicles to be written off during the budget period.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $2,498,300 under this heading is the deployment of two additional armed light helicopters required to support six unarmed helicopters when operating in hostile areas where no ground support protection can be provided, as well as for patrol and surveillance tasks and casualty and medical evacuation.
• Management: additional inputs and outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $462,000 under this heading is the increased requirement for petrol, oil and lubricants based on the operational need for five daily harbour patrols and two border patrols on Lake Tanganyika in 2005/06, compared with two daily harbour patrols in 2004/05.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $9,281,100 under this heading is reduced requirements for the acquisition of communications equipment, procurement action in respect of which will be completed during 2004/05, as well as lower requirements for commercial communications based on mission experience.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $3,223,100 under this heading is reduced requirements for the acquisition of information technology equipment, procurement action in respect of which will be completed during 2004/05.
The estimated resource requirements for 2005/06 provide for the replacement of 38 desktop computers and monitors, 109 printers and 116 miscellaneous items of equipment to be written off owing to the age and condition of the equipment.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $1,103,300 under this heading is the decrease in military contingent's self-sustainment requirements based on the actual signed and draft memorandums of understanding.
• Management: reduced inputs and same outputs
The main factor contributing to the variance of $347,700 under this heading is reduced requirements for the acquisition of other equipment, personal protection gear and freight costs which are partially offset by an increase in the cost estimate for uniforms, flags and decals, requirements for mine detection and mine clearing services provided by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and bank charges based on mission experience.

Summary
The present report contains the budget for the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, which amounts to $296,654,700.
The budget provides for the deployment of 200 military observers, 5,450 military contingent personnel, 120 civilian police, 406 international staff, 446 national staff, including 45 National Officers, and 198 United Nations Volunteers.
The total resource requirements for ONUB for the financial period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 have been linked to the Operation's objective through a number of results-based frameworks, grouped by components: political process, security sector reform, security environment, human rights and humanitarian assistance as well as support.
The human resources of the Operation in terms of number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the Operation's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Operation as a whole.
The explanations of variances in resource levels, both human resources and financial resources, have been linked, where applicable, to specific outputs planned by the Operation.
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 59/15 of 29 October 2004 on the financing of ONUB, the present report includes the rejustification, under the executive direction and management and relevant frameworks components, of the posts identified in paragraph 9 of the resolution, including proposed grade level adjustments, where applicable.

Reference
The present section describes the single largest contributing factor of each resource variance according to specific standard options encompassed in the four standard categories listed below:
Mandate:variances caused by changes in the scale or scope of the mandate, or changes in the expected accomplishments as driven by the mandate External:variances caused by parties or situations external to the United Nations Cost parameters:variances caused by United Nations regulations, rules and policies Management:variances caused by management actions to achieve planned results more effectively (e.g., by reprioritizing or adding certain outputs) or efficiently (e.g., by taking measures to reduce personnel or operational inputs while maintaining the same level of outputs), and/or from performance related issues (e.g., by having underestimated the costs or quantities of inputs required to produce a certain level of outputs, or by delayed recruitment)
