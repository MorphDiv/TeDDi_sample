Fifty-ninth session
Agenda items 45 and 55
Integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields
Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit
Draft outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly of September 2005 submitted by the President of the General Assembly
Values and principles
We, Heads of State and Government, have gathered at United Nations Headquarters in New York from 14 to 16 September 2005.
Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration we adopted at the dawn of the twenty-first century, we reaffirm our faith in the Organization and our commitment to the Charter, including principles and values underpinning international relations, such as freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature and shared responsibility.
Recognizing the valuable role and achievement accomplished by the major United Nations conferences and summits in mobilizing the international community at the local, national, regional and global levels and in guiding the work of the United Nations in the economic, social, human rights, environmental and related fields, we renew our commitment to fully implement their outcomes.
We reaffirm the vital importance of an effective multilateral system, with a strong United Nations at its core, in order to better address the multifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats confronting our world and achieve progress in the areas of development, security and human rights.
We believe that today, more than ever before, we live in a global and interdependent world.
No State can stand wholly alone.
We acknowledge that collective security depends on effective cooperation against transnational threats.
We recognize that we all share responsibility for each other's security.
We agree that current developments and circumstances require that we urgently build consensus on major threats and challenges.
We commit to translate that consensus into concrete action.
We pledge to rapidly strengthen the United Nations in order to make it more effective and more credible.
This is our shared responsibility and our common interest.
We acknowledge that development, security and human rights form the indispensable foundations for collective security and well-being and that they are the pillars of the United Nations system.
We equally recognize that development is a central goal by itself and we commit ourselves to fully implement the United Nations development agenda, including the Millennium Development Goals.
We acknowledge that our nations and peoples will not enjoy development without security, nor will they enjoy security without development, and that they will not enjoy either without respect for human rights.
We reaffirm that gender equality and the promotion and protection of the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for women are essential to advance development, security and human rights.
We reaffirm that all cultures and civilizations can contribute to the enrichment of humankind.
We acknowledge the importance of recognizing ethnic, religious and cultural diversity throughout the world and the need to encourage dialogue, understanding, tolerance and respect among different cultures and civilizations as a means to promote international peace and security.
We therefore resolve to take concrete measures in the four following areas:
• Development
• Peace and collective security
• Human rights and rule of law
• Strengthening of the United Nations
Development
Concerned by the slow and uneven implementation of the global development agenda and reaffirming our commitment to eradicate poverty and promote development and global prosperity for all:
Global partnership for development
We strongly reiterate our determination to ensure the timely and full realization of the development goals and objectives that emerged from the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Development Goals, which have galvanized unprecedented efforts towards meeting the needs of the world's poorest.
We reaffirm the global partnership for achieving these goals, as agreed in 2002 at the International Conference on Financing for Development.
In the spirit of this partnership, we reaffirm that each country must take primary responsibility for its own economic and social development.
We recognize also that national efforts should be complemented by supportive global programmes and policies aiming at maximizing the development opportunities of countries.
To those ends we resolve to:
• Adopt by 2006 and begin to implement comprehensive national development strategies to achieve the development goals and objectives by 2015
• Strengthen governance, combat corruption at the national and international levels and put in place policies and investments to drive growth and stimulate the private sector and employment generation and maximize domestic resources to fund national development strategies
• Encourage, starting in 2005, efforts by developing countries to put forward sound, transparent and accountable national strategies and support those endeavours through increased development assistance, a development-focused outcome of the Doha round of trade negotiations and wider and deeper debt relief
• Support developing countries by providing a sufficient increase in aid of sufficient quality and arriving with sufficient speed to enable them to achieve the Millennium Development Goals
Financing for development
Reaffirming the Monterrey Consensus, we recognize that mobilizing financial resources for development is central to the achievement of these goals, and to that end we:
• Welcome the establishment of timetables by developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance by no later than 2015 and to reach at least 0.5 per cent by 2009, and invite those developed countries that have not yet done so to strive to establish timetables and to make concrete efforts to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent; also urge developed countries to achieve the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance to least developed countries
• Support recent efforts and initiatives to enhance the quality and increase the impact of aid, such as the Paris Declaration of the High-level Forum on Joint Progress Toward Enhanced Aid Effectiveness, and decide to take concrete and effective action in implementing all agreed commitments on aid effectiveness, including through further aligning assistance with country strategies, streamlining conditionalities, building institutional capacities and strengthening the focus on development results
• Recognize the need for increased and more predictable resources, and in that regard take note with interest of international efforts, contributions and discussions aimed at identifying innovative and additional sources of financing for development on a public, private, domestic or external basis
• Underline the urgent need for increased investment now, and therefore for immediate front-loading of additional official development assistance commitments and, in that regard, welcome the decision to launch, in 2005, an international finance facility to support the immediate front-loading of official development assistance commitments and encourage broad participation, welcome the pilot project of an international solidarity contribution from plane tickets to finance the fight against HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, and decide to consider other solidarity contributions that would be nationally applied and internationally coordinated
• Stress that in assessing debt sustainability, consideration should be given to the level of debt that allows a country both to achieve its national development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and to reach 2015 without an increase in its debt ratios, taking into account the new debt sustainability framework devised by multilateral institutions, which aims in particular at increasing grant-based financing and at the cancellation of 100 per cent of the official debt of most heavily indebted poor countries, as well as a significant reduction in debt for many heavily indebted countries that do not fall under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, including middle-income developing countries; this should be achieved without reducing the resources available to other developing countries and without jeopardizing the long-term financial viability of international financial institutions
• Undertake to complete the World Trade Organization's Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations no later than 2006, with a full commitment to realize its development focus, including in critical areas identified in the Organization's General Council decision on the Doha work programme of 1 August 2004
• Decide to provide immediate duty-free and quota-free market access for all exports from the least developed countries
• Decide to support and promote increased aid to build productive and trade capacities of developing countries and to take further steps in that regard
• Undertake measures to promote and sustain adequate and stable international capital flows to developing countries, particularly countries in Africa, least developed countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, and to countries with economies in transition
• Agree to support country-led “quick-win” initiatives consistent with long-term national development strategies so as to realize major immediate progress towards development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, through such measures, as the free distribution of bed nets and effective antimalarial medicines, the expansion of home-grown school meals programmes using locally produced foods and the elimination of user fees for primary education and health services
We stress the commitment contained in the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development to broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in international economic decision-making and norm-setting, and to that end undertake to find pragmatic and innovative ways to enhance the effective participation of those countries in international decision-making, particularly in the Bretton Woods institutions, and through the speedy accession of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to the World Trade Organization.
We undertake to operationalize the World Solidarity Fund established by the General Assembly.
Employment
We resolve to make the goal of productive employment and decent work a central objective of our national and international macroeconomic policies, as well as poverty reduction strategies.
Sustaining our environment and natural resources base for development
We reaffirm our commitment to achieve the goal of sustainable development, including through the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.
We therefore resolve to:
• Undertake concerted global action to mitigate climate change, including through meeting all commitments and obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other relevant international agreements, increase energy efficiency and technological innovation and initiate negotiations to develop a more inclusive international framework for climate change beyond 2012, with broader participation by both developing and developed countries, including all relevant emitters, and taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities
• Continue to assist developing countries, particularly small island developing States, LDCs and landlocked developing countries in Africa in addressing their adaptation needs relating to the adverse effects of climate change
• Combat desertification by supporting the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa
• Implement the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Johannesburg commitment to significantly reduce the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010
• Establish a worldwide early warning system for all natural hazards with regional nodes, building on existing national and regional capacity, by 2006, and commit to fully implementing the Hyogo Declaration and Hyogo Framework for Action adopted at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction
• Decide to facilitate access to water for all and to accelerate the preparation of national integrated water-management and water-efficiency plans
• Decide to improve access to reliable, affordable, economically viable and environmentally sound energy services
HIV/AIDS and other health issues
We recognize that HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases pose severe risks for the entire world and serious challenges to the achievement of development goals.
These diseases and other emerging health challenges require a concerted international response.
To that end we commit ourselves to:
• Ensure that the resources needed for prevention, treatment, enhanced access to affordable medicines and an expanded and comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS and for full funding of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are provided universally by 2010
• Strengthen global disease outbreak surveillance and response capacity by increasing resources for the World Health Organization Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network
• Launch a global initiative to strengthen the national health systems in developing countries
• Achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015, as set out in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, integrating this goal into strategies to attain the international development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration aiming at improving maternal health, reducing child mortality, promoting gender equality, combating HIV/AIDS and eradicating poverty
Gender equality and empowerment of women
We reaffirm that the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action is essential to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and resolve to promote gender equality and to overcome pervasive gender bias by:
• Increasing primary school completion and secondary school access for girls and ensuring secure tenure of property to women
• Ensuring access to reproductive health
• Promoting equal access to labour markets
• Providing opportunity for greater representation in Government decision-making bodies
• Supporting direct interventions to protect women from violence
We recognize the importance of gender mainstreaming as a tool for achieving gender equality.
To that end, we undertake to actively promote mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and social spheres.
Science and technology for development
We recognize that science and technology play a critical role in the achievement of the development goals and that international support is essential for enabling developing countries to benefit from technological advancements.
We therefore commit to:
• Launch a global initiative to support research and development to address the special needs of the poor in the areas of health, agriculture, natural resources and environmental management, energy and the impact of climate change
• Promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, access to and the development, transfer and diffusion of technologies and corresponding know-how to developing countries
• Create an inclusive information society, put the potential of information and communication technology at the service of development, address new challenges of the information society and ensure the success of the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, to be held in Tunis in November 2005
Migration
We recognize that international migration brings many benefits to the global community as well as complex challenges.
We further recognize the need to enhance international cooperation on migration issues to ensure that the movement of people across borders is managed in a more effective and humane manner.
We reaffirm the commitment to implement the Habitat Agenda and the Cities without Slums initiative to assist developing countries in coping with rapid urbanization and associated migration within and between countries.
In that regard, we resolve to ensure the success of the General Assembly's high-level dialogue on international migration and development in 2006 with a view to identifying ways in which the effective and equitable management of migration can be promoted at the national, regional and international levels.
Countries with special needs
We recognize the special needs of and challenges faced by the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, and therefore reaffirm our commitment to urgently address those needs and challenges through the full, timely and effective implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action, the Almaty Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for the further implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action.
We also emphasize the need for continued international support for achieving the development goals in countries emerging from conflict and recovering from disasters.
Meeting the special needs of Africa
Reaffirming our commitment to urgently meet the special needs of Africa to enable it to enter the mainstream of the world economy, we resolve to:
• Strengthen cooperation with the New Partnership for Africa's Development through coherent support for the programmes drawn up by the African leaders within that framework, including by mobilizing external financial resources and facilitating approval of such programmes by the multilateral financial institution
• Promote a comprehensive and durable solution to the external debt problems of African countries, including through the cancellation of 100 per cent of multilateral debt, consistent with the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
• Make efforts to fully integrate African countries into the international trading system, including through targeted capacity-building programmes on bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations
• Commit to support the efforts of commodity-dependent African countries to restructure, diversify and strengthen the competitiveness of their commodity sectors and decide to work towards market-based arrangements with the participation of the private sector for commodity price risk management
• Supplement the efforts of African countries, individually and collectively, to increase agricultural productivity in a sustainable way as part of an African “green revolution” to be launched in 2005
• Encourage and support the African regional and subregional organizations' initiatives to prevent, mediate and resolve conflicts with the assistance of the United Nations
• Attach priority to providing assistance for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment in African countries on a grant basis, encourage pharmaceutical companies to make antiretroviral drugs affordable and accessible in Africa and ensure increased support for bilateral and multilateral assistance to combat malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in Africa
Peace and collective security
We recognize that we are facing a whole range of threats, including poverty, armed conflicts between and within States, the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the lack of progress in disarmament, terrorism and organized crime, the rapid spread of highly infectious diseases and severe environmental degradation, that require our urgent, collective and more determined response.
We acknowledge that we are living in an interdependent and global world and that today's threats recognize no national boundaries, are interlinked and must be tackled at the global, regional and national levels.
We therefore reaffirm our commitment to implement a security consensus based on the recognition that threats are interlinked, that development, security and human rights are mutually dependent, that no State can best protect itself by acting entirely alone and that all States need an effective, equitable and efficient collective security system, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.
We resolve to take concerted action, through such a system of collective security, based on the Charter, to prevent, mitigate and remove threats to peace and security, economic development and human freedom, and to provide effective security for all States and peoples.
Protecting children in armed conflicts
We renew our resolve to promote and protect the right and welfare of children in armed conflicts and call upon all States to take effective measures to prevent the recruitment and use of children by armed groups and to prohibit and criminalize such practices.
We also reaffirm our commitment to ensure that children in armed conflicts receive timely and effective humanitarian assistance and to take effective measures for their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
Peaceful resolution of disputes
We call upon Member States to settle their disputes by peaceful means in accordance with Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, including, when appropriate, by the most effective use of the International Court of Justice.
We call upon States to refrain from all uses of force contrary to the Charter.
All States shall also act in ways consistent with the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
We stress the importance of conflict prevention and solemnly renew our commitment to promote a culture of prevention as a means of effectively addressing the interconnected security and development challenges faced by peoples throughout the world, to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations for conflict prevention and to ensure that prevention is a centrepiece of effective multilateralism and United Nations reform.
We further stress the importance of a comprehensive approach to the prevention of armed conflicts and the need for the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Secretariat to coordinate, within their respective Charter mandates, their activities.
Recognizing the important role of the Secretary-General's good offices in the mediation of the peaceful resolution of disputes, we decide to support the Secretary-General's efforts to strengthen his capacity to engage in good offices and mediation.
Role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts
We stress the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding.
We also underline the importance of women's equal participation and full involvement in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security, as well as the need to increase their role in decision-making.
Peacekeeping
Recognizing that peacekeeping plays a vital role in helping parties to conflict end hostilities, noting improvements made in recent years to United Nations peacekeeping and stressing the need to mount operations with adequate capacity to counter hostilities, we express support for the establishment of a standby capacity for the rapid deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces and civilian police.
Recognizing the vital contribution to peace and security being made by regional organizations and the importance of forging predictable partnerships between the United Nations and regional organizations, and noting in particular, given the special needs of Africa, the importance of a strong African Union, we agree to:
• Support the efforts of the European Union and other regional entities to develop standby capacities
• Develop and implement a 10-year plan for capacity-building with the African Union
Peacebuilding
Emphasizing the vital role that the United Nations plays in helping parties to end hostilities and to move from conflict towards recovery and development, we decide to:
• Establish a Peacebuilding Commission to provide sustained international attention and support to countries in the transition from post-conflict situations to recovery and long-term development.
The Peacebuilding Commission should be advisory in nature.
In respect of country-specific situations, the Peacebuilding Commission should, in the immediate aftermath of conflict, make recommendations to the Security Council regarding measures to ensure coherence between peacekeeping, economic recovery and efforts to restore national institutions for public administration and the rule of law.
It should periodically review progress towards medium-term recovery goals and help to ensure adequate financing.
It should extend political attention to recovery beyond the period of dedicated attention by the Security Council, working with the Economic and Social Council and other bodies as relevant, and should report on country-specific issues to the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council in sequence, depending on the phase of the conflict.
On general issues, the Peacebuilding Commission should make recommendations on peacebuilding policy to the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly within their areas of competence
• Support the establishment of a multi-year standing fund for peacebuilding
• Request the Secretary-General to establish a Peacebuilding Support Office within the Secretariat
We request the President of the General Assembly, assisted by the Secretary-General, to conduct consultations with Member States in order to develop the necessary modalities for the effective operation of the Peacebuilding Commission, including its composition, its rules of procedure and financial arrangements for its functioning, so that the body can begin operations no later than 31 December 2005.
Sanctions
We agree that sanctions remain an important tool in our efforts to maintain international peace and security without recourse to the use of force, and declare our intention to ensure that sanctions are carefully targeted in support of clear objectives, subject to time limits, where appropriate, and are implemented and monitored effectively with clear benchmarks and accountability, to comply with sanctions established by the Security Council, and to ensure that sanctions are implemented in ways that mitigate the adverse consequences for populations and third States.
We call upon the Security Council, with the support of the Secretary-General, to improve its monitoring of the implementation and effects of sanctions, to ensure that sanctions are implemented in an accountable manner and to review regularly the results of such monitoring.
We also call upon the Security Council and the Secretary-General to ensure that fair and transparent procedures exist for placing individuals and entities on sanctions lists and for removing them.
We agree to support efforts through United Nations agencies to strengthen State capacity to implement sanctions provisions.
Use of force
We reaffirm that the purposes and principles guiding the United Nations are to maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.
We also reaffirm that the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations regarding the use of force are sufficient to address the full range of security threats and agree that the use of force should be considered as an instrument of last resort.
We further reaffirm the authority of the Security Council to take action to maintain and restore international peace and security, in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the Charter.
We recognize the need to continue discussing principles for the use of force, as identified by the Secretary-General, and that such principles should be among the factors considered by the Security Council in deciding to authorize the use of force in accordance with the Charter.
Disarmament and non-proliferation
We appeal to all States to pursue and intensify negotiations with a view to advancing general and complete disarmament and strengthening the international non-proliferation regime.
We urge all States to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and we pledge to comply fully with all the articles of those conventions in order to strengthen the multilateral framework for non-proliferation and disarmament and to achieve full adherence to the conventions.
We resolve therefore to:
• Appeal to all States to take action to eliminate the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
• Also appeal to the nuclear weapon States to take concrete steps towards nuclear disarmament in accordance with article VI of the non-proliferation treaty with the objective of eliminating all such weapons
• Intensify efforts to negotiate a fissile material cut-off treaty
• Maintain an indefinite moratorium on nuclear test explosions pending the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and call upon all States to accede to the Treaty
• Strengthen verification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by accepting the Model Additional Protocol, the standard for compliance, and to conclude such protocol without delay
• Support and continue to work towards the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in order to prevent proliferation and advance disarmament
• Strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention through continued efforts to improve national implementation
• Complete the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles consistent with the Chemical Weapons Convention in a timely and effective manner
• Prevent non-State actors from gaining access to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, technology and materials or their means of delivery, including by complying with Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)
• Promote timely agreement to prevent the spread of uranium enrichment and plutonium separation technologies and facilities and seek alternatives that respect fully the right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy as set out in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, such as the provision of guaranteed nuclear fuel supplies and other incentives
• Call for universal accession to the comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols, and recognize that comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols have a deterrent effect on nuclear proliferation and form today's verification standard
• Explore effective measures to prevent an arms race in outer space
• Explore effective measures to prevent and combat the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, technology and materials and rockets and shoulder-fired missiles, as well as to ban their transfer to non-State actors, including by implementing effective national export controls
We agree to develop a legally binding international instrument to regulate the marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons, as well as one to combat illicit brokering.
We urge States parties to fully implement their obligations under the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.
We invite all States to take and implement confidence-building and disarmament measures.
Terrorism
We reject terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and commit to endorse and implement the comprehensive United Nations counter-terrorism strategy proposed by the Secretary-General, taking fully into account the need to address factors that may contribute to terrorism, including poverty, political and economic injustice and foreign occupation.
We recognize that the targeting and deliberate killing of civilians and non-combatants cannot be justified or legitimized by any cause or grievance, and we declare that any action that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants, when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population or to compel a Government or an international organization to carry out or to abstain from any act cannot be justified on any grounds.
We invite the Secretary-General to consult further with the General Assembly and the Security Council to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations, its specialized agencies and States to prevent terrorism.
We will strive to conclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly, but not later than June 2006.
We agree to sign the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism with a view to its early entry into force and to accede to the 12 other international conventions against terrorism as soon as possible.
We recognize the importance of adhering to the principles of good governance, respect for human rights and the rule of law in the fight against terrorism.
Transnational crime
We urge all countries to accede to the relevant international conventions on organized crime and corruption and to implement them effectively, including by incorporating the provisions of those conventions into national legislation and by strengthening criminal justice systems.
We decide to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to provide assistance to Member States in those tasks.
Human rights and rule of law
We commit ourselves to promote and respect human rights, the rule of law and democracy, and recognize that they constitute together core values and principles of the United Nations and that no security agenda or drive for development will be successful unless they are based on respect for human dignity.
We also recognize the need for universal adherence to human rights as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and for the full implementation of the human rights standards contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other pertinent human rights instruments.
Human rights
We resolve further to strengthen the United Nations human rights system with the aim of ensuring effective enjoyment by all of all human rights — civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, as well as the right to development.
We resolve to strengthen the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to enable it to effectively respond to the broad range of human rights challenges facing the international community, particularly at the level of field offices in the areas of technical assistance and capacity-building, through increased resources and staff under the regular budget.
We resolve to improve the effectiveness of the human rights treaty bodies, including through improved and streamlined reporting procedures, and to promote the implementation of their recommendations.
Rule of law
Recognizing the need for universal adherence to and implementation of the rule of law at both the national and international levels, we pledge to:
• Reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and an international order based on rules and the rule of law, which is essential for peaceful coexistence and cooperation among States
• Support the annual treaty event and encourage any Government that has not done so to agree to ratify and implement all treaties relating to the protection of civilians
• Welcome the establishment of a rule of law assistance unit within the Secretariat to strengthen United Nations activities to promote the rule of law through technical assistance and capacity-building
• Recognize the important role of the International Court of Justice in adjudicating disputes among States, call upon States that have not yet done so to consider recognizing the jurisdiction of the Court and to make greater use of the Court's advisory opinions, and agree to consider means of strengthening the Court's work, including by supporting a voluntary trust fund to assist States in the settlement of disputes
• Recognize the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement as the basic international norm for the protection of internally displaced persons and commitments to promote the incorporation of those principles through national legislation and national practices
Democracy
We reaffirm that democracy is a universal value, implying the will of the peoples to express and decide freely their own political system, and does not belong to any country or region.
We commit to support democracy in our own countries, our regions and the world, and resolve to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to assist Member States on request.
We therefore welcome the establishment of a Democracy Fund at the United Nations and invite the Secretary-General to establish an advisory board to provide policy guidance and funding guidelines.
We invite Member States to contribute to the Democracy Fund.
Impunity
Recognizing that justice is a vital component of the rule of law, we commit to end impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law, such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, by cooperating with the work of the International Criminal Court, the existing ad hoc and mixed war crimes tribunals and other mechanisms for international justice.
Responsibility to protect
We agree that the responsibility to protect civilian populations lies first and foremost with each individual State.
The international community should, as necessary, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility.
The international community also has the responsibility to use diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means under Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter to help protect civilian populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
If such peaceful means appear insufficient, we recognize our shared responsibility to take collective action, through the Security Council and, as appropriate, in cooperation with relevant regional organizations, under Chapter VII of the Charter.
We support the implementation of the United Nations Action Plan to Prevent Genocide.
We stress the need to continue consideration within the General Assembly of the concept of the responsibility to protect.
Human security
We stress the freedom of people to live in dignity.
We recognize that human security is a guiding principle of the vital need to protect civilian populations from the many insecurities generated by current threats and challenges affecting people's lives.
We therefore commit to promote human security as a means to empower people and address effectively those insecurities.
Culture of peace and initiatives on dialogue among cultures and civilizations
Recognizing the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace adopted by the General Assembly and the value of different initiatives on dialogue among cultures and civilizations, we commit to take action to promote a culture of peace at the national level, as well as at the regional and international levels, and request the Secretary-General to explore enhancing implementation mechanisms and to follow-up on those initiatives.
Strengthening the United Nations
We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen the United Nations with a view to enhancing its capacity to address effectively the full range of the challenges of our time.
We are determined to reinvigorate the intergovernmental organs of the United Nations and to adapt them to the needs of the twenty-first century.
We agree that, in order to efficiently perform their respective mandates as provided under the Charter, the main organs should not duplicate their work with other bodies but should rather develop good cooperation in the common endeavour of building a more effective United Nations.
General Assembly
We reaffirm the central position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policymaking, decision-making and representative organ of the United Nations.
We therefore welcome the measures adopted by the General Assembly with a view to strengthening its role and authority and enabling the President of the General Assembly to play a leadership role and, to that end, we call for their full and speedy implementation.
We call for the creation of a constructive relationship between the General Assembly and the other principal organs to ensure better coordination on topical issues that require coordinated action by the United Nations.
We stress the need to demonstrate the political will to effectively implement the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly.
Security Council
We reaffirm that Member States have conferred on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, acting on their behalf, as provided by the Charter.
We endorse comprehensive reform of the Security Council to make it more broadly representative and more transparent so as to enhance the legitimacy of its decisions and its effectiveness.
We recommend that the Security Council adapt its working methods so as to increase the involvement of States not members of the Security Council in its preparatory work, enhance its accountability to the membership and increase the transparency of its work.
Economic and Social Council
We reaffirm the role that the Charter and the General Assembly have vested in the Economic and Social Council as the principal organ for coordination, policy review and policy dialogue, for economic and social development and for implementing the international development goals agreed at major summits and conferences.
We agree that the Council will:
• Hold annual ministerial-level policy coordinating meetings to carry out substantive reviews of existing global policies and assessments of progress towards the implementation of the outcomes of major conferences and summits and internationally agreed development goals during its high-level segment, including a pilot process of voluntary peer reviews of progress, drawing on its functional and regional commissions, as well as other international institutions
• Convert biennially its operational segment into a high-level development cooperation forum to review trends in international development cooperation, including strategies, policies and financing, to promote greater coherence among the development activities of different development partners and to strengthen the links between the normative and operational work of the United Nations
• Convene timely meetings to address threats to development, including humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters, in order to promote improved coordinated responses from the United Nations
• Strengthen its work in post-conflict management by working with the Peacebuilding Commission
• Play a major role in the overall coordination of funds, programmes and agencies, ensuring coherence among them and avoiding duplication of mandates and activities
Human Rights Council
Recognizing the need to give greater priority to human rights in the work of the United Nations, we decide to elevate the Commission on Human Rights to a standing Human Rights Council as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly based in Geneva, pending a decision that the Assembly might take on the establishment of a main Charter body reflecting the centrality of human rights in the United Nations system.
We therefore decide that:
• The members of the Council shall be elected directly by the General Assembly, by a two thirds majority on the basis of equitable geographic representation, and be comparable in size to the Commission on Human Rights
• The Council shall discuss any matters or situations related to the promotion and protection of human rights and make recommendations thereon to the Member States of the United Nations and provide policy recommendations to the United Nations system through the General Assembly
• The Council shall fulfil its responsibility on the basis of the principle that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and must be treated in a fair and equal manner
• The Council shall have the ability to periodically review the fulfilment of all human rights obligations of all Member States
• The arrangements made by the Economic and Social Council for consultations with non-governmental organizations under Article 71 of the Charter shall apply to the Human Rights Council
• The Human Rights Council shall preserve the strengths of the Commission on Human Rights, including the system of special procedures
We mandate the General Assembly to elaborate further in order to adopt during its sixtieth session the modalities, functions, procedures and working methods, as well as the composition, of the proposed Human Rights Council.
Secretariat
Recognizing that a capable and effective Secretariat is indispensable to the work of the United Nations in a fast-changing world, we fully support the Secretary-General in his goal of achieving the highest levels of competence, integrity, ethical behaviour, efficiency, transparency and accountability of the Secretariat, with due regard to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide and equitable a geographical basis as possible, and commend the Secretary-General's efforts to further enhance the effective management of the United Nations and for his commitment to modernize the Headquarters.
We agree to provide the Secretary-General with sufficient authority and flexibility to carry out his managerial responsibilities and leadership under relevant regulations established by the General Assembly, and expect the Secretary-General to provide Member States with a full system of accountability.
We invite the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly an overview of all mandates older than five years with an indication of which resources could be shifted to other priorities, in accordance with the rules and regulations on programme planning, in order to strengthen and update the programme of work of the Organization.
We emphasize that, in order to facilitate management, a full review of the budgetary and human resources rules under which the Organization operates should be finalized as soon as possible and submitted to the General Assembly for its decision at the sixtieth session.
We request the Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive proposal on the general concept of a one-time staff buyout to modernize and improve personnel structure and quality, including an indication of the costs involved, and to submit it to the General Assembly for its decision at the sixtieth session.
We invite the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly on the impact of his proposals for management reform aimed at improving accountability, transparency and efficiency within the Secretariat, including a review of the Office of Internal Oversight Services with a view to strengthening its independence, authority, expertise and capacity.
We welcome the commitment of the Secretary-General to secure a just gender balance in the staffing of the Organization.
We encourage the Secretary-General and all decision-making bodies to take further steps in mainstreaming a gender perspective in the policies and decisions of the Organization.
We insist on the highest standards of behaviour on the part of personnel deployed to United Nations missions, and welcome the Secretary-General's zero- tolerance policy regarding sexual exploitation and abuse in all United Nations activities.
We recognize the selfless commitment of United Nations staff, and strongly condemn all violent attacks against the security of personnel engaged in United Nations operations.
We resolve to promote adherence to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel and to conclude negotiations on a protocol expanding the scope of their legal protection during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.
System-wide coherence
We recognize that the United Nations brings together a unique wealth of expertise and resources on global issues.
We agree to ensure stronger system-wide coherence by implementing the following measures at the policy, operational and humanitarian as well as international environmental governance, levels:
Policy
• Strengthening linkages between the normative work of the United Nations system and its operational activities
• Coordinating our representation on the governing boards of the various development and humanitarian agencies so as to ensure that they pursue a coherent policy in assigning mandates and allocating resources throughout the system
• Committing to pledge funding in a more predictable manner
• Recognizing the need for a more unified United Nations country presence
Operational and humanitarian system
• Committing ourselves to upholding and protecting humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality and ensuring that humanitarian actors have safe and unimpeded access to vulnerable populations
• Accelerating humanitarian response by ensuring that emergency funding is available immediately, building on the Central Emergency Revolving Fund, and, accordingly, by inviting Member States to contribute to the restructured Fund
• Supporting the Secretary-General's efforts to strengthen inter-agency and country-level responses to the needs of internally displaced persons
• Putting in place standby arrangements for personnel and equipment to ensure the capacity to respond immediately to major disasters and other emergencies
• Strengthening Headquarters and field coordination structures and the leadership role of the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and promoting monitoring response and accountability
International environmental governance
• Strengthening environmental standard-setting, scientific discussion and monitoring and treaty compliance by building on existing institutions, as well as the treaty bodies and specialized agencies
• Integrating environmental activities at the operational level in the broader sustainable development framework
• Recognizing the need for a more coherent institutional framework of international environmental governance, with better coordination and monitoring, and considering the possibility of a more integrated structure as proposed by the Secretary-General, in particular for environmental standard-setting, scientific discussion and monitoring, that is built on existing institutions
Regional organizations
We support a stronger relationship between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations pursuant to Chapter VIII of the Charter, and therefore resolve to:
• Expand consultation and cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations through formalized agreements between the respective secretariats, the regularized involvement of regional organizations in the work of the Security Council and the participation of relevant regional organizations in the Peacebuilding Commission
• Ensure that regional organizations that have a capacity for conflict prevention or peacekeeping consider the option of placing such capacities in the framework of the United Nations Standby Arrangements System
• Request the General Assembly, on an exceptional basis, to finance regional operations authorized by the Security Council with assessed contributions
Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union
Recognizing the important role played by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in international affairs, we call for closer cooperation between the United Nations and national parliaments through their world organization with a view to furthering the Millennium Development Goals and ensuring the effective implementation of United Nations reform.
Participation of non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector
We welcome the positive contribution of non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector in the promotion and implementation of development, security and human rights programmes, and stress the importance of their continued engagement with Governments, the United Nations and other international organizations in these key areas.
Charter of the United Nations
Considering that the Trusteeship Council no longer meets and that its remaining functions are carried out by other bodies of the United Nations, in particular the General Assembly, we agree to delete Chapter XIII of the Charter and references to the Council in Chapter XII.
We agree to eliminate references to “enemy States” in Articles 53, 77 and 107 of the Charter.
We request the Security Council to consider the composition, mandate and working methods of the Military Staff Committee and to submit a recommendation for further action to the General Assembly.
