El Salvador
[Original: Spanish] [15 August 2005]
El Salvador has supported and will continue to support all initiatives to promote the creation and maintenance of zones of peace and cooperation, free of nuclear weapons.
The Government of El Salvador is aware that constant dialogue among the world's various zones of peace contributes to the achievement of specific shared objectives such as total disarmament, eradication of illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, preservation of the seas and oceans, and combating drug trafficking and all forms of transnational organized crime.
