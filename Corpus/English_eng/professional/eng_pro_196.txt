Mexico City, 17 January 2005
The Group of Friends held its fifth meeting in Mexico City to continue its endeavours in promoting the reform of the United Nations and to examine its future activities in the light of the report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change.
The Group exchanged views on the various topics of the report of the High-level Panel.
It expressed its appreciation to the members of the Panel and recognized the solid basis that the report provides to the discussions on the reform of the United Nations that will be held in the following months.
The Group also considered proposals of reform made by individual members and shared the view that revitalizing the United Nations and enhancing its capabilities require reforms in the operation of its bodies, funds and programmes.
Ways and means to improve coordination within the United Nations system were also addressed by the Group.
The Group is aware of the publication of another report that will complement the work of the High-level Panel and bring new ideas to the discussions, namely, the Sachs report (Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals).
The Group looks forward to the report of the Secretary-General in March and his proposals for a comprehensive approach to security and development, and the link between the two, and notes the Secretary-General's critical role in generating political support for strong outcomes on United Nations reform.
The Group reaffirmed its commitment to a more effective multilateralism and to the United Nations as the core multilateral organization for promoting collective security and international cooperation.
The United Nations deserves our full support and the Group recognized the invaluable role that it performs and should continue to perform.
The Group stressed that collective security is a comprehensive concept involving all threats to mankind and expressed its support to the multidimensional approach contained in the report.
It underlined that the United Nations must be ready and able to face all threats to collective security.
After exchanging views on the role that the Group of Friends can play to promote the reform of the United Nations, the Group identified several actions that can be achieved and concluded that the following approaches and actions constitute a common position of its members:
• 2005 is a crucial year to achieve tangible results for the benefit of the United Nations as a whole.
The Group is committed to mobilizing political action in favour of a comprehensive reform of the United Nations.
• The reform should correspond to today's challenges in order to address them in a legitimate and effective way.
• Enhancing the preventive capabilities of the Organization is central to any system aimed at avoiding the emergence of situations that may put international peace and security at risk.
• Economic and social development, as outlined in the Millennium Development Goals, the Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development, the Johannesburg Declaration and the Doha Declaration, and international cooperation are key elements of a preventive approach to collective security.
• In order to build towards a comprehensive reform the Group will focus first on those proposals and recommendations that enjoy wide support and do not require amendments to the Charter of the United Nations.
• The Group of Friends, individually and collectively, will share its views and proposals with all Member States at all levels in order to build a common approach towards the reform of the United Nations.
It will also coordinate its efforts with the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly.
• Members of the Group will promote the Group's views and proposals within their regions, including through regional organizations, to promote the strongest support towards an action-oriented High-level Meeting of Heads of State and Government to be held in September 2005, as decided by the General Assembly in resolution 59/145.
• Legislative bodies and civil society should be involved in the process leading to a successful High-level Meeting of Heads of State and Government.
Members of the Group decided to meet as frequently as necessary and expressed their willingness to submit to the wider membership of the United Nations, through the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly, a number of proposals based on their discussions.
The Group agreed to develop simultaneously those proposals on the basis of an initial list of issues, including the following: prevention of conflicts and the peaceful settlement of disputes, the struggle against terrorism, the fight against poverty, economic and social development and the follow-up to the Monterrey Consensus, health and infectious diseases, environmental degradation, responsibility to protect, the establishment of a peacebuilding commission, the reform of the Commission on Human Rights, institutional reform of the main United Nations organs, particularly the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Secretariat, as well as the relationship between regional organizations and the United Nations.
The Group expressed its appreciation to the Government of Mexico for its hospitality.
