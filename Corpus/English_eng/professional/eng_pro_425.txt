Sixtieth session
* A/60/50 and Corr.1.
Item 114 (c) of the preliminary list*
Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments
Confirmation of the appointment of members of the Investments Committee
Note by the Secretary-General
Article 20 of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund provides as follows:
“Article 20 “Investments Committee
“The Investments Committee shall consist of nine members appointed by the Secretary-General after consultation with the [United Nations Joint Staff Pension] Board and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.”
The present membership of the Committee is the following:
Ms. Francine J. Bovich (United States of America)*
Mr. Fernando G.
Chico Pardo (Mexico)**
Mr. William J. McDonough (United States of America)***
Mr. Khaya Ngqula (South Africa)**
Mr. Takeshi Ohta (Japan)*
Mr. J. Y. Pillay (Singapore)**
Ms. Helene Ploix (France)***
Mr. Jürgen Reimnitz (Germany)***
Mr. Peter Stormonth-Darling (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland)*
* Term of office expires on 31 December 2005.
** Term of office expires on 31 December 2006.
*** Term of office expires on 31 December 2007.
Since the terms of office of Ms. Bovich, Mr. Ohta and Mr. Stormonth-Darling will expire on 31 December 2005, it will be necessary for the General Assembly at its sixtieth session to confirm the appointment by the Secretary-General of three persons to fill these vacancies.
The persons so confirmed will serve for a period of three years, beginning on 1 January 2006.
At previous sessions, the Fifth Committee submitted to the General Assembly a draft decision containing the names of the persons recommended for confirmation.
It is suggested that a similar procedure be followed at the sixtieth session.
