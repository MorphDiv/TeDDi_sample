Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 24
Prevention of armed conflict
Letter dated 24 March 2005 from the representatives of Burkina Faso, Chad, the Gambia, Malawi, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Solomon Islands, Swaziland and Tuvalu to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly
Upon instructions from our respective Governments, we have the honour to request, pursuant to Article 35 of the Charter of the United Nations, your attention to the recent escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait, which was triggered by the passage, on 14 March 2005, of the so-called “anti-secession law” by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.
We would like to stress that the enactment of the so-called “anti-secession law” threatens the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, and further endangers peace and stability in the East Asia region.
This piece of legislation has been widely viewed as the legal excuse for the use of force against Taiwan.
Any threat of the use of force is in flagrant violation of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and goes against the spirit of the Secretary-General's report to the General Assembly entitled: “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all”.
We share the vision of collective security elaborated in the report of the Secretary-General, “In our globalized world, the threats we face are interconnected and that whatever threatens one threatens all.”
To safeguard peace, Member States must all address threats preventively.
These circumstances apply to the recent escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait.
We therefore strongly urge the United Nations to facilitate the necessary dialogue between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China in the hope of solving the dispute peacefully and avoiding any negative consequences.
It would be highly appreciated if the present letter could be circulated as a document of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly under agenda item 24.
