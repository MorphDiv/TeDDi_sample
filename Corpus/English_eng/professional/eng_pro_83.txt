Appointment of members of the Joint Inspection Unit

Addendum
Articles 2 to 4 of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, which is contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 31/192, provide as follows:
“Article 2
“1.
The Unit shall consist of not more than eleven Inspectors, chosen from among members of national supervision or inspection bodies, or from among persons of a similar competence on the basis of their special experience in national or international administrative and financial matters, including management questions.
The Inspectors shall serve in their personal capacity.
“2.
No two Inspectors shall be nationals of the same State.
“Article 3
“1.
Starting from the thirty-second session of the General Assembly, in 1977, the President of the General Assembly shall consult with Member States to draw up, with due regard to the principle of equitable geographical distribution and of reasonable rotation, a list of countries which would be requested to propose candidates who meet the qualifications mentioned in article 2, paragraph 1, above.
“2.
The President of the General Assembly, through appropriate consultations, including consultations with the President of the Economic and Social Council and with the [Chairman of the High-Level Committee on Management of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination], shall review the qualifications of the proposed candidates.
After further consultations, if necessary, with the States concerned, the President of the General Assembly shall submit the list of candidates to the Assembly for appointment.
“
“Article 4
“
“2.
An Inspector appointed to replace one whose term of office has not expired shall hold office for the remainder of that term, provided it is not less than three years.
Otherwise the duration of the appointment shall be for a full term.
“3.
An Inspector may resign on giving six months' notice to the Chairman of the Unit.
“
“5.
The Chairman of the Unit shall notify the Secretary-General of any vacancy for the necessary administrative action.
Such notification shall make the post vacant.”
On 25 June 2004, Inspector Christopher Thomas (Trinidad and Tobago) submitted his resignation to the Chairman of the Joint Inspection Unit.
Inspector Thomas had been appointed by the General Assembly on 6 June 2003 for a five-year term of office, beginning on 1 January 2004 and expiring on 31 December 2008.
In accordance with article 4, paragraph 5, of the statute, the Chairman notified the Secretary-General of the vacancy on 25 June 2004.
It will therefore be necessary for the General Assembly, at its fifty-ninth session, to appoint one person to fill this vacancy.
In accordance with article 4, paragraph 2, of the statute, the person so appointed will serve for a period expiring on 31 December 2008.
Following the consultations described in article 3, paragraph 1, of the statute, the President of the General Assembly will determine the country that will be requested to propose candidates who meet the qualifications mentioned in article 2, paragraph 1.
After holding the consultations described in article 3, paragraph 2, of the statute, including consultations with the President of the Economic and Social Council and with the Secretary-General in his capacity as Chairman of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, the President of the General Assembly will submit the name of the candidate to the Assembly for appointment.
