Before we start with the order of business, there are still a number of points of order.
Mr President, with regret I have to inform the House of the arrest yesterday in Moscow of Vladimir Alexandrovich Gusinsky, chief executive of the Most-Media group of television, radio and newspaper outlets.
Mr Gusinsky is a leading Russian community leader, being chairman of the Russian Jewish Congress and deputy chairman of the World Jewish Congress.
This morning he is in what is known as a general purpose cell in Butyrsky prison where conditions are such that they must be left to your imagination.
Mr Gusinsky's media activities were the only ones permitted to criticise Mr Putin and his government.
His independent television is the only one that questions the behaviour of Russian troops in Chechnya.
His programme Dolls, based on Britain's Spitting Image, satirises the President, something which supposedly causes him great irritation.
His radio station Moscow Echo was selected by President Clinton a few days ago for the only substantive interview that he gave to a Russian outlet.
On 11 May Mr Gusinsky's places of work were raided by so-called tax police - men in ski masks and camouflage outfits carrying Kalashnikov rifles.
There are few Russians who do not see a connection between Gusinsky's criticisms and the heavy-handed treatment now being meted out to him.
Now we have this arrest and Mr Putin says he knows nothing about it.
This latest event leaves Russia teetering on the brink.
Either Mr Putin backs down and releases Mr Gusinsky, or we shall have to conclude that Russia's brave attempt to establish a free press has turned out a failure and their democracy an illusion.
The consequences of this will be devastating.
It will mean goodbye Council of Europe, goodbye Partnership for Peace, farewell Tacis and a warm welcome to a new arms race.
The European Parliament must do what it can to avert this catastrophe.
I ask you, Mr President, to confer with your colleagues so that the whole range of EU-Russia relations can be investigated, debated and our influence brought to bear not least on the turbulent Mr Putin, who is putting us all in danger.
Thank you.
As you can hear from the applause, the House has taken note of your comment.
- (NL) Mr President, I would like to bring up another point.
Not only yesterday, but also a few months ago, every month really, permits are granted to the presidency or other nationalities to organise receptions.
These then degenerate into all-out bingeing sessions, at which point the cameras start to roll.
I think, Mr President, that that is unworthy of Parliament.
What I would like to ask through you is that these kinds of festivity be regulated properly.
I think that we can no longer afford this kind of behaviour.
I am surprised that permission is granted for this kind of thing, because my request to set up an exhibition for the handicapped, organised by myself, was turned down last week by the same College of Quaestors.
My request was looked upon critically, whereas these kinds of party, where we are portrayed as vultures, are simply tolerated.
I would ask you to raise this matter with the College of Quaestors in order to put a stop to this, as this is beneath us all.
Madam, please be so kind as to file your concern in writing with the Quaestors, who will then take the necessary steps.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I have been studying yesterday' s Minutes and I have noted that Elmar Brok, MEP, has not mentioned that there might be grounds for his disqualification when voting on the report on digital television, although he has indicated in the register containing information on Members' secondary occupations that he is senior vice-president in a company called 'Media Developments Bertelsmann' .
In my opinion, this matter should be discussed in Parliament.
I have not quite understood the honourable member.
Are you saying that he did or did not vote?
According to the translation, he did not vote and if he did not vote on a matter which is pertinent, then he behaved correctly.
Mr President, I have been reading the Minutes and it does not say here that he would not have voted.
We shall clarify the matter.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Mr President, I have taken the floor simply to tell you that I have been in contact with Mr Murphy, the rapporteur of this report, and we have agreed that it would be better to proceed to the vote without debating the report.
What you have suggested is most unusual, because normally this is decided when the order of business is adopted.
If reports have been entered on the order of business with a debate then, having consulted the Rules of Procedure, I see no way of removing them from the order of business.
I suggest that we keep to the chosen procedure with debate.
I now have another statement to make.
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to ...
(Interruption by Mr Brok)
Mr Brok, we have moved on to another point.
If it is about what the honourable member said earlier, I shall gladly give you the floor afterwards so that you can make a personal statement.
Now if you would be so kind as to take your seat, that would ease the tension somewhat.
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to table the motion by 185 members to set up a temporary committee of inquiry into ECHELON in accordance with Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure, which was rejected by a majority at the Conference of Presidents' meeting on 13 April, for a resolution by Parliament.
The President has informed me that the Conference of Presidents is due to discuss the question of setting up a temporary committee again tomorrow.
I am sure the honourable member agrees that it makes sense to wait for the results of this discussion before tabling the matter before plenary.
It makes no material difference, a vote will he held anyway, the question is merely whether it will be during this plenary session or the next.
Mr President, I do not know if the problem lies in the wording, but this does not appear to answer the question I was asking.
In fact, on tomorrow' s agenda, the Conference of Presidents has tabled its proposal for the establishment of a temporary committee, not a committee of inquiry.
This, however, is not the issue: what I am asking for is a vote on the decision by the Conference of Presidents, with the motion that there should not be a committee of inquiry.
There is another motion, but that is not it.
You have therefore not answered my question.
I believe I have because, as far as the procedure is concerned, we have two options.
First, we can vote separately on the question of setting up a temporary committee and the question of setting up a committee of inquiry.
We can do that separately and at different times.
But the Rules of Procedure do not require us to proceed in this way.
The motion, therefore, is to vote on both questions jointly as a package and that is our second option.
I cannot see that it will prejudice the idea of a committee of inquiry, which is what you want, if we merge the votes and the whole issue takes another three weeks.
It makes no material difference; at some point the House will have to state its view.
I repeat: it would be possible, but the President suggests that we proceed differently and I suggest likewise to you now.
Mr President, I think that it is quite reasonable to propose two votes at the same time, but I insist that there should be two votes: firstly, a vote on the principle of establishing a committee of inquiry, which was rejected by the Conference of Presidents, and there may have to be a second vote if agreement is reached on establishing a temporary committee, which, I must point out, serves a quite different purpose.
These are two different problems and a close look at the Rules of Procedure will show that Rule 151 does not provide for a temporary committee: it only mentions a committee of inquiry.
I feel that the plenary is within its rights to state its opinion on the position adopted by the Conference of Presidents.
Mr Lannoye, that goes without saying!
The Rules of Procedure are crystal clear: if the requisite number of signatures is collected, then a vote must be held in plenary following the decision of the Conference of Presidents, otherwise it would mean that the Conference of Presidents decides whether or not to set up a committee of inquiry rather than plenary.
And, of course, that is not how it works.
There may be one or two people in the Conference of Presidents who believe that it is, but they are labouring under a misapprehension!
(Heckling, interjection by Mr Poettering)) Mr Poettering says no-one believes that and so your problem is solved!
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to support the request and I am satisfied with your response.
At last, tomorrow afternoon, the Conference will give a response to this request which has been signed by so many Members.
I have taken note of the honourable member' s comment.
Decision on urgent procedure
The next item is the vote on the motion for urgent procedure with regard to the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(1999) 576 - C5-0280/1999 - 1999/0236(CNS)] amending Regulation (EEC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops to include flax and hemp grown for fibre and the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(1999) 576 - C5-0281/1999 - 1999/0237(CNS)] on the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp grown for fibre.
These proposals were addressed in Mrs Schierhuber' s report, on which the final vote on 16 May was postponed in accordance with Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The matter was referred back to committee.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, as the committee responsible.
.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as Parliament and the Commission are concerned, this regulation raises three issues: first, how to prevent abuse of the aid scheme for flax and hemp, because there have been very significant irregularities under the regulation in the past; secondly, how to ensure that flax and hemp, both of which are impressive, renewable raw materials with a strong ecological and social impact, can continue to be cultivated in the EU.
And thirdly, we need to protect, consolidate and promote the burgeoning processing industry in this area, an industry producing smart, ecologically valuable, biological degradable products.
So we agree on the objectives, but we do not agree on how to achieve them, which is why Parliament has postponed the final vote on this report and is currently negotiating with the Commission.
Considerable progress has been made towards consensus and a compromise has been reached on numerous points.
We met again yesterday but did not finish editing the compromises and proposed compromises.
This motion for urgency tabled by the Council or the presidency is therefore premature and we propose therefore that it be rejected for the time being.
We assume that we will have reached a compromise which can be tabled by July and plenary will then be able to vote on it in July.
I should like to reiterate my express thanks in this connection to the Commission and Commissioner Fischler, who has been most cooperative in this matter.
I hope that we shall also be able to take account in this proposal of the fact that the Commission is keen for us to table and complete this procedure this year.
Thank you.
The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture has tabled a procedural motion.
According to the Rules of Procedure, one member may speak for and one member may speak against the motion.
Mrs Schierhuber has asked to speak.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I agree wholeheartedly with the motion tabled by the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture.
He has outlined the matter quite clearly.
I, for my part as rapporteur, should like expressly to thank the Commission for its willingness to negotiate.
As you know, we still have no co-decision in agriculture, hence the two informal meetings, both of which lasted over an hour.
We reached a consensus on a great many points and the Commission too was willing to compromise.
Unfortunately, we have no written documents on which we can really vote and pass resolutions, which is why I support the motion to reject urgency for the time being.
As no one wishes to speak against the motion, we shall pass to the vote.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure.)
President.
Before we start on the order of business, Mr Brok has the floor for a personal statement.
Mr President, allow me a brief personal comment.
My professional activities are entered in the presidents' register in accordance with the rules of the European Parliament and I have conducted myself over the last eight years on that basis.
I have never taken any parliamentary action on matters which bear directly on my corporate interests and have refrained from voting on such matters, despite the fact that I am not obliged to do so.
For the rest, there has been no occasion on which my voting conduct might be interpreted as representing indirect interests or on which I have departed from the opinion of my group.
I therefore refute what Mr Seppänen has said.
President.
Mr Korakas on a point of order.
Mr President, we shall shortly be debating Mrs Lalumière' s motion for a resolution on European security and defence.
It is an important proposal and we each have an opinion on it; however, I think that, if we are to hold a proper debate on this important issue, we should have received the amendments in time.
We requested the amendments this morning between 8 and 8.30 and they were not available.
This means that, when the time comes to vote on these amendments, we shall be unable to debate them first.
Because this also happens with other debates, I should like to ask for measures to be taken so that we receive amendments in time, before reports are debated in plenary.
Our services tell me that the honourable member is right and that there was a delay in distributing the documents because the deadline was set so late.
But as we are not due to vote until Thursday, I think that there is some justification for holding the debate nonetheless.
But basically you are right and we shall make an effort to distribute the documents earlier in future.
European political parties
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:
(B5-0488/00) by Mr Poettering on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Barón Crespo on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Cox on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party and Mr Lannoye on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to the Commission on European political parties;
(B5-0494/00) by Mr Pasqua on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group to the Commission on political parties at European level.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to submit seven considerations on this important issue.
First: in 1991, the European heads of state and government expressly recognised the importance of European political parties in Article 138a of the Treaty of Amsterdam, guided by the idea that full-blown democracy in the European Union cannot be achieved without solidly-funded European political parties set on a reliable legal basis.
Secondly: next year will mark the tenth year without any material progress with the legal status of European political parties or life breathed into the Treaty.
The group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats deeply regrets this.
Thirdly: we would remind the House of the important preliminary work carried out in the Tsatsos report adopted in 1996 and the Kuhne report of 13 April 2000.
Other reports by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the most recent being the Ferber report, have also indicated the urgent need for a European party statute and for this matter to be regulated.
Fourthly: we therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is prepared to advocate an addendum to Article 191 of the EC Treaty on European political parties and thank President Prodi, Commissioner Barnier and the College as a whole for treating this concern with the importance which it deserves.
It is this which will enable a solution to be found.
We hope that the wording selected will allow the Commission to finalise a European party statute quickly, not set the majority requirements in the Council too high and respect full co-decision for the European Parliament.
Fifthly: we also welcome the fact that the European Commission obviously also confirms the possibility, if my information is correct, of proceeding on the basis of Article 308.
The possibilities offered by Article 308 must be used if and insofar as the Treaty is not supplemented.
Nonetheless, we take the firm view that supplementing the Treaty is the best way forward.
Sixthly: the chairmen of the four largest groups in the European Parliament, i.e. the group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance submitted a proposal for the core elements of a European party statute several months ago, in agreement with the chairmen of the party federations and the Commission, thereby demonstrating that this problem should and could be solved within a broad political consensus.
We are confident that other groups which do not yet have their own European party can be included in this consensus.
Seventh and lastly: we are also aware that, until such time as a European party statute enters into force, we need transitional rules regulating and limiting support for European political parties by groups in the European Parliament and we are prepared to take a broad initiative here which crosses the group divide.
We want to promote the emancipation of European political parties from the groups still further and open up future prospects for them and our main concern is to see European political parties become a major vehicle for European political work.
We want to give them this opportunity and we want, above all, to ensure that, in all aspects of support for European political parties, we have a transparent situation and clear legal conditions which can be presented as such to the public.
This will serve the credibility not only of the parties but also of the European Union and the European Parliament.
Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with the words of chairman Poettering on this joint initiative and, if you will allow me, I would like first of all to remind you that ten years ago we achieved jointly - on that occasion we were the Christian Democratic Party, the Liberals and the Socialists - the inclusion in the Treaty of Maastricht of the article recognising the personality of the political parties.
It fell to me at that time to negotiate its inclusion with President of the Council Lubbers and I would like to pay tribute to him because I believe that it was an important step.
We could have chosen to pose the question in reverse, that is to say, why, when the Commission had the monopoly on initiative for ten years, did it not take any step to regulate such an important issue?
However, we are taking a constructive view.
We want to resolve this problem which is not just a question of a legal vacuum but a constitutional problem for the European Union.
The current situation is becoming increasingly complicated.
It was traditionally believed in the media that it was necessary to go 'lobbying' in Brussels, to behave like a pressure group.
We managed to have the political parties recognised.
In our countries they are a fundamental pillar of democracy.
Nevertheless, in ten years, no progress has been made and we truly find ourselves in an increasingly difficult situation.
We could go so far as to say that at least 75% of the Members of this House are affiliated to organisations which are not clandestine, certainly, but do not have legal status, and demands are continually being made of us, which we try to respect and comply with, by the Court of Auditors, a key institution within the European Union, but which must not be the institution which in reality establishes the legal framework.
We believe that it is absolutely essential, in order to ensure that it is the democracy of the people and not the power of money, which prevails in the Union, that the Commission should exercise its power of initiative responsibly at the moment.
We have made certain useful suggestions so that we may find our way out of a situation which is not only unsatisfactory but also negative for the development of democracy in Europe.
Mr President, the essentials have been covered, but I should like to reiterate the point that the right to propose legislation rests with the Commission.
We have taken an initiative across the various political groups, which we presented in February to President Prodi.
As a matter of law there has been a reference to political parties in the Treaty for more than seven years now.
It states that the parties are a factor for integration, they contribute to the formation of European awareness and are a vital element in the democratic life of the Union and the political debate of the Union.
However, like several of the rather aspirational articles in the Treaties, Article 191, the article referred to, lacks a certain operational content.
The question is: can the Commission take an initiative which breathes life and operational content into the aspirations of Article 191?
That really is what the debate is about in this House today.
I share the concern of other speakers that the reports of the Court of Auditors - which, by the way, we fully anticipated in this House several years ago with the report of Professor Tsatsos, which pointed out the urgent necessity of validating parties in statutory terms - adds a new urgency.
The institutions must be able to deliver accountability and transparency.
This House does not have the right to draft legislation: that is the exclusive preserve of the Commission.
We are asking for your assistance to ensure that this vital element, as the Treaty states, in the democratic life and political debate of the Union is validated by statute.
Mr President, my Group has also been involved in submitting this motion to the Commission, simply on the basis that we are creating a Europe that is undergoing integration, but it is not at all clear that our citizens will be able to have a say in this merging Europe and keep pace with the advance of integration.
I do not want to say that the political parties are the only, or even necessarily, the most important channel whereby the public can have a say in matters that currently affect society, but they play a part, and the status of the European parties must be defined without delay.
Just as my colleagues have said, these parties must be brought out into the light of day.
They are, in any case, already active today.
They cannot replace the national parties, but cooperation among national parties is no longer necessarily enough.
It is important that we agree on fully open and transparent financing when the European parties are defined.
It is, for example, very important that accurate information is available concerning their sources of income, and the financing of elections is of particular importance in this respect, since money must not determine success in elections.
My Group does not merely intend that we should acquire in this way a funding channel for the European parties, but what is most important is that there will now be the opportunity to define those basic principles on which the European parties can function.
We must take the view that they must respect fundamental democratic rights, human rights and the principle of the rule of law when they function.
The time perhaps has come to specify that only European parties such as these may enjoy public support.
If the legal basis is vague, we agree with the request for the Commission to take an initiative to make it clearer, and the Intergovernmental Conference must also take responsibility for this.
Mr President, according to the Treaty, parties which contribute to informing the citizens about events which take place within the Union and the European Parliament are political parties, and therefore, by their political activities, they contribute to the development of a European awareness and European knowledge.
But what is European awareness?
It may be that the Treaties are not sufficiently clear on this subject, seeing that they do not mention the rights of the disabled and they do not provide enough protection for children and babies, who are nowadays particularly affected by widespread paedophilia in Europe.
European consciousness is that which must contribute to the development of mutual respect, which must prevent one culture prevailing over another, and which must ensure that tolerance is not confused with laxity and an absence of rules and laws and that laws and rules are not made with the intention of protecting some and not others.
The European culture is born of respect for our national cultures and national traditions.
New elements are integrated, but this must not lead to a situation where one category of individuals dominates to the detriment of another.
The citizens of the Union need greater protection of their rights, economic and otherwise, in the face of a world market which is becoming increasingly dominated by the interests of multinationals and of a world market created, one might say, to serve political as well as other purposes.
Therefore, European parties are not those parties which, to further party interest, have the same acronym in different countries, but those parties whose common ideals, values and programmes lead them to unite within groups and to work together to give the citizens a louder voice and greater representativity
So, à la Voltaire, if you want to talk to me, lay down the rules now.
We have to clarify whether the European parties are something that we want to develop now, something different which will overlap with the national parties, that is if we desire cultural and political globalisation to follow economic globalisation - which would bring total uniformity - or whether we want, effectively, to build a Europe in which parties with the same affinities and ideals can work together at European level.
European parties, let us not kid ourselves!
Before hearing the speakers for the groups, I would like to give the floor to Commissioner Barnier.
.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall answer this series of questions, which all, or more or less all, seek to question or probe the European Commission.
At the instigation of the chairmen of your Parliament' s main political groups, Mr Poettering, Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Cox, Mrs Hautala and Mr Lannoye, you asked the Commission to state its position on a very important and topical issue: the status of political parties in Europe.
We therefore decided to look into this issue and I am now able to inform you of the European Commission' s position, as it considered the matter yesterday at its weekly meeting.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the many studies that Parliament has undertaken on this issue over the last ten years, as many of you have mentioned, such as the reports by Professor Tsatsos and Mr Ferber and, more recently, on 13 April, the report by your fellow Members, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen.
We are aware of Parliament' s concern and we are familiar with your proposals.
We share your desire for changes to consolidate European democracy and the extremely important process of European integration.
Mr Poettering reminded us of the Treaty' s current wording.
I would like to talk about the former Article 138 A, which has now become Article 191, and which states that "political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union.
They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union" .
This text, Mrs Hautala, which, it is true, is merely declaratory, but which does have the virtue of existing, demonstrates that European political parties will under no circumstances come to replace national parties.
This must be stated and restated.
This is no more likely to happen than European citizenship, which is also provided for in the texts, ever replacing national citizenship.
The one will complement the other, and that is the issue before us here today.
Nevertheless, as I have just said, as important as this text is, it is merely declaratory.
It does not include any operational measures, which are clearly lacking and clearly necessary, particularly in order to answer, as Mr Barón Crespo mentioned, the requests and questions addressed to the Court of Auditors.
I shall therefore answer you by stating the European Commission' s intentions, whilst stressing the twofold concern, the twofold demand that we must address, or rather that we must all address together.
Firstly, the requirement for speed: things have perhaps dragged on for too long over a period of ten years, without any solution being found.
This speed must, however, be accompanied by another requirement, which is legal safety and stability.
In the face of this twofold requirement, there are two options that must be considered.
The first, which was recommended in the Ferber report, would be to draw up a legislative proposal on the basis of the current Treaty.
In this framework, Article 308 could be an operational measure, at least in a provisional phase, linking it to Article 191, in content.
But, and I am not saying 'but' in a restrictive way, it is simply an expression of the concern for legal security that I mentioned, you know as well as we do that the use of Article 308 is cause for quite widespread reservation and that, in any event, it requires unanimous agreement following consultation of the European Parliament.
It is our opinion that the status of European political parties needs to have an unassailable legal basis.
The second option is recommended in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report and is also favoured by the President of the Commission, Mrs Schreyer, and the leaders of the five main European parties, as they stated in a letter that we received yesterday and I myself favour it.
This would be, within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference, to provide an amendment to Article 191 that would probably provide greater legal security.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, having said all of this, I should like to confirm, in order to provide a specific answer to your question, that the Commission is ready to take action.
It will face up to its responsibilities and will therefore come up with an initiative.
We shall do so immediately by taking the opportunity provided by the next trialogue to undertake a study and to find the best way to effectively bring the three institutions together on this issue.
We shall do so in light of the discussion which will take place in July, by working on and using the optimum legal combination of articles 308 and 191.
In any event, we hope to achieve this in the short term by proposing, in forthcoming weeks and months, in the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference, the text for a proposal for an amendment to Article 191 which will complement this article, make it operational and more precise, and which will therefore provide a clear, sound, transparent and definitive legal basis for the organisation of political parties at European level.
At this stage, since I have just been speaking about the Intergovernmental Conference, I feel sure that your representatives in these negotiations, your President, Mrs Fontaine, and the two other representatives who are taking an extremely active role, Mr Brok, who is present, and Professor Tsatsos, will be able to justify, relay and explain the need for this new legal basis by means of an amendment to Article 191 as proposed by the Commission.
I am grateful to you all for having brought this issue to the attention of the Commission and European public opinion.
I am not surprised by the fact that it is Parliament that did so, firstly because there has been - as many of you have pointed out - a long wait and several requests in the past, but also because it is this Chamber that is the democratic forum for political debate in Europe.
This is the right place to call for stronger foundations for this debate on behalf of the people of Europe, through and by means of the European political parties.
The Commission has therefore responded very favourably to this request.
In the next few days, it will shoulder its responsibilities and will, in the spirit that I have just mentioned, launch a three-stage initiative, with the reservation that I mentioned right at the beginning of my speech, which is the coordination that there must be between us, with all the institutions.
You should not be surprised at this favourable response by the European Commission.
The germ of the idea was already present in the Commission opinion of 26 January, which I delivered to you, with President Prodi, on the subject of the European Commission' s proposals for reforming the institutions, as, in the text of 26 January we proposed, as you yourselves did, to draw up European lists for the European elections.
We also stated in that text that this opportunity for a certain proportion of European MPs to be elected from European lists would make the organisation of European parties and their role easier.
I think that the time has come to consolidate this guideline, to make it more precise and to provide it with a clear legal basis.
That is why, in the next few days, the Commission will be adopting the initiative that you have been requesting, first through the trialogue and then by looking at how the optimum combination of Articles 308 and 191 can be achieved within the framework of the IGC.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my Group chairman has tipped me the wink and I am able to say on behalf of our group, the PPE-DE, that we fully support and welcome the Commission' s explanations in reply to the oral question, as regards both what was said and the timetable and legal evaluation.
Secondly: I am also delighted that we are again stepping up the political debate on the party statute, the pressure of time in the run up to the final stage of the intergovernmental conference notwithstanding.
This is not just a question of money.
This is also a question of political self-awareness, a question of political identity, a question of the role of national and European parties in the unification process.
We want a stronger European Parliament and that means reducing unanimity and increasing the co-decision powers of the European Parliament.
But a stronger European Parliament depends on strong groups in Parliament which have the authority to act.
We want a strong Commission which drives the European integration process forward.
One of the ways in which this is expressed is by lobbying for the President' s function to be strengthened and through parliament' s proposals to the intergovernmental conference.
We want a statute for European political parties because our democracy is a civil and party-political parliamentary democracy.
But we must not underestimate the psychological importance of this debate.
At present people and national parties are elected.
We want, as we have stated in the proposal to the intergovernmental conference, members on European lists to be elected because we want to raise the European political profile of members further still.
The proposal was touched on at the intergovernmental conference.
I readily admit that we want European lists and European members of parliament.
The proposals have been made; it all depends on the European party statute.
The report by the Court of Auditors containing demands on the groups was also touched on.
We shall comply with these demands.
My group started taking steps in this direction even before the Court of Auditors' report in order to clarify this transparency and this division.
But it cannot work against the European parties because that would represent a reduction in our European self-awareness.
That is also why the party statute is one of the conditions which needs to be put in place so that we can in fact quickly do what is demanded of us and what we demand of ourselves.
Mr President, I take good note of Commissioner Barnier' s statement and the commitment which the Commission is making.
Please allow me to express, not a criticism, but surprise in relation to the unassailable legal basis.
The Union Treaty, at that time signed by the twelve Heads of State and Government and ratified by all the parliaments of the Member States with the approval of the European Parliament, which recognises citizenship, is not, it appears, a sufficient legal basis.
This surprises me because to be associated with a political party is a fundamental right for citizens and, while our citizenship is recognised, that right is not.
We did not manage to have this included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The Commission is behaving gingerly and takes this approach: two stages, almost three stages, according to the Commissioner.
I understand that the proposal relating to the tripartite dialogue and stemming from Article 308 is a provisional proposed legislative provision and the best laws, at least in my country, are provisional laws, which are the ones which have lasted the longest.
This would allow us to end this current situation of a lack of legal status, and I take good note of this and I believe we should work in that direction.
The second step is the amendment of the Treaties.
I believe I can say that we all support it, but the important thing at the moment is, firstly, the existence of a public commitment by the Commission to exercise its right to initiative, a common will to consolidate a fundamental dimension for European citizenship and contribute immediately to the political parties beginning not only to exist in reality, but also to be legally recognised, because I believe that this is an important step towards the construction of European democracy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I naturally concur with Mrs Hautala' s views on transparency.
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his proposal in which we will be given the opportunity to exchange ideas here with Parliament which is, after all, eminently suited to express its opinion on this matter.
But what we need is an initiative - albeit hopelessly overdue - from the Commission.
After all, for the past twenty years, we at the European Free Alliance have been bringing together political parties which want to help build Europe on the basis of a diversity of cultures, peoples and regions.
In this connection, we have always attempted to stand up for the small and the weak, who cannot represent themselves in this big Parliament but whose concerns we are trying to take into consideration.
Up to now, it has been impossible to do this fully transparently, because there has been no clarity with regard to the European parties' expenditure and revenue, among other things.
But there are questions left unanswered concerning the future too.
It has not yet been mentioned here, Commissioner, but I would like to raise the question nevertheless.
Will the European democratic parties which in future appoint themselves as European parties only be supported if they stand for the values on which Europe is built?
This seems a rhetorical question to me.
I hope that the Commission can give me a clear answer to it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are totally opposing views on European political parties within my group.
The main question raised is the extent to which they can actually represent a European public.
Direct links with people exist not at a pan-European, but at national or regional level.
That is where the parties are anchored, that is where their members and electorate are.
The situation is in fact quite paradoxical.
First, there are European parties.
Secondly, there is Article 191, which states that European political parties are an important factor for integration.
Thirdly, at the same time, we still have no idea what European political parties actually are.
On 12 December last year, the chairmen of the Party of European Socialists, the European People' s Party, the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the European Free Alliance and the secretary-general of the European Federation of Green Parties themselves stated in a joint declaration that clarification was needed as to what a European party is.
Now I am convinced that, outside this House, no-one, to all intents and purposes, can comprehend or understand this.
Plus, the parties tend to take themselves very seriously.
It is not by chance that citizens - and not just in my country - are highly sceptical about things such as party memberships.
When they commit, it is mainly in civil initiatives, non-governmental organisations and various structures within the civil society.
I have nothing against European parties.
I think that they face the challenge of achieving cross-border coordination of their work during the course of integration.
But one thing is unacceptable and that is a situation in which European parties exist and receive funding but are still undefined.
The criticism of the Court of Auditors was justified.
I should like to close by saying that I too am in favour of finding a solution to this muddle.
But the solution must include treating political democratic forces in Europe equally, including those which define themselves otherwise and which, for example, are critical of the EU, and not excluding them from this problem-solving process.
Mr President, I would first of all, perhaps specifically for the benefit of the German delegates, insofar as they still care about respecting the rule of law, like to remind you of the judgement by the German Constitutional Court of Karlsruhe, in which the European Union is unambiguously defined as a confederacy, and hence the opposite of a federal state.
In fact, this vision of the European Union is also held by the large majority of citizens of our Member States for whom our Union is a close partnership of free peoples and states which very clearly respects the principle of subsidiarity.
In the light of this, the project of European political parties is the umpteenth fundamentally undemocratic project because it can only widen the enormous chasm which exists between the electorate on the one hand and European political decision-making on the other.
But this is apparently the price which some, hiding behind a mask of rhetoric, are willing to pay here in order to channel even more of the taxpayers' money to already excessive party funds.
It is also a project of people who are hoping to create the European federal superstate.
Indeed, these people are trying to attain their goal, the undemocratic federal superstate, by guile, and seize upon a variety of issues, including monetary union, the unified statute for MEPs and the possible accession of countries which are not even geographically situated in Europe, such as Turkey, to help them reach that goal.
In a European Union which really respects the principle of subsidiarity, we do not need a European political party.
Anyone who has different ideas about Europe or who would like to increase the pompe afrique, the money pump from the taxpayer to the European political parties, should have the courage to stand up and speak out, but you are lacking this courage.
Mr President, I am a strong supporter of cooperation between peoples.
Many problems can only be solved jointly.
Global problems must be solved in the UN.
The court here in Strasbourg can support us in connection with human rights.
In Brussels, we have close economic cooperation between the EU and the EEA in connection with a common market.
Would we obtain better solutions, however, if decision-making were, in every conceivable case, to be centralised in Brussels?
Would we obtain better democracy by downgrading the national parties and raising the profile of common supranational parties?
Would more people join, become active members and take part in debates in connection with elections and decision-making?
Supranational EU parties are an artificial product which will never be financed through voluntary subscriptions but only by siphoning off EU funds.
We are familiar with the pattern from many national parties which have distanced themselves from the electorate and instead allow themselves to be financed by the State, business and the unions.
It is quite right that the State should support parliamentary work and provide citizens with information.
It must not, however, be a propaganda machine for the view of the majority.
To quote Grundtvig, doyen of the public education movement in Denmark, there must be 'freedom for Loki as well as for Thor' .
The supranational EU parties will never win the hearts and minds of ordinary people.
They will instead be populated by highly paid officials bound to no country in particular - bureaucrats without roots in local political associations.
Manifestos will be written by small groups of experts out of touch with the lives of real people.
An artificial product of that kind does not deserve financial support from the EU.
My group will vote against subsidies for supranational EU parties and against bending the Treaty by using flexible clauses for that purpose.
Mr President, this is a question of democracy.
Democracy is transparency, public accessibility, rule by the people, and participation.
The current European political parties do not represent transparency or public accessibility.
It is a rhetorical question, but who of us knows anything about the European political parties?
The only certainty is that some groups in the European Parliament have given financial support to the Europarties, contrary to the regulations concerning parliamentary funds.
They have been discovered in the investigations conducted by the Court of Auditors.
I suspect these abuses are now being covered up.
The European political parties do not represent democracy.
They are parties of parties and that means that the public does not have the opportunity to participate directly in their activities.
For rule by the nation, you need a nation.
Europe is not a nation; it is nations.
We have no concept of supranational democracy.
Now, supranational rules and regulations for Europarties controlled by the big countries are being drawn up, with the Commission' s support, by the big parties in the big countries.
Parties of parties are not democracy.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Seppänen, Mr Brok and Mr Vanhecke because I think that contrary to what the Chairman of the Liberal Group has told us, the key point has not been stressed.
The key point - and there is a high degree of unanimity on this within the Chamber - is money.
It is the spoils that our friends at the back are already looking to share out amongst themselves.
It is the institution of a European system of public financing and it is not therefore the strengthening of democracy but of 'partiocracy' , which in many Member States has already caused the damage we are all familiar with.
That is my first point.
The second key point - and this has probably gone somewhat over Mrs Maes' s head - is that we would be able to create new rules for bureaucracy which would then allow us to discriminate against one party or another, not on the basis of criminal laws or an infringement of such laws, but on the basis of new, discretionary rules and therefore - because this is what you want, Mrs Maes - to make it an offence to express an opinion.
At this point, I doubt - judging by the number of mouths that are watering here - that we have the majority that is required to reject this motion, to reject this institutionalisation of bureaucracy, which is becoming more and more pervasive within Parliament.
I think that the public should be made aware of this: what is being proposed to us today is not a Europe of the citizens but a Europe of the taxpayers, whom we are once again going to bleed dry in order to allow bureaucracy to proliferate in the future.
This is a long way from what a democracy should be and, in my opinion, we must condemn this initiative.
Political parties are de facto associations and perhaps they should simply publish their budgets.
It is true that this is not done at national level, but perhaps we should begin to move in that direction so that, from now on, we know what they are doing with their money.
.
(FR) Mr President, I should like to add a few words, but not to provide individual answers to everyone who has spoken on this matter.
Indeed, the diversity of the statements that I have just heard is fine proof of both the topicality and the sensitive nature of this debate.
Whilst thanking several of you, particularly Mr Karas and Mr Barón Crespo, who have properly understood the thrust of the Commission' s position, I should like to say quite clearly to Mr Barón Crespo, so that there is no ambiguity, that we intend to study all the options and to do so immediately.
I expressed this by calling Article 308 a valuable operational procedure.
To put it simply, with regard to Article 308 with whose rationale and constraints you are familiar, we need this dialogue within the trialogue.
We need this collaboration between the three institutions.
We shall try to achieve this immediately but we are working on the combination, which I explained just now, of Article 308, which we feel is an appropriate operational basis - subject to the trialogue and the resulting opinion - and Article 191.
After this we will accept our responsibilities - and I repeat this for the second time - and we shall also accept our responsibilities within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference, at which I promise to fight for the proposal that the Commission will be producing in the next few weeks, as strenuously as you know I can.
The subject you have raised, Mrs Maes, is an extremely sensitive one, and this issue is clearly open to various interpretations.
I shall take the liberty of giving you my personal feeling on this matter at this stage.
I cannot believe that the political parties that expect to benefit from the new status recognised in the Treaties - if we do indeed achieve these changes for European political parties - are not as a matter of course committed to respecting the democratic values that are the foundations of the European Union.
I respect the opinions that many of you have expressed.
I do not think, however, that we should speak, as Mr Vanhecke did, of an "antidemocratic process" .
The political parties are united in this very place through you, in joint groups.
They consult each other.
Outside the European Parliament, joint meetings and demonstrations are held and joint statements are made.
Ultimately, we must recognise the true nature of political debate in Europe and give this debate a sounder structure and a clear and transparent legal basis.
Considering the matter from this point of view, these changes would represent progress for the general public but also, Mr Dupuis, for the taxpayers, who are generally the same people.
I should like to add or repeat that these European political parties, as they are organised today, on an unsteady foundation, and as they will be organised tomorrow, on a clear and legally sound basis, if we succeed, will not replace the national political parties, they will complement them and will give them a European dimension.
By the same token, European citizenship has never replaced and will never replace national citizenship: it complements it and gives it a European dimension.
That is what I wanted to say, Mr President - with a few personal observations, of course - on the reasoning behind the Commission' s position as I explained it just now.
This is the basis on which we shall be working in the next few days in order to achieve the best possible results as quickly as possible.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Security and defence
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:
(B5-0315/2000) by Mr Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council on the European Common Security and Defence Policy in view of the European Council meeting in Feira;
(B5-0475/00) by Mr Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Commission on the European Common Security and Defence Policy in view of the European Council meeting in Feira.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are already able to discuss this issue here today and I should like to start by saying that I consider this, to all intents and purposes, to be the first reading of the Lalumière report, because Mrs Lalumière has invested a great deal of expertise and work in this project.
We must stress that, after Amsterdam, Cologne and Helsinki, a great deal of progress has been made in developing the foreign, security and defence policy and we would like to thank the Council and the Commission for making this progress possible in these areas.
It is the result of our understanding that a disaster such as we have witnessed in the Balkans must never happen again.
We must guarantee that Europe has the authority to act in the area of foreign, security and defence policy, the authority which allows us to safeguard our interests jointly; however, at the same time, we must make it clear that this is not an alternative to the transatlantic alliance.
This development complements NATO, which will continue to remain responsible for collective security in Europe.
We as the European Parliament have already come to this conclusion by intensifying and institutionalising collaboration with the NATO parliamentary assembly.
We must realise that Amsterdam transferred the Petersberg tasks of the WEU to the European Union and that, as a result, practically all areas of the Western European Union now come under the responsibility of the European Union.
All that remains is Article 5.
I think this Intergovernmental Conference should consider whether Article 5 can be adopted in the form of a protocol to the EU Treaty and whether we should leave it to each Member State to take a sovereign decision as to whether or not it subscribes to this protocol.
This is surely a way for non-allied, neutral countries to find their own way as members of the European Union while, at the same time, allowing collaboration in practically all circumstances.
In the long run, this must be credibly sustained by the European Union.
We are a Union with our own legislation, which has resulted in our own legal system, and with our own interests based on the internal market and monetary union, which is why areas with different standards of security within the European Union must be a thing of the past.
This will surely help to develop a coherent foreign, security and defence policy.
We can see, precisely in Community matters, that the European Union has a plethora of instruments which are important for foreign and security policy, especially for civil crisis management, and that we are therefore able to provide more foreign aid than the United States Congress, that trade policy is the responsibility of the Commission and therefore that the nucleus of our potential to act is a Community remit and that we should not assign the development of a foreign, security and defence policy to intergovernmental collaboration.
The European Parliament will advocate bringing the Community position, the Community part to the fore.
We are of course delighted that we have a highly qualified High Representative in the person of Mr Solana, but it has always been the aim of the European Parliament in the long run to have a European foreign secretary incorporated into the Community area as part of the Commission.
This is unattainable at present for certain reasons, but we should strive towards it.
It is still our aim.
We can see that the Commission has a large stake and that foreign and security policy is being formulated in the European Council.
Defence is still a matter for national governments when it comes to equipment and similar questions.
This must be merged, including practically, so that such absurdities never occur again.
If we just think that today the foreign secretary of Kazakhstan will be received by fifteen foreign secretaries, the Commissioner responsible for foreign affairs and the High Representative, then I think this makes for wonderful Council meetings, but it is not a sign of any particular authority to act on the part of the European Union.
I think that we must speak up with one voice more loudly here and the Troika of Council President, High Representative and Commissioner for Foreign Affairs introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam should first establish the Union' s authority to act; we should not have any other definitions in this area.
We must also ensure that this Treaty improves our decision-making mechanisms and we should not forget the huge shortcomings brought to light in the organisational disaster in Kosovo, which are the reason for the lack of an arms export policy and which have so far forestalled unity in the EU Treaty.
We must recognise the fact that we are squandering money in national budgets.
We spend more on defence than America, but with far fewer results.
This also applies to transport, satellites and such like.
According to the Treaty, this European Parliament is responsible for parliamentary control, including and especially of the Petersberg tasks, which is why the control function of the European Parliament must also be strengthened.
We shall also endeavour to bring about cooperation as well as collaboration with the foreign and defence policy committees of national parliaments in order to close gaps and cooperate with the parliaments of candidate and other countries.
But this European Parliament is named in the Treaty as the parliamentary controller of foreign, security and defence policy to the exclusion of all others.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during Portugal' s Presidency of the European Union the development of the Common European Security and Defence Policy has been regarded as a priority, as is evident from the document which we presented at the beginning.
The report to be submitted to the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira will detail the progress made on the various mandates received in Helsinki.
In particular it will cover the development of the European military capability, the headline goal, the institutional development of the permanent political and military bodies, the relations between the European Union and third countries in this area, the relations between the European Union and NATO, an indication of whether or not the EU Treaty needs to be revised and the problem of non-military crisis management mechanisms.
In the area of foreign policy and the Common European Security and Defence Policy, the EU has decided to develop the military and non-military dimensions in parallel.
We clearly must coordinate these two dimensions and particularly the military and non-military crisis management actions which the EU may decide to undertake.
This coordination will be carried out by the new structures of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in particular by the Political and Security Committee, the future Military Committee and the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management.
I must point out that the interim bodies started work in March 2000 and that the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management was formally created during the Portuguese Presidency.
As will be evident from the Presidency' s report to the Feira European Council, an effort is being made to simultaneously develop the military and non-military crisis management capabilities.
The Member States have already been working to develop the headline goal.
For example this was discussed yesterday at a meeting of the General Affairs Council attended by the Defence Ministers.
The Feira European Council will also see the Member States make a commitment to develop their civil police capability by 2003, with up to 5 000 officers, for crisis management operations.
This represents a major effort by the Member States to ensure sustained and uniform development of these two dimensions which are fundamental for security and stability.
On another issue raised in Mr Brok' s question, I must say that strengthening the Common Foreign and Security Policy by developing a common European security and defence policy, thus allowing the EU to establish a military capability and also to reinforce the efficacy of its civilian crisis management mechanisms, does not necessarily require an increase in the defence budgets of the Member States.
Rather, the basic objective will be to improve the use and rationalisation of the military assets and capabilities of the Member States.
In this context it must be said that the European Union will use, in order to develop the headline goal, the NATO defence planning, the planning and review process for countries which are not members of NATO and the defence capabilities initiative which is ongoing within the Alliance.
Every effort is being made to ensure effective use of all the assets and capabilities and to avoid the duplication which could lead to additional defence costs.
No increase in the Community budget is planned as these efforts are to be implemented by the Member States in a context of voluntary cooperation.
A final answer on the budgetary impact of this policy may only be given, however, after the Commitment Capability Conference to be held in the autumn.
This will analyse the national military contributions to this joint effort and the shortfalls which it may be considered necessary to meet.
As for the involvement of the European Parliament in this process, it should be recalled that the Common European Security and Defence Policy is a component of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The EU intends to make its foreign dimension more effective and credible by developing military and civilian crisis management capabilities.
Under Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, Parliament shall be consulted by the Presidency on the main aspects and the basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The views of Parliament shall be taken into consideration by the Council.
The European Parliament shall also be kept regularly informed of the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and may ask the Council about aspects which it considers are important and may make recommendations which it deems appropriate.
The need to avoid unnecessary duplication and to make the best use of all the existing assets and capabilities also underlies the development of the Common European Security and Defence Policy.
It is therefore natural that the Member States have from the beginning advocated the transfer of WEU powers which could prove useful in the process now under way in the European Union.
Portugal, which holds the Presidency of the WEU, has tried to advance the process for transferring powers from the WEU to the European Union.
The Portuguese Presidency has therefore prepared a set of political and military concepts and procedures which, following the WEU Council of Ministers meeting in Oporto, will be transferred to the European Union.
This constitutes a fundamental part of the acquis which must be preserved.
During our Presidency of the WEU, preparations for the process of transferring the Institute for Security Studies and the Satellite Centre of the WEU have also been started.
This will occur during the next presidency.
The WEU has already taken the decision to allow the EU direct access to these structures.
Therefore, in accordance with the desire expressed by the Member States, the transfer of the Institute for Security Studies and the Satellite Centre will take place.
The transfer of powers from the WEU to the EU does not imply the end of the WEU; at least this is not the current aim of the Member States.
The amended Treaty of Brussels will remain in force without any further changes.
This is why the collective defence mechanism specified in Article 5 will also remain in operation for the States which have signed this Treaty, as will the Parliamentary Assembly, which will continue to operate fully.
However, the whole organisational structure will be slimmed down.
This will then simply provide support to a permanent council which will meet when necessary and to other structures which will continue to operate, in particular the Western Europe Armaments Group.
The budget for this organisation will also be substantially reduced.
The Common European Security and Defence Policy requires a close, intense and transparent relationship between the European Union and NATO.
The Portuguese Presidency has paid particular attention to developing ways of establishing this relationship, which must be based on cooperation, dialogue and transparency.
However, it must not threaten the autonomy of these two organisations.
The report to be presented to the Feira European Council includes a document establishing the principles and terms of this relationship during this interim period.
Four ad hoc working groups involving the EU and NATO will be created on the following issues: security, European military capability, development of processes for transferring NATO assets and capabilities to operations led by the European Union and, finally, definition of the permanent terms of the relationship between the European Union and NATO.
If necessary, other working groups on specific issues may be created.
In its effort to develop the European military capability, the EU must take into account the need to maintain a relationship of cooperation, dialogue and consultation with European allies who are not members of the European Union and with the applicant countries.
It must be stressed that the headline goal defined in Helsinki is open to participation by these countries which may therefore contribute to the European force.
According to the document agreed by the European Union which will form an integral part of the Feira European Council report, a single and inclusive structure will be created in which the fifteen Member States of the European Union and the fifteen third countries will participate.
This structure will be responsible for dialogue, cooperation and consultation between these countries.
In view of the fundamental role of the six European allies who are not members of the European Union and also bearing in mind that NATO may provide assets and capabilities for operations led by the EU, meetings will take place within this single structure between the Fifteen and these six countries to discuss issues involving the development of the European military capability.
In the pre-crisis phase or rather at the start of a crisis, dialogue, cooperation and consultation will clearly be reinforced and, if the EU were to consider using NATO assets and capabilities, particular attention would be given to the dialogue, cooperation and consultation with the six European allies who are not members of the EU.
It must be stressed that, under the terms agreed in Helsinki, EU operations will in principle be open to participation by these countries.
Russia, Ukraine and other European countries may also participate in operations led by the European Union.
The French Presidency will be responsible for presenting the Nice European Council with proposals on the terms for the consultation and participation of these countries.
At the Feira European Council, the European Union will record the interest expressed by Canada in participating in this joint European effort.
Finally, in Helsinki the Portuguese Presidency was given the task of presenting the Feira European Council with an indication of whether or not the Treaty of Amsterdam needs to be revised.
From the debate conducted and the opinions expressed, it has been possible to conclude that the implementation of the EU decisions on the Common European Security and Defence Policy does not require the Treaty to be revised as this policy falls legally within the provisions currently in force.
However, as this is a process that is open to developments, the Member States have agreed on the need to keep an eye on this issue.
Mr President, I welcome this timely and useful debate, which was introduced characteristically and forcefully by my honourable friend, Mr Brok, in a thoughtful and useful speech.
I welcome the report by Mrs Lalumière.
It is an exceptionally helpful document.
What it says about non-military crisis management provides us with a checklist, an action list of things we should be making sure are put in place over the next few years.
It is a very good report, and I would like to congratulate the honourable lady, without reservation, on what she has said.
The Commission has actively contributed to non-military crisis management since long before the Cologne and Helsinki Summits.
These summits have reminded us that there is an urgent need for our policies to become more ambitious, coherent and effective.
We need to improve our capacity for rapid and targeted action.
We need to step up our efforts of coordination.
We need to improve the availability of analysis and information exchange, and we need to radically enhance our capacities for pursuing preventive policies.
The creation of additional instruments, or the mobilisation of additional funding, does not, in my judgement, stand in the centre of current deliberations; nor are far-reaching Treaty changes required.
Instead, our focus lies on using existing instruments and financial resources considerably more efficiently.
Parliament knows the priority which the Commission and I attach to discharging our existing competencies a great deal more energetically and a great deal more competently than we have in the past.
That gives us a considerable agenda for the next few years.
I hope that we will have the support of Parliament in working through it.
We should build on existing competencies.
We should bring them to bear more effectively on the twin goals of conflict prevention and crisis management.
Saying 'no' to institutional revolution does not mean turning our backs on innovation.
The Commission recently tabled a proposal for the creation of a rapid reaction facility.
The limited funds we think are required for that facility will be found by redeployment within our existing budget.
I also believe that the idea to set up a European civil police corps merits careful examination through a feasibility study by the Council, as proposed in the relevant European Parliament resolution.
It is also plain that the Commission's lack of human resources for both conflict prevention and crisis management greatly impinges upon our capacity to make more rapid progress in this field, though that is something we are attempting at present to address.
Let me be clear about the Commission's role.
We are plainly not responsible for coordination of the military and civil components in crisis management.
What the Commission is trying to do is to ensure an effective and coherent Community input into the overall coordinated effort of the Union in this area.
I have spoken before about the impossibility of making a clear distinction, in preventing a crisis or in managing a crisis, between the military and the civil components.
The important thing is to recognise the relationship between the two.
Look at what the Commission is doing around the world: we are paying for the training of police in anti-terrorism tasks in Palestine.
We are helping to create border services in the Balkans.
We are spending money on de-mining in virtually every continent.
Those are the sorts of ways in which the Commission is contributing to preventative diplomacy and I hope that in future Europe will manage those tasks in a more coherent way.
This is not our first effort to create as it were a common foreign and security policy.
We had the Pleven plan.
We had de Gasperi.
We had Fouchet.
We had years of European political cooperation, during which there were lots of ringing declarations, perhaps slightly too many of them, some weeks after they could actually have any effect on events.
The decision taken at Maastricht, the decision taken at Amsterdam, the decision taken at Helsinki - they all mark a signal move forward, a recognition that we have not done enough in the past to ensure that Europe's voice is heard adequately around the world and that Europe's capacities to prevent and manage crises are brought to bear with sufficient competence and vigour.
This time we have to make a difference.
This time we have to ensure that a common foreign and security policy ensures that Europe discharges its responsibilities at the level which events require, at the level which our citizens now in my judgement demand.
We in the Commission want to play our full part in ensuring that this time a common foreign and security policy is a resounding success.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I should like to welcome, as my colleague, Elmar Brok has just done, the progress that has been made in European defence and political unity.
I would like to remind you that during the tragedy in Bosnia it was said that Europe died in Sarajevo.
It is my opinion that, in political and military terms, it had not even been born when that tragedy erupted.
Europe awoke when the crisis in Kosovo arose.
Europe spoke with one voice, as you have just said, Commissioner Patten.
It made its voice heard, it stated the limits of what was tolerable and in the end took military action, all other political, economic and diplomatic pressure having failed.
If, however, our American friends had not then joined the combat on our side, Europe would not have been able to act effectively.
It is this awareness of our dependence on the Americans - and that is not to blame the Americans in any way - which has brought about this sea change in European public opinion.
This is not to blame the Americans for having gone into Kosovo with us, because I must remind you that, until they became involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina, people said that it was because there was no oil in Bosnia, whereas there was oil in Kuwait.
Well, our American friends did join us in that war, but without them we would not have been able to perform that task as efficiently as we did.
Let us not harbour any illusions.
The determination created as a result of that crisis, shared by more than two-thirds of public opinion in the Fifteen Member States of the Union, will not achieve results straightaway.
It will take time - time and money.
It will take time because, as you all know, it takes at least ten to fifteen years to develop an arms programme.
In the meantime, it is quite clear that everything that has been done and all the decisions that have been taken, particularly in the area of our relationship with NATO, are quite satisfactory.
It will require money, and I welcome the courage of our rapporteur, Mrs Lalumière, and join her in saying that we cannot achieve any more with the money that we have spent to date.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as you can see, the European Parliament takes a very close interest in this new policy, which will become the common European security and defence policy, and we will have occasion to discuss it often in the future.
Today, knowing that this issue is to be discussed at the Feira Summit, we would like to ask you about the intentions of the Council and the Commission, and also to share our views and hopes with you.
We shall be expressing these in the resolution which we are to vote on, I hope, tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to thank you for the opening statements you have just made, including your words on the pointlessness of a possible revision of the Treaties.
I am now speaking in my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but in more general terms, I think I can say that the great majority of the European Parliament, which does not mean unanimously, approves, as I do, of the new impetus that the Cologne and Helsinki Summits have given to this policy since the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Bosnia and Kosovo, as Mr Brok reminded us a few minutes ago, demonstrated - if proof were necessary - Europe' s shortcomings, both in terms of prevention and of how we manage crises and extricate ourselves from them.
We also observed that we were still too dependent on the United States for our security.
In short, we are satisfied with the guidelines and with the decisions that have been adopted over the last year but we expect the Feira Summit and then the French Presidency to continue and expedite their actual implementation.
In fact, we currently have what could be called a 'window of opportunity' following the shock that has been felt across the Balkans.
Unless we take advantage today of these favourable circumstances, we fear that this new policy may become bogged down in various procedures that will, in fact, paralyse it.
That being the case, the European Parliament must draw a clear distinction between civilian and military crisis management.
The former is obviously the approach we favour.
In this area, the Commission has an essential role to play and we welcome the efforts that have been made recently, Commissioner, but I must stress a few specific points.
How can we further improve our swift decision-making and rapid action capabilities?
By the same token, how can we guarantee effective coordination, which is a continual problem, between the Council, the Council' s High Representative, the Commission, and in some cases, Member States, NGOs etc?
In order to achieve this, we strongly urge the Council and the Commission to set the major common objectives known as 'Headline Goals' in advance so that everyone knows in advance what they can or must do, when confronted with a sudden crisis.
Finally, I would remind you of our commitment to creating a European civilian peace corps, with the same rationale: speed and efficiency.
What do you intend to do, Commissioner?
Whatever course of action we may prefer for dealing with crises through civilian means, we know perfectly well that we also need military means, if only to deter certain parties from committing barbarous acts.
There is still much to be done to ensure that the European Union has adequate military resources, which is why we are putting these questions to you.
We are questioning you about the establishment of a rapid reaction force, which must be operational within three years, and on the creation of political and military decision-making structures, as has been provided for a few months now.
What is the state of play?
We are asking you about restructuring the armed forces in order to improve their training, equipment and ability to work together, regardless of their country of origin.
We also wish to question you as to the state of play with regard to the necessary restructuring of the armament and military hardware industries and the budgetary resources that might prove necessary.
With regard to our relations with NATO, I paid great attention to what you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
This is a very important and sensitive point, especially as it relates to the future of the European Union.
Finally, Mr President, I shall in turn stress a matter to which the European Parliament understandably attaches great importance: the parliamentary dimension of security and defence policy.
Even if the executive must always have overall responsibility for this matter, we must stress the role of parliaments, both national parliaments and the European Parliament.
So far, you have kept rather quiet on this point.
Mr President, the decisions made at the Helsinki European Council on the development of a common security and defence policy are open to interpretation.
Many aligned countries believe that the formation of a common military force would mean the start of a common defence arrangement.
Their plans are clear.
Under the treaties, the aim of a common foreign and security policy for the Union is to safeguard its independence and integrity, as well as strengthen its security in all its forms.
The military force to be established is, in their view, a tool to realise these aims: a common army for a Union that is becoming a federation.
In the opinion of the non-aligned Member States, only the creation of a system for crisis management has been decided upon.
They stress that each country should decide separately on its involvement.
They believe that they have no obligation to become involved in enforcing peace.
Non-aligned Member States do not want the Union to become a military alliance or military superpower.
These differences of opinion and interpretation must be taken into account.
It is also wise in security policy to establish differentiated integration.
Combined troops of the European Union should only be used for crisis management.
Countries which are part of the federal core, as proposed by Messrs Delors, Giscard d' Estaing, Schmidt and Fischer, could create a defence community, to form a strong European pillar within the context of NATO.
The understandable and commendable aim by the European NATO countries to develop a European defence identity should thus be realised within the context of NATO itself.
Decisions relating to security and defence policy are immensely important, and should therefore be made with the emphasis on openness and democracy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is useful to remind ourselves and to realise that we are in the first round of many of a debate on European security.
This means that we have imposed a few restrictions on ourselves.
We are very much focusing on the Summit, the European Council of Feira, which is fine, but that means that we will not be covering a number of other issues which are vital to European security.
One such issue which we are not discussing today is the criteria for the deployment of this rapid reaction force.
I am sure that we will be discussing this issue following a further report by Mrs Lalumière in due course, but in the meantime, we are subject to a few restrictions.
Despite these restrictions, we are able to pass a sound verdict now, in my opinion.
Let me start by making a positive comment.
A large part of the resolution is taken up by non-military crisis management, and this is very much how it should be, in my opinion.
The Commissioner spent quite a long time talking about this and I think he had every reason to.
According to my group, the EU has unique opportunities in this respect which, so far, have remained for the most part untapped.
Fortunately, there are also examples of how things can be done, for example, the Stability Pact, which is a mixture of economic reconstruction, promotion of human rights and the development of a civil society.
This is a good example of how, also in future, the Union will be able to use its nearly unlimited options in the field of non-military crisis management.
But military resources also form part of this package and, this may surprise some delegates, this is also largely backed by my group, albeit subject to a number of conditions.
I would like to specify two.
One is the EU' s say.
In my opinion, it should be crystal clear, and this is not included in the present texts, that the EU has autonomous power of decision and that the EU countries must be able to decide for themselves on their level of commitment, without needing permission from NATO - or should that be the US?
I would like to make one final point.
It cannot be the case that the new military resources which are required will be over and above the ones we have at the moment and that, as such, a new arms race would be created for military resources.
What is important is that the analysis and security policy are new.
This does not necessarily include more resources.
Mr President, there are matters which give rise to fundamental differences of opinion and this is obviously one of them.
You, Mrs Lalumière, have obtained the backing of a large majority in committee and you will no doubt maintain this majority in plenary.
This majority confirms the quality of your work and the care which has gone into it.
But it also confirms how weak the critical voices have become.
I do not see this is a cause for celebration.
Even official threat analyses confirm that there is no military threat to the countries of western Europe.
Instead, scenarios such as the war in Kosovo or imaginary crises in the future, Islamic fundamentalism or, as in the German defence guidelines, even possible ecological threats are wheeled out in order to justify huge military spending.
It marks the capitulation of politics and of the intellect, when such problems are met with a military response.
Let me pick up on just one issue, an issue which figured at the centre of all the positions taken here today: the war in Kosovo.
I think that the Council, the Commission and we ourselves are drawing the wrong conclusions in principle from a war which was wrong in principle.
First, the violation of international law, as practised by NATO, and which, for the rest, still forms part of the official NATO military strategy, should not shape future security policy.
Secondly, I am convinced that the war against Yugoslavia could and should have been avoided with a consistent, preventive, long-term policy, especially as events over the last few days have again shown dramatically that its alleged or actual aim of safeguarding human and minority rights failed disastrously.
War, if anything, is the most unsuitable and most counter-productive method in this respect.
Finally, when it is again argued that the war in Kosovo demonstrated that the EU needs major military independence from the USA then, to my mind, this begs the conclusion that militarising international relations and security policy will increase, not reduce dependency on the USA.
Military is what the USA does best.
My group takes an opposing view in principle to the present prevalent European security policy on at least three counts.
First: the security policy template is a military, not a political, civil or cooperative one and the section on preventive and civil security policy cannot hide that fact.
It is interesting that military resolutions have been coming thick and fast since the Helsinki Summit while, to all intents and purposes, nothing has been done about a civil, cause-orientated security policy.
Secondly: we reject a European military block formation.
The only viable approach, in our view, is to restore the central role of the UNO for international security, reinforce the OSCE, design cooperative security concepts and radically disarm.
Thirdly: we are deeply concerned at how automatically demands are rejected which, until just recently, formed part of a broad political consensus, at least between Mrs Lalumière and, for example, the positions represented in my group.
In all events, demands for an unequivocal declaration on the UN charter, defence of the ABM treaty, respect for the policy of neutrality of certain EU Member States or an increase in funds for peace education and peace studies failed to muster a majority in committee.
Germany has earmarked DM 17.5 million for civil conflict management projects this year.
I think it is a fairly typical figure.
It represents - and let me say this very slowly - 0.00029% of military spending.
I fear that this policy first creates crises which it then endeavours to control.
Which is why there is nothing left for us but to say a firm No.
Mr President, we take a different approach to the important point raised by our colleague, Mr Brok' s question to the Council.
This is an important issue, because, following the very serious crises that have struck the Balkans, the European Council, especially in its Cologne and Helsinki declarations of June and December 1999 and the Presidency, particularly in the two reports it has drawn up on the Union' s military and civilian resources for dealing with crisis situations, have demonstrated their intention to see the Union become more closely involved in the management of crises that threaten European security, interests and values.
A number of European Union Member States, but also non-members, may perceive such threats as common threats.
The issue of concern to us, then, is how we envisage establishing an intergovernmental process which deals with each country individually and which would allow all the States that wish to commit themselves, to actually do so and combine forces, while not forcing any State that does not so desire to take part against their will in a course of action of which it may not approve.
The organisation of this kind of intervention capability must not, however, be designed in ideological terms, as a factor to make political integration binding.
Such an approach would lead to failure.
It must be seen in terms of specific crisis situations which are likely to occur, whilst respecting the freedom and the will of each of our States.
Treating each case individually will enable us to do this and to establish a type of reaction that is appropriate to the type of crisis and in line with the will of the people.
Furthermore, the question of the financial resources allocated to the establishment of civilian and military capabilities which are likely to be united is obviously a crucial one.
It requires significant budgetary input and therefore a radical reversal of the trend that has been seen in most Member States, unlike the United States, since the end of the cold war.
It would be useful to know whether the Council feels that the upturn in growth in Europe is such as to favour this essential turnaround and how the Council intends to promote it.
Mr President, with regard to defence, the Council which is to be held in Feira on 19 and 20 June will work on the basis of the conclusions of the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Fifteen Member States in the Azores and on the conclusions of the meeting of the Defence Ministers of the WEU Member States.
These proposals establish the principles of the common European security and defence policy as laid down in Helsinki, according to which, on the one hand, NATO will remain the basis for the collective defence of its members, and on the other, the European Union will take action only when NATO as a whole has not committed itself.
Mr Javier Solana, High Representative of the CFSP and secretary-general of the WEU, personifies the 'Natoisation' of European defence.
For, unfortunately, we already know what the results of the Feira Summit will be.
Europe' s common foreign and security policy will be brought into line with the desires of the Washington Government, through the good offices of NATO.
NATO, which was created in 1949 to defend Western Europe against Soviet imperialism, ought to have disappeared at the same time as the Soviet Union did, in 1991.
By some extraordinary paradox, the opposite has come about.
France, which left NATO thirty years ago, has now rejoined.
The 50 000 soldiers of Eurocorps have been under NATO command since 1993, and above all, whilst NATO had done nothing for the people of Berlin, Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland, it engaged in a brutal and massive intervention specifically to destroy Serbia' s civil infrastructures, yet without thereby solving the problems of Kosovo.
The fact is that today NATO is, more than anything, an instrument for American domination of our countries.
Here too, the means that were put in place a while ago are now being used against Europe: the 100 000 NSA agents, who spy on telephone and computer communications, and the relaunch of the Star Wars programme which will put an end to the balance of deterrence.
This desire to ensure the continuity of American domination in the field of defence, expressed by Vice-President Al Gore, is not in itself reprehensible from his point of view.
What is serious, however, is the subservience of European defence to Washington' s policy, with the backing and the active participation of Europe' s political leaders.
Mr President, I am very grateful to the person who submitted the oral questions for creating the opportunity, before the Feira Summit, to debate the CFSP, which is shrouded in mystery.
Its lack of transparency is characterised by a multitude of initiatives and ever changing coalitions.
I would nonetheless like to try to make a few observations.
First of all, I wonder whether the creation of a European identity is backed by sound motives.
I would like to stress that we should not be guided by power motives.
If we only focus on a strong role for Europe on the world stage, then we have got it all wrong.
It is not about power, but about taking responsibility.
This cannot be done without joining forces with NATO as the latter has all the necessary resources available.
I should also like to warn against all too unrealistic expectations as far as cooperation between the Member States in this respect is concerned.
A realistic view of the current developments in Europe shows that paper declarations from St. Malo, Cologne and Helsinki have so far not been accompanied by real security guarantees.
The required "firm political commitment on the part of all Member States" of Paragraph 19 of the resolution is lacking.
These brief comments do not detract from the fact that it is important to include this subject on the IGC agenda.
We need plain agreements on competencies in this field.
And as far as we are concerned, these are still mainly within the national state.
Mr President, we must recognise that the progress that has been made in recent months in the field of security and defence policy originated from the informal Council of Defence Ministers in Sintra, which should be included on the list of successes of the Portuguese Presidency.
One of the many and complex problems involved in the development of this policy, which necessarily requires greater involvement by Finance Ministers and Defence Ministers, is the role and influence of the institutions.
At this initial stage, Mr President, Parliament should be more involved in the development of this policy.
We should be thinking about a parliamentary dimension for the common security and defence policy which includes the establishment of mechanisms necessary for Parliament to participate, with its corresponding institutional role, in the definition and the objectives of that policy.
Furthermore, the appropriate measures should be taken for the Parliament to exercise control over the security and defence policy and so that it is constantly and adequately informed of its tasks and of the provisional bodies which currently work in the service of the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
What I have just said with regard to Parliament, Mr President, is equally valid for the Commission.
The balance between the institutions should not be altered in the case of such an important question.
We should clarify the competencies of the Commission and the Council, since there is an unresolved tension between intergovernmental and Community powers.
The ambiguity with regard to the limits of the Commission' s role is particularly evident in the field of security and should be clarified once and for all, since we must not forget that the harmonious partnership between Parliament and the Commission has given rise to the successes of the European integration project, and we should work and fight for its restoration.
Furthermore, Mr President, this European Union project is not just a matter of a political, economic and military union.
Our project is based, or should be based, fundamentally on a community of values.
We in the European Union do not simply define ourselves as consumers in a big market place, but as citizens of the Union.
The citizens of the Union, represented by Parliament, increasingly want to be involved in this area which concerns them and affects them directly, namely the common security and defence policy.
Mr President, last month we celebrated Europe Day.
Central to this was Robert Schuman' s speech of 9 May 1950.
A lot has changed since then, but Robert Schuman' s and Jean Monnet' s basic axiom to the effect that a lasting peace is created by weaving peoples and nations together in mutually enriching dependence is still valid.
Security is created through cooperation pure and simple, as well as through integration and enlargement.
Schuman began his speech with these words: 'World peace cannot be preserved without constructive efforts to combat impending dangers' .
This far-sighted approach permeates the Socialist Group' s vision of Europe' s foreign and security policy and is also a persistent theme in Mrs Lalumière' s report on the eve of Feira, a report which our Group supports wholeheartedly.
For Social Democrats like ourselves, there are two complementary dimensions to the challenge of security policy in the twenty-first century.
The first is the global dimension, and the second is the purely European dimension.
Seen in a global perspective, security is clearly indivisible.
We share the same planet and the same fate.
In today' s globalised world following the end of the cold war, poverty and exclusion stand out as the main enemies of peace and democracy.
No military arsenals and no new nuclear arms race can provide security against the resentment of the poor.
Generous, fair and far-sighted aid, together with a trade policy which attacks the causes of poverty and insecurity must therefore be an integral part of our foreign and security policy.
In the same way, we must look at conflict prevention and crisis management in the context of our new European security policy.
We are, of course, loyal to the decisions taken in Helsinki.
We should constructively develop the military capacity which the war in Kosovo, in particular, has necessarily brought about.
The headline goals which have been established are important and must be implemented in full, without delay and without exception.
At the same time, we must, however, oppose those who wish to exaggerate our military capacity and role.
We should accept increased responsibility for security on our own continent, but we should not take the place of NATO or create an embryonic form of permanent and independent European defence.
Such ambitions are pure fantasy and mere tilting at windmills.
A policy on conflict prevention is missing from our arsenal.
We must therefore actively support the proposals tabled by Commissioner Patten and also by the Council, together with the proposals in Mrs Lalumière' s report.
Mr President, slowly and all too belatedly, a common European security policy is in the process of taking shape, one which, though it leaves a bad taste in the mouth to say so, is, at it were, being built on the ruins of Kosovo.
The EU did not manage to stop the catastrophe in the Balkans in time, and we shall forever be accountable to our children for this failure.
As Liberals, we consider it absolutely crucial for the EU to be able in future to intervene with personnel and resources in countries in its immediate vicinity, to be able to engage in civil crisis management, humanitarian efforts and peace-keeping exercises based on European values and human rights.
The EU must adopt a credible and independent policy in this area, but it is important to retain the commitment of the United States and the transatlantic link.
NATO is at present the most important organisation for peace and security in Europe.
The EU' s Member States must nonetheless soon come to some definite decisions about the common security policy.
There are three main questions which must be answered at Feira and which I want to submit to the Council.
What is the distribution of labour between the EU and NATO to look like?
We must develop complementary, and not duplicate, structures.
How will it be possible to guarantee the influence of the non-aligned States upon expanding security policy?
Thirdly, a question in connection with which there are many good proposals in Mrs Lalumière' s excellent report: how will it be possible for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to be guaranteed influence upon, and participation in, the decisions so that the latter are made openly and democratically in the interests of our European citizens?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the priorities for Feira, the European Union must strengthen the civil conflict prevention dimension of its policy.
That means, as far as weighting instruments is concerned, that the financial and material focus must be on an effective conflict prevention policy.
The main lines of conflict today are to be found in domestic conflicts and this proves that the rich countries lack the will to do enough to foster sustainable and socially-balanced development in the crisis regions.
The opportunity was missed in Helsinki to give concrete expression to an active prevention policy and efficient and prompt crisis management and we urgently need to make up lost ground here.
I congratulate Mr Patten on his activities in this direction, which I should like to support and help develop further.
In building up conflict prevention and after-care instruments, the focus needs to be on combining a reduction in the production and sale of arms and stricter controls.
One more point: the importance of Parliament.
There is a risk in the numerous informal circles of totally inadequate democratic control of a European security policy, which is why the European Parliament needs to take the lead.
Its position must be strengthened and this point needs to be entered on the agenda for Feira.
Mr President, Europe is in the unique position of not having any enemies who threaten it militarily.
This might therefore be the time for extensive military disarmament in Europe but, in reality, rearmament is taking place.
Nor is this new military force of 50 000 to 60 000 men to be used within the EU' s own territories.
There is, in fact, no common defence commitment.
Rather, it is a question of operating outside the EU' s borders.
It is about intervention.
Some might even go so far as to say that attacks may actually be mounted one of these days.
I am concerned about statements to the effect that the EU should be able to intervene anywhere in the world where there are threats to the Union' s security, interests and values.
To me, it sounds as if, in this area too, the EU has the United States' superpower policy as a model for its development.
Mr President, I too would like to express my great appreciation for the work of Mrs Lalumière, who has produced an extraordinarily sound document which is also carefully thought out.
It has been discussed at length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and has put us on the right track.
Mr President, a European Union which cannot play a clearly defined role in terms of security and defence creates uncertainty on the world stage.
In tandem with the Commission and Council, Parliament would like to contribute to a transparent and convincing policy.
After all, the European Union cannot escape its responsibility which is commensurate with its economic and cultural stature.
The Christian Democrats hope that the transfer of tasks and competencies from the Western European Union to the European Union can contribute to this clarity.
As the President-in-Office of the Council pointed out, this naturally means that the budget of what may be left of the WEU will be drastically reduced but, to our great amazement, he is at the same time quite negative about the idea that the European Union' s budget should increase accordingly in this respect.
This seems extremely illogical to me and leads me to believe that this development is not taken altogether seriously.
Mr President, we have emphasised the civil and military aspects of this policy in our resolutions.
Both play a major role and the military component should explicitly be embedded in the wider context of the civil component.
These are not just pious words, they also have an immediate implication for the way in which this policy is supervised.
This is why it is essential that this European Parliament, in which we discuss all kinds of civil affairs with each other all the time, be the place where the military components form part of a wider context in parliamentary supervision too.
We know that the civil components will always take priority and the military components will in the first instance be used as a big stick and a last resort.
It would therefore be dangerous if this policy were not entirely supervised by us.
I also have to say that the nature of the tasks which we have in mind, the Petersberg tasks, is such that here is the ideal place where they can be dealt with.
As champions of a Community policy, we are particularly keen for the European Commission' s input, as Mr Patten described it a moment ago, to be at its best.
This means therefore that the Council must make this possible and that the personnel and budget required for this should be adequate.
Mr President, we do not want to disconnect these tasks from cooperation with North America.
Obviously not.
In fact, we are very keen for our security to be undivided.
This is why it was with some hesitation that, in another resolution, we in the meantime urged that a position be adopted on America' s inclination to determine its own security unilaterally via the ABM system.
We do not want this.
We want to cooperate with North America in these matters too, but also - and particularly - with sound backing from the Council.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the excellent work of our rapporteur, Catherine Lalumière, we are now able to present Parliament' s position in the run-up to the European Council in Feira.
She has succeeded in describing a really accurate and balanced position with which a large majority of the political forces here in Parliament can identify.
Thank you, Catherine Lalumière.
The war in and about Kosovo has made Europeans realise three important things.
First, that we need to give ourselves conflict prevention capabilities.
So far, we have had neither the political mechanisms nor the instruments to prevent or settle conflicts.
If we want to avoid war, we need to give ourselves this capability.
I am delighted that you, Commissioner Patten, take this same view and look forward to hearing your proposals, the Commission' s proposals.
Secondly, we have learned that we are unable to intervene independently on our own continent and in our own neighbourhood, even in the case of very limited military action.
Thirdly: we have learned that we need to be independent from our American friends if we want to control the means to be deployed in a military conflict.
In other words: if we are dependent on others when it comes to reconnaissance, transport, attacking capacity and other such aspects, then we are fighting their war, not ours.
These realisations have resulted in the European Union' s at long last tackling and stepping up its efforts to define, organise and restructure a common security and defence policy.
Today' s debate is the European Parliament' s contribution to these efforts on the part of the European Union as a whole.
As the European security and defence policy develops further, the Commission and European Parliament are increasingly being sidelined.
The European Parliament should also gain greater influence on military action through the budget and proper accountability through the Council.
If the Union only deals with civil and police matters whilst the governments' exclusive remit is military aspects, then the unity of European action is in danger of becoming the first casualty in crisis situations.
There can be no artificial divide between humanitarian aid and military action.
The idea of a joint European and national Assembly has not been sufficiently developed by a long chalk.
Will it need to be more than an informal conversation club?
Will it be given competencies at the expense of national parliaments?
It should in any event not cause this Parliament to be sidelined even further during the development of the European security and defence policy.
Mr President, I hope that Mrs Lalumière' s sterling report will this time not only meet with widespread agreement in Parliament but will also be heard in the Council.
But all too often the Council puts to one side what has been decided within the European Parliament, by consensus or not, as the case may be.
European unification is born from a desire for sustainable peace.
This is a leading concept which recurs in many interventions.
The Common Foreign and Security Policy should therefore forge a unity between political decision-making, conflict prevention, crisis management, possibly military action - only if need be, and ideally not - plus a plan to return to peace afterwards and to keep this peace.
I am not only thinking of Kosovo, which has been so important to us as an eye-opener.
The failure throughout the former Yugoslavia has shown that European helplessness and fragmentation between the different governments do not lead to a prospect of joint peace.
This peace is communal and it should also be maintained communally.
Mr President, the resolution proposed by Mrs Lalumière seeks parliamentary backing in the form of proposals for the necessary means and structures so that the European Union can assume international policing duties alongside ÍÁÔÏ, especially when and where ÍÁÔÏ fails to act immediately, as specified at Helsinki.
Unfortunately, this philosophy, as can be seen from the debate, prevails not only in the Council and the Commission, but also in the European Parliament which, instead of expressing the feelings and interests of the citizens, is about to ratify an extremely dangerous policy for Europe and mankind as a whole.
Not only are we ignoring the blatant crimes committed and being committed in Yugoslavia, we are also being called upon to support the need to repeat them with more efficient means and procedures.
The following questions must inevitably be asked: who gives us the right, on any pretext, to bomb, kill and trample the fundamental principles of international law underfoot?
How should we describe someone who stirs up tension and conflict between peoples inside countries and then uses that tension and conflict to control and plunder the countries in question?
But, even if international alliances are still prepared to commit such crimes today, the people will soon form their own peaceful front against these criminal policies.
I do not congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lalumiere;
I am disgusted by her proposal.
Mr President, the challenge confronting us is how Europe can do more for crisis prevention and management, and the proposals which we are debating are the only way we can achieve that more effectively.
I congratulate the Commissioner on the lead he is setting for greater efficiency not only in aid, but also in this area.
I thank him particularly for his undertaking to examine my proposal for a European public security force, because there are several organisations across Europe which could offer experience, not least the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.
I want to address a word to people in London.
It is reported in the newspapers that certain people in London are saying they would end the EU's involvement in the defence process.
To London I say: you cannot do that; be realistic!
You could possibly end the UK's involvement, but you cannot stop what the European Union is doing.
Please face reality.
This is a valuable new development in which we are involved and which we are debating.
We must try to shape it positively.
I look forward to further debate on these questions, being Parliament's rapporteur on the Rapid Reaction Facility that we will be dealing with later in the year.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Lalumière, on the report which she produced for our Parliament and in which she managed to strike a fine balance.
Cologne and Helsinki have added substance to the common European security and defence policy.
With unusual drive, the European Council has taken a number of important decisions, of which we have taken note and for which we have given due credit.
The aim is to develop our own capacity in order to be able to implement the so-called Petersberg tasks.
A decision has been made on the extent of the troops required in this respect.
A draft of the necessary decision-making mechanisms is in place.
A small-scale NATO is emerging.
In this context, I would like to emphasise two incisive questions, which are a small selection from a long series of matters which are being discussed here today.
The European Union must be able to act autonomously.
This may sound obvious, but this statement also touches upon an enormous problem.
What does autonomous mean in relation to NATO?
There is some confusion surrounding this on both sides of the Atlantic and this should be resolved soon.
Autonomy should certainly not culminate in a political exchange between the common European security and defence policy and the national missile defence, as was suggested recently by an American senator during the NATO Assembly in Budapest.
In summary, the question which I would like to put to the Council is: what is autonomy in this context?
Is action within a NATO context always the first option, as the Americans claim?
Should NATO be given first refusal before the European Union can act autonomously or will the European Union allow itself more room for manoeuvre?
I have the impression that this question is being avoided on both sides of the Atlantic, which will compromise future cooperation.
The second point is about democratic control.
In the Netherlands, there has been a lot of discussion recently about who was involved in what decisions in Bosnia and Kosovo.
This mainly relates to the government.
But if some kind of policy of faits accomplis is already mentioned sometimes at this level, then what about parliamentary control?
Will the common European security and defence policy turn into a cosy intergovernmental get-together or will national parliaments and the European Parliament be truly involved?
Here too, the pertinent question arises as to whether the Council pays any attention to this at all?
Operating at an informal level has its advantages but not if issues of war or peace are involved.
The support base required for using the EU military instrument needs to be more extensive than that required for creating it.
Mrs Lalumière' s resolution contains a relevant proposal for tackling the threat of a democratic deficit in this connection.
The government conference can benefit from this.
The least the European Parliament could ask for is to be considered a fully-fledged partner in this very important debate.
It is disturbing to note the major rush towards the militarisation of the European Union.
The last speaker said that a small-scale NATO is emerging.
Many Members, especially citizens in neutral countries, have no say on whether this is what they want.
In my own country the vast majority of people are against the militarisation of Europe, especially a Europe that will have nuclear weapons at its disposal, a Europe where the arms industries are exporting arms to places around the world where there are mass and gross abuses of human rights.
If we look at the track record of the European Union on its involvement in many conflict areas around the world, we see that the arms industries have been part of that problem.
We need to address that.
With respect to the neutral countries, some of the wording in this resolution is extremely ambiguous in relation to collective defence.
We in the neutral countries are being told that collective defence is not going to be part of it, but of course when we get in so far then there will be no going out.
Finally, I was quite amazed to hear Mr Newton Dunn cite the RUC as a good example of policing.
If you look at the human rights organisations around the world that have amassed damning reports on that organisation, it is incredible to put it up as an example.
I am sure there are good examples, but the RUC is not one of them.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several speakers have referred to the importance of the European security and defence policy.
I should like to confine myself to the question of democratic and parliamentary control of this policy.
Peace and security are not suitable subjects for Council meetings in camera.
They must be subject to parliamentary control.
It is important for decisions on military intervention to remain the responsibility of national parliaments.
It is also important for budgetary questions and national defence budgets to continue to be decided in national parliaments.
But everything over and above that, all questions of civil policy, come under the jurisdiction of the European Parliament.
This European security and defence policy must be subject to parliamentary monitoring in this House.
The President-in-Office has said that transparency and clarity are needed.
It was clever to pretend that the aim is to integrate the Western European Union in the European Union, which is why the debates currently being held within the Western European Union are so absurd, trying as they are to invent a new identity for the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union.
Every iota of strength is being used at the moment to define new remits, even going so far as a European assembly for security and defence, yet another committee to add to the confusion, rather than to increase transparency.
I am reminded of the policy of the Christmas goose trying to postpone Christmas.
It would be good if more transparency were to reign here and if we were to come to accept that the European Parliament is the right forum.
We attended the NATO assembly a few days ago, where the president of the North Atlantic assembly stated that the Western European Union was merging into the European Union, that the EU had a parliament, that NATO had a parliament and that the WEU assembly therefore had no further raison d' être.
I think that is also our position and account should be taken of it at this Summit.
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mrs Lalumière on producing a report which is a fine balance of the arguments and interests involved.
It is a remarkable achievement.
I also wish to congratulate the Council on being able to establish at the last summit the principle of the headline goals.
It is important to realise the significance of these headline goals because for once, instead of spending years discussing institutions, the European Union has put results before means.
That, as we are already seeing, will drive forward the agenda very rapidly.
If we are to succeed in our ambitions at a price we can afford, we have to ensure that we get better value for money out of defence and, in particular, defence industries.
We need a strong, competitive European defence industry.
Notwithstanding the takeovers and mergers in the private sector, there is still far too much fragmentation in this area.
We still rely heavily on intergovernmental activity.
The Western European Union Armaments Group, for example, moves very slowly on the basis of consensus.
Even the six EU Member States which two years ago signed a letter of intent on cooperation have still not agreed a framework agreement to implement that letter of intent.
We clearly need more urgency in this area and we need a single, coherent framework within which the defence industry can cooperate.
That is why I am disappointed to hear what the presidency said about the intention to continue with the work of the Western European Armaments Group.
I believe the pillar structure of the EU provides us with the best opportunity for a framework within which industry can operate.
Pillar II can provide the common positions on things like arms exports, and we could be working towards a European armaments agency which brings together OCCAR and the Western European Armaments Organisation.
The Commission has a crucial role in this.
The last Commission drove forward the agenda on restructuring the defence industries: there were two communications.
This Commission has been completely silent on this issue.
It is as if it is running scared from confronting the implications of its role as the guardian of the Treaties.
We have to ensure that the single market applies to defence industries as far as possible, and that Article 296 only applies in those areas specified in the Treaty.
I would urge Commissioner Patten to follow in the footsteps of Commissioners Bangemann and van den Broek to drive forward the Commission's responsibility in delivering an effective and competitive European armaments industry in order to back up the measures we are taking in the political field.
Mr President, considerable progress has been made towards the establishment of a common European security and defence policy.
The Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon Councils have all made significant contributions in that regard.
However, in all truth it must be said that decisions taken at these summits and any that may be taken at Feira will remain little more than aspirational until the Union has the necessary resources to implement such a policy.
I agree with the recent comments of Commissioner Patten when he criticised EU governments for making ringing declarations which they are reluctant to underwrite with money and staff.
If Member States are indeed serious about establishing a real security and defence policy then they must put their money where their mouth is.
In the meantime we have to be realistic about what we can achieve and at the moment we cannot talk about operational autonomy for any European force.
This will always be relative to our dependence and reliance on NATO which still owns the essential military hardware and which enabled EU governments to deploy their troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
Unless and until we have a sufficient intelligence capability matching that of the US and the transport capabilities to put EU military personnel into world trouble spots quickly, we will continue to need a close working relationship with NATO underpinned by a structured EU-NATO dialogue which is not simply a replication of the WEU/NATO acquis.
These realities must temper our discussions at Feira and elsewhere as must also the need to keep in mind the status and role of the United Nations.
Let me conclude by saying I welcome the speculation that the Feira Council will endorse the concept of a rapid reaction police force which would swing into action after completion of military tasks.
The experience of Kosovo has underlined the need for such an initiative and I welcome the fact that it may happen at Feira.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, a common foreign, security and defence policy has recently developed in the European Union which would probably have been unthinkable a few years ago.
It has come about because two main groups of members in the European Union have shifted their position: those who believed that NATO alone was responsible for security and defence, and those who believed that security and defence were not a Community affair and should be dealt with by individual states either neutrally or within a pact.
I think that what is happening today is a positive sign of community and solidarity.
I also think that, in the final analysis, Article 5, which has been quoted several times today, should represent the common basis for all members of the European Union, even if this can only be achieved gradually.
Kosovo has been mentioned several times today.
I think that too one-sided a view is sometimes taken of the lessons to come out of Kosovo and the Balkans.
In fact, four issues are at stake.
First, prevention, of which there was practically none whatsoever in the case of Kosovo.
Secondly, deterrence, of which there was certainly too little in the case of Kosovo, because no common will was visible.
Thirdly, the facility for rapid, targeted intervention.
This functioned perhaps to a certain extent, although the fight about what constitutes the optimum form of intervention blocked a great deal.
And fourthly, the restoration and stabilisation of peace, including after military intervention.
Developments over the past few days show that it is not as easy as you might think.
I am particularly thankful that the question of the police and security forces in Kosovo has been raised several times today, because it is essential to establish security by strengthening the presence of police troops.
There is also the question of developing a system of regional responsibility in Europe which does not fly in the face of the United Nations system, as has been maintained time and again, but which, on the contrary, can be incorporated into the United Nations system and into the ideas of the United Nations.
Finally, Commissioner Patten has said that we do not necessarily need institutional revolution, perhaps just reforms.
But we should try for institutional revolution.
As far as the institutions to be set up in the near future referred to today are concerned, I am afraid that we will paint ourselves into a corner.
We should not allow too many institutions to exist and the integration of the WEU and the EU forms part of this philosophy.
Mr President, we are regularly reassured that the measures being put in place under the common European security and defence policy are intended to strengthen NATO.
This is somewhat disingenuous.
If this was the intention there would be no need to set up the separate structures which largely exclude the Americans and Canadians and marginalise reliable European allies such as Turkey.
Over the past five years NATO has already restructured for the specific purpose of facilitating European action should the alliance as a whole not wish to be engaged.
But this apparently is not enough.
The real desire is to create something separate from NATO.
Of course we want to see the Europeans reforming and enhancing their military capabilities but I fail to see how the continued reductions that we are seeing in European defence budgets, most notably by Germany, demonstrate resolve to make a greater contribution to Western defence efforts.
The amendments we have put forward to the Lalumière resolution are intended to stress the importance of the continued commitment of our North American allies to the security of Europe as a foremost priority, to make it clear that the European Union should only opt to act militarily in agreement with the alliance and when NATO as a whole has chosen not to be engaged, to insist that any rapid reaction force should also be assigned to NATO and in any case should not impact adversely on the capacity of NATO allies to meet their alliance obligations.
We want EU decisions relating to the use of military assets, including decisions taken on the basis of a common strategy or when implementing a joint action, to be taken unanimously.
There should not be attempts to create a European armed police force behind the cloak of the common European security and defence policy.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary is a fine force with a proud record in fighting terrorism but this is not at all relevant to this particular debate.
Our overall concern is that the common European security and defence policy is indeed a further step towards European political integration and that is our fundamental objection.
Mr President, honourable members, for reasons of security in Europe and in order to safeguard the security of others outside the Union who may need our support, Europe requires an independent military presence which differs from the presence which it has by reason of its membership of NATO.
Events in Kosovo and the whole tragic break up of the former Yugoslavia are proof most painful of Europe' s failings within NATO.
One might even say that Europe has entrusted the task of a military presence to the NATO leadership and, at the same time, relaxed its efforts over the years, to the point at which it is now more or less incapable of properly honouring its obligations within NATO.
There is a psychological explanation for this.
If someone, be it a person, a country or a group of countries, considers that it has no initiative to act, it loses interest, neglects its duties or goes through the motions of performing its duties, but there is no substance to them and they are performed perfunctorily.
Perhaps the most important outcome of the resolutions of the Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon summits is precisely the fact that they have restored Europe' s sense of initiative, giving it the motivation needed in order to accept responsibility, make an effort and honour its obligations.
From this point of view, the draft which we are debating does not constitute a threat to the cohesion of ÍÁÔÏ.
On the contrary, a Europe with its own military initiative will take its NATO obligations more seriously.
It is the only way in which it can take its NATO obligations seriously and reassure the political forces in the United States which object to American armed forces and American resources being tied up in the defence of Europe.
Consequently, Mr President, we must ensure that our immediate decisions are geared towards European unity and the defence of a common border and, sooner or later, that is the point we must reach.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed resolution on a common European security and defence policy is an important signal from the European Parliament in the run-up to the Feira Summit, a signal which points in two directions.
First, a declaration of an independent role for the European Union in both civil and military security policy within a clearly defined remit, as in the Petersberg tasks for maintaining peace and peace-making.
Secondly, a signal to take account of and strengthen the role of the European Parliament in fashioning a common European security and defence policy.
The European Union needs to make up lost ground when it comes to a common security and defence policy if you think that its defence spending does not even equal 60% of comparable spending in the USA and only achieves 10% of the operational efficiency of the USA.
The specific undertaking to create a European strike force no more than 60 000 strong in order to complete the Petersberg tasks calls for solidarity between all the Member States of the European Union.
The lack of any real common foreign and security policy has been exacerbated by the Balkan crisis, which highlighted the weakness of the European Union in this area.
We cannot double the functions of NATO in the area of global security.
We cannot build up an expensive parallel structure.
But completion of the Petersberg tasks must be guaranteed and the principle that security is indivisible must be applied, which is why mutual support, as anchored in Article 5 of the WEU Treaty, must be open to all sides in a revised EU Treaty.
The idea of attaching Article 5 in an additional protocol to a revised Treaty, to which the individual Member States may accede if necessary, therefore represents a reasonable attempt to find a solution.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, honourable members, it is quite right to make crisis management the main objective of European foreign and defence policy.
After all, crises all over the planet are the predominant issue at the dawn of the twenty-first century.
Of course, the current state of the world and the intricacies of the international system also raise other issues and questions which, in my view, form an integral part of the issues and problems which need to inform a specific proposal on European foreign policy.
I should like to congratulate Mrs Lalumière because she has taken a huge step forward in her report.
Not only has she made specific proposals, she has also highlighted the need to find a modus operandi and a modus vivendi for all the means proposed in order to implement European foreign policy.
The problem with a European foreign policy is not quantitative.
There is no problem with the figures.
It is qualitative.
The problem lies in the content.
Having said this, may I suggest, Minister, that we act with the greatest caution when it comes to questions such as the integration of the Western European Union or relations with ÍÁÔÏ.
I, fellow members, shall insist above all on the need to find a system, a modus operandi for all the proposals tabled in the House.
Because foreign policy nowadays cannot and must not merely be the product of simple intergovernmental cooperation.
On the contrary, it must be derived by operating a multi-dimensional structure and system within which the parliamentary aspect plays an important part.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year has gone by since the war in Kosovo, and intensive reconstruction work has begun.
An enormous amount of valuable property has been destroyed.
To avoid similar disasters in the future, we are now taking new steps to establish a common European defence and security policy.
We are doing this in order to join together in creating tools to safeguard the lynchpin of security, namely freedom and peace in Europe.
I am extremely pleased that this process is going on.
Within the framework of the EU' s mandate, this joint commitment is now being carried out and intensified.
I think it is important that the EU should concentrate on what it is good at, namely engaging in trade, developing contacts and taking measures to prevent conflicts.
It is also important, however, to create credibility through 'more muscle' and increased ability to intervene in time.
If (as it wishes, and is endeavouring, to be) the EU is to be taken seriously in the world, it must also demonstrably be able to take more responsibility in its own area.
It is therefore important that we should create structures which cooperate with NATO, for it is there that the competence, capacity, leadership ability and credibility are to be found.
The EU has a complementary role, and that is why Mrs Lalumière' s report is so commendable.
This concept is based upon individual Member States' fulfilling the commitments they have made.
Our main role in the European Parliament is therefore to exercise supervision.
I have previously discussed the shrinking defence budgets of the Member States.
These defence budgets are shrinking at the same time as we require investment in restructuring and new hardware.
Since we last discussed this subject, Germany' s supreme commander has resigned in protest, which is as good a sign as any.
If our heads of State and government are to have any credibility in the year 2003, they should not only talk in Feira, but must also then return home and review the responsibilities of each country and the commitments they have undertaken to fulfil.
Mr President, Secretary of State, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order for the European construction process to maintain its vitality, which is a prerequisite for its survival, each point of arrival must also form a point of departure.
Having achieved economic and monetary union, other plans are now being drawn up.
We cannot take 50 years to implement these, however.
This is the case with the establishment of an effective common European security and defence policy.
The Member States must address this issue from a European perspective which can be fully reconciled with NATO commitments.
Although this was clearly not our desire, the fall of the Berlin wall has obviously not helped with security and defence in Europe.
We are therefore now faced with the complex situation in the Balkans, which throws up new problems on a daily basis.
The lessons of Kosovo show us how not to act and the challenges in the Mediterranean basin are keeping us alert.
After decades of a bipolar world, the situation of unipolarity must be transitory and in this the European Union' s contribution will be decisive.
Peace must continue to be the grand plan of European construction but this will not happen by itself.
We must therefore have effective mechanisms for managing crises using non-military means, for developing and ensuring the compatibility of the military capabilities of the Member States, for mobilising adequate financial resources in the national and Community budgets and for establishing effective decision-making structures.
The choices seem clear, the objective is challenging and its achievement will be decisive.
Reforms must be implemented, major financial resources and means must be identified, made compatible and mobilised.
The commitment of the Member States is essential.
The current challenges cannot be deferred or hesitated over.
The Feira European Council must be more than an occasion to reaffirm our desires.
It must be a turning point characterised by the identification of the necessary financial resources and by the inclusion on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference of the institutional aspects of the Common European Security and Defence Policy.
I congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her work.
- (PT) Mr President, I must very quickly highlight the usefulness of this debate and the importance of all the interventions in terms of better preparing the Council on this issue.
Mrs Lalumière' s report is excellent, particularly in its balance and the relevance of many of its observations.
The report to be presented by the Portuguese Presidency to the Feira European Council next week will dispel many of the doubts and clarify many of the aspects which we have addressed here.
This report is the result of our commitment to carry out in full the mandate established in Helsinki.
Regardless of certain differences which are evident here in terms of security and defence cultures, and more so in the defence culture than in the security culture, we believe that we all agree on the need for the European Union to rapidly acquire a crisis management capability at either military or non-military level.
We must determine the extent of these mechanisms and the appropriateness of these various dimensions in terms which express the different sensitivities indicated here.
I must mention one specific point which was raised with regard to amending the Treaty on European Union and other possible amendments to this Treaty at this stage in order possibly to enshrine in law the EU' s current military mechanisms.
The Portuguese Presidency' s and the Council' s reading of this issue is that there is no need for an immediate amendment of the Treaty and that the provisions of Article 17 are sufficient to cover the current mechanisms.
In any case, the way is clear for future discussion of this issue bearing in mind future developments and what will be enshrined in terms of the definitive structures.
As for the EU-NATO link, all the concerns expressed about how the creation of a common European security and defence policy may reflect negatively on the relationship with NATO are unfounded.
On the contrary, we believe that this mechanism will allow us to independently reinforce a particular dimension without creating any type of barrier in our relationship with NATO.
Moreover, the mechanisms which we are implementing to link Member States who are in NATO with those who are not and, at the same time, the formulas which we are using to link the European Union in terms of security and defence with NATO partners outside the EU seem to have found the right balance.
We hope that the Feira European Council will enshrine these as the definitive model in this area.
On the issue of parliamentary representation, we obviously appreciate the sensitivity of this House with regard to its greater involvement in these matters.
However, we believe that this issue of representation precedes that of security and defence and in fact lies at the level of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the well-known claims made by Parliament with regard to its involvement in this wider policy.
This point has been and is being discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference and we will see to what extent these claims are accepted.
In any case, it is essential, particularly with regard to the national parliaments, to guarantee their association with any future development in this area.
We too share these concerns.
Civilian crisis management has been one of the aspects highlighted by the Portuguese Presidency, particularly bearing in mind the concerns felt within the Council and also expressed in this House about this dimension.
The day after tomorrow the first meeting of the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management will take place.
This Committee was specifically created during the Portuguese Presidency.
Finally, on the last issue of the Armaments Group, this group is continuing its work and will remain active within the WEU.
Mr President, it has been an interesting debate.
We have heard plenty of good sense in the course of it, as one would anticipate.
I shall be mercifully brief.
I do not want to come between Parliament and its preprandial democratic duty.
However, there are a couple of points I should like to make.
Firstly, there was some discussion about the sort of institutional arrangements that we need to make, not least in the Commission, to cope with the responsibilities of adequately implementing a common foreign and security policy and, in particular, to ensure that we can play our own role in the non-military aspects of conflict prevention and crisis management.
We need our own crisis units in the Commission, but we should keep that small.
I want to make it absolutely clear that I have no intention of duplicating within the Commission the sort of structures which are necessarily going to be created in the Council.
Secondly, Mrs Lalumière spoke very pointedly about the importance of taking decisions much more quickly.
I am bound to say that is one of my obsessions.
It is one of my obsessions in relation to, for instance, MEDA regulation and in relation to the Balkans.
We brought forward a new regulation for speeding up our delivery of assistance to the Balkans.
We have made proposals about asymmetric trade measures for the Balkans, which are now being considered by the Council and, in due course, will be considered by Parliament.
We have made proposals for cleaning up the Danube.
Those are all areas where we have brought forward proposals.
I hope we can get quick decisions.
Unless we can take decisions more quickly, before crises happen, then the question of how quickly we take decisions when crises have actually broken will come up a great deal more frequently.
So in my judgement the importance of taking decisions more quickly is one which is relevant at every stage of our activities.
The sooner we face up to that the better, not least for the credibility of a common foreign and security policy.
Once again I thank the honourable Member for her superb report.
I can only imagine the amount of work that went into it.
All of us know the amount of wisdom that went into it as well.
President.
I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Welcome
Colleagues, it is a great pleasure to welcome a delegation from the Australian House of Representatives and the Senate, who have just taken their seats in the official gallery.
I extend a warm welcome to the Australian delegation, which is here to attend the 24th European Parliament/Australia Interparliamentary meeting, taking place here in Strasbourg on 14 and 15 June.
The honourable Bruce Baird heads the Australian delegation, which is composed of three Members of the House of Representatives and two Members of the Senate.
The European Parliament and the Australian Parliament initiated their direct political dialogue in 1981 and over the years this dialogue has encompassed a broad range of issues.
We now look forward to the strengthening of our cooperation with Australia.
I wish you all a successful and an enjoyable stay here in Strasbourg.
Vote
Mr Perry has the floor on a point of order.
Madam President, outside the door of this Chamber there is somebody dressed as a cigarette packet.
I have no objections to people dressing as cigarette packets but I have objections to what I take to be political manifestations outside the very door to the Hemicycle.
Is this allowed under our Rules?
Mr Perry, we take note of your point of order.
I am sure everyone can see the funny side.
Are there any other points of order?
Madam President, I understand that we will be voting on the amendments to the Lalumière resolution tomorrow and not today.
I should like to point out that there is an important typographical error in Amendment No 39, which Members will have.
It mentions the "President of Canada".
This should read: the "Parliament of Canada".
There is no president of Canada.
The head of state of Canada is Her Majesty the Queen, who is also the head of state of Australia.
Calendar of part-sessions of Parliament for the year 2001
Dell' Alba (TDI).
(FR) Madam President, I am tabling a point of order concerning the first vote due to take place, because, I, with forty or so fellow Members, have tabled twelve amendments seeking to transfer all plenary sessions from Strasbourg to Brussels.
These amendments have been deemed to be inadmissible.
I admit that our Rules of Procedure state that we must deliberate on the matter according to the conditions laid down by the Treaties, but I would remind you that, last April, Parliament voted in favour of a resolution, specifically bearing in mind the Intergovernmental Conference that was then taking place, which requested, with a very large majority, that the seat and working centres of the European Parliament should be decided on by Parliament itself.
We could therefore quite easily have voted in favour of our amendments, waited for the results of the IGC and adapted the calendar accordingly.
I dispute the statement that these amendments, supported by many of my fellow Members, are inadmissible.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall just say that the amendments which Mr Dell' Alba has just been speaking about have indeed been deemed to be inadmissible, because Parliament is only entitled to give its opinion on the dates of the part-session as they are presented in the proposal formulated by the Conference of Presidents.
There is therefore some confusion as to what we are voting on.
That is why we did not feel that we could deem these amendments to be acceptable.
On the other hand, all the other amendments have been deemed to be acceptable, and indeed has always been the case.
(Parliament adopted the calendar of part-sessions as amended)
Simplified procedure - without report
Initiative of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg with a view to the adoption of a Council decision establishing a procedure for amending Articles 40(4) and (5), 41(7) and 65(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders (7217/00 - C5-0216/2000 - 2000/0803(CNS)) (Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs)
(Parliament approved the initiative)
Proposal for a Council decision modifying Decision 1999/311/EC of 29 April 1999 adopting the third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (TEMPUS III) (2000-2006) (COM(2000)0184 - C5-0231/2000 - 2000/0074(CNS)) (Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport)

Recommendation for 2nd reading (A5-0153/2000) by Mr Beysen on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the European Parliament legislative resolution on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, with specific reference to a simplified application of the nomenclature of products (14100/1/1999 C5­0134/2000 - 1997/0162(COD))
(The President approved the common position)
Report (A5-0156/2000) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products (COM(1999) 594 - C5­0016/2000 - 1999/0244(COD))
Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to request that the vote on Maaten report be postponed until July.
Mr Fiori, to make things quite clear, you are therefore asking for the vote to be postponed, pursuant to Rule 146(1) of the Rules of Procedure.
Is there a speaker in favour of this request and one against?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is surely an extremely important report on what is without doubt a serious issue.
My own opinion of the legal basis notwithstanding, I really have the greatest respect for the proposals submitted and, above all, for the work carried out by Mr Maaten, who had to process an unbelievably large number of proposals, both in committee and here in Parliament for plenary, in an unbelievably short space of time.
I think that we shall not do justice to the significance and importance of this issue if we complete this procedure in such a short space of time.
There are so many proposals - 120 in all - that I fear that majorities will be reached and results will emerge which are not compatible with each other.
We really do need more careful voting and coordination both in and between the groups so that we achieve a result which is worthy of its name.
With the best will in the world and with the greatest respect for this issue, we must not forget that we really are not under any pressure and we should use the time available to us for careful reflection and review.
Madam President, I must state my opposition to this request to postpone the vote.
I do not think that there is any shortage of arguments against taking such action.
I know that the tobacco industry lobby is most anxious to prevent this directive and I think that this request is yet another ploy to prevent a vote, which is clearly a matter of urgency, from taking place.
I would remind you that the Council postponed its review of this dossier until it had heard Parliament' s views.
If we postpone our vote, the tobacco industry will gain even more time, since the Council will then not be able to state its position until the end of June.
Furthermore, I think that Mr Maaten and the Commission on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have produced a good piece of work.
It is true that many amendments have been tabled and also that in future we will have to make efforts to improve our work so that fewer amendments are tabled in plenary.
As it happens, however, I do not think that this would in any way justify postponing the vote.
Everything is in place for a vote to be held.
(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
I congratulate Mr Maaten and I shall take this opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, to tell you that I have received several letters from Members who would like us to respect the non-smoking areas because they suffer from asthma.

Mr President, I should just like to point out that I believe that the House has passed an illegal resolution in the vote on the calendar because a four-day week in Strasbourg would only be permitted if there were no additional plenary part-session in Brussels or, conversely, I believe that only if the full plenary week has been exhausted is it legal to hold additional plenary part-sessions in Brussels.
Please have the legal implications checked as a matter of urgency.
We have clearly passed a resolution which violates the spirit and probably even the letter of the Treaty.
Because this could result in our holding one-day sessions here and five-day sessions elsewhere.
That cannot be the purpose of the compromise.
Apart from that, it is a huge waste of money to cut a day here and then hold additional plenary part-sessions.
Mr Posselt, firstly, I am doubtful as to whether this is a point of order and, secondly, bearing in mind that, of course, the Bureau is willing to study everything that is asked of it, if that interpretation were indisputable, the amendment that you are criticising would not have been put to the vote in plenary session.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Parliament' s calendar of part-sessions - 2001
Mr President, I rise to register my opposition to the amendments of my own Group with whom I am out of step, and to similar amendments, which seek to eliminate the Friday sittings in Strasbourg or to break up one of the weeks of the part-session into two distinct part-sessions in order to artificially increase the number of part-sessions in Strasbourg and even to the amendments by Mr Pannella and company, seeking to remove Mondays and Fridays from the Strasbourg part-session or to extend the additional part-sessions by two to three or even five days.
All of these amendments are designed to render the Protocol on setting the venues of institutions, which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, meaningless.
They are designed to attempt to eliminate Strasbourg and to concentrate Parliament' s activities in Brussels.
By the same token, and out of respect for the rule of law, I voted against the amendments which seek to cancel the additional part-sessions in Brussels.
It is legitimate to attempt to change the terms of the Treaties regarding our working venues, although it is not an intention that I share.
To whittle away, however, at the provisions of the Treaty and the annexed acts is a method that is not worthy of the parliamentary institution.
Mr President, I voted not to work on Fridays in Strasbourg although I am totally in favour of our meeting here.
I decided to vote not to work on Fridays because Friday was inconvenient for almost all the Members.
I would like to make the following point: we put in a lot of time but we work inefficiently and we produce relatively little compared with, for example, the Italian Parliament, which meets less often - it never votes on a Monday and does not meet on Fridays at all - yet produces at least 500 laws every year.
We are constantly wasting time in fruitless discussion and, in particular, with all these votes, resolutions, motions, urgent debates and so on and so forth which, when all is said and done, do not produce any tangible results and undermine the genuine legislative activity which should be the principle activity of a Parliament which is not an advisory body but an organ which adopts resolutions.
Mr President, I am ashamed to say so but I could not stop myself dozing off a couple of times during the votes which have just taken place and only managed to wake up and cast my vote at the last minute.
This is because Parliament' s work is not being organised properly.
I voted for the calendar but I would like to make it clear - as Mr Speroni has just said - that we waste a great deal of time in fruitless activities.
Voting on the amendments to the recitals of all the legislation, even those which merely lay down guidelines, when all is said done, makes it impossible for us to carry out our mandate.
Directives and regulations should be produced and voted upon in Parliament, but Parliament must not waste time in other sorts of debates which could be dealt with by the committees.
Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Posselt and Mrs Flesch have said about this unfortunate vote on cancelling Friday sittings here in Strasbourg.
I take the view that this violates the Treaty and violates the agreement on where Parliament sits.
I am really pleased that the ministers in the Council of Ministers and not Parliament continue to decide where Parliament sits and I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will not change that.
It is hard to understand why we are passing a resolution on a four-day working week when the Treaty refers to session weeks.
Every employee in the Community, hundreds of millions of people, work a five-day week.
Once we have a four-day week for everyone else, because the self-employed already work whenever they want, then we can also say that a session week is only four days long.
I think it is a disgrace, it is a waste of money and as for the ridiculous ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I too should like to endorse the statement made by my fellow Member from the Liberal Group, Mrs Flesch.
I would like to add something further.
It is a fact that very few Members of the House are present here in Strasbourg on Friday mornings.
Nevertheless, I think it is scandalous that some Members want to prevent others from working on Friday mornings.
What I find even more scandalous is that these Members think - and I have here an e-mail to this effect from Mrs van Hulten to other Members - that when the Friday sitting is removed, it would still be possible, in spite of everything, to register on Fridays, in order to receive one' s salary, even without having worked.
I urge the Bureau to be consistent and to also remove the possibility of MEPs' receiving money for Fridays on which they have not worked!
.
(FR) In the vote on the calendar of part-sessions for 2001, most Members of the European Parliament believed that they had the right to remove Fridays from the monthly Strasbourg part-session.
This is just another episode in the perpetual secret war waged by the anti-Strasbourg faction against the wording of the Treaties.
As far back as 1997, the anti-Strasbourg faction suffered a major defeat at the Court of Justice, having tried to completely remove one of the twelve ordinary monthly part-sessions.
This time, they have tried to achieve their ends in a more subtle way, by cutting the duration of each ordinary part-session, without reducing their number.
In fact, in its Judgement of 1 October 1997, the Court of Justice made it quite clear that the Edinburgh Council Decision of 12 December 1992, which was taken to enforce Article 216 of the Treaty, and was furthermore elevated to the rank of protocol by the Treaty of Amsterdam, was as valid as the Treaty and was therefore binding on the European Parliament.
In the process, the European Parliament suffered the supreme humiliation of being reminded that it is not a sovereign Parliament, like a national Parliament, but merely an assembly established by treaty and subject to the conditions and limitations set by that treaty.
The Edinburgh decision, reiterated in the Amsterdam Protocol, states that "The European Parliament shall have its seat in Strasbourg, where the twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions shall be held..."
In 1997, Mr Lenz, the Advocate-General, stressed the fact that if the text talks about "where the twelve periods of monthly plenary sessions shall be held" and not, for example, twelve plenary part-sessions are to be held at that location, this implies that the representatives of the Member State governments have submitted to a practice followed by the Parliament where its administration is concerned.
This practice, inasmuch as it concerns us today, is that of the ordinary part-sessions in Strasbourg, lasting a full week.
This practice, which serves as a basis for the terms of the Treaty, must be respected.
If we allowed ordinary plenary part-sessions to be cut by one day, the rules could be stretched even further, with the result that Strasbourg would gradually no longer be the location for plenary part-session work.
The wording of the Treaty would, as a result, be undermined by small, gradual steps.
I should like to take this opportunity to remind you that, as I understand it, setting additional part-sessions in Brussels a year in advance is not a practice that is in accordance with the treaty either.
The 1997 judgement states that "additional plenary part-sessions can only be set for another working location if the Parliament holds the twelve ordinary part-sessions in Strasbourg, which is the seat of the institution" .
Quite logically, the Court therefore ruled that there can only be an "additional" part-session if the ordinary part-sessions have been held and if they have actually proven to be insufficient for the task of dealing with the cases under consideration.
I conclude from this that the European Parliament does not have the right to set additional part-sessions more than a year in advance, as it currently does.
Parliament would need to know if the ordinary part-sessions in Strasbourg have been sufficient or insufficient to deal with matters pending.
The fact is that it cannot know this so far in advance.
Furthermore, we might think that it is a contradiction to cut the week of the ordinary Strasbourg part-sessions, whilst maintaining the additional part-sessions in Brussels.
If Parliament feels that we spend too long in sittings, it is the additional part-sessions in Brussels that should be removed first.
I greatly hope that the French Government will again refer the matter to the Court of Justice, as it did in 1995.
I also hope that it will make a genuine effort make the journey to Strasbourg easier for our foreign colleagues.
Why should we be surprised if those Members who have a 10 or 12-hour journey because of poor rail or air connections come to be exhausted and to take a dislike to Strasbourg?
.
(FR) With regard to the calendar for part-sessions in 2001, I must say quite clearly, as someone who has only ever been absent once since the new term on 12 June 1999, that I have always opposed and will always oppose any decision which seeks to make our part-session in Strasbourg meaningless, with the more or less open aim of disputing Strasbourg as the seat of the European Parliament.
Such a decision would not only threaten the institutional balance that has nonetheless been accepted by all Member States, but, even more seriously, it would threaten the 'certain concept of Europe' that Strasbourg symbolises: that of a political Europe that is reconciled and peaceful.
For who can deny that the creation of a single capital for a federal Europe, which will have more than 500 million inhabitants in 10 years' time, would be an aberration?
This would be a disaster in terms of town planning, in terms of the environment and therefore in human terms!
Being modern in the 21st century means having a multipolar capital, at the heart of which Strasbourg will always have a special place.
For all of these reasons, I condemn the ideological and mercenary machinations of the anti-Strasbourg faction, which never misses an opportunity to cause trouble!
.
The current practice of moving Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg implies high costs for the European taxpayer, and reduces the effectiveness of parliamentary work.
It undermines Parliament's credibility and political impact.
The solution to this problem would be to concentrate Parliament's work at only one place.
We call upon the Member States to consider a change of the Treaty, allowing the European Parliament to decide upon its own seat.
In order to make this point we have voted for all amendments that aim to reduce the amount of time spent in Strasbourg and increase that in Brussels.
.
I have not missed one day in any of the Parliamentary sessions since the election and, I believe, only two in the previous Parliament.
It is therefore with some hesitation that I voted for the deletion of Fridays from the Strasbourg sessions.
I have come to the opinion that agendas for the Friday sessions have been engineered to fill up the session and are becoming increasingly meaningless.
It does this institution no favours when, on a Friday, there are fewer than a hundred Members debating a resolution which is of no importance.
This Parliament must restructure its mode of operation to reflect the changed working conditions.
.
(FR) Once again, this agenda item has been used as a pretext in order to make a nonsense of the protocol on the seat of the European institutions.
The vast majority of Members of the European Parliament who voted for the removal of the Friday sitting are pursuing a strategy whose aims are crystal clear: they wish to move more plenary sittings to Brussels.
After the Friday sitting, they will set their sights on Thursday' s sitting.
Once we have cut the part-session in Strasbourg to the length of a mini-session, the same voices will call, on grounds of rationalisation, for an end to Strasbourg' s tenure as the seat of the European Parliament.
Because I do not want to be party to this strategy, I did not vote for the relevant amendments.
Furthermore, I think that it is quite illogical to remove a half-day sitting, whilst, at the same time, complaining that the European Parliament has an excessive workload.
I note that nobody has bothered to add the hours lost on Fridays to the calendar for 2001!
Schengen Agreement
Mr President, I voted for the motion and I would just like to point something out: in Italy, the Schengen Agreement is not always correctly applied.
I refer, in particular, to the systematic border checks carried out by border and financial police on all those who travel from Italy to a Schengen Treaty country by aeroplane, particularly in general aviation aircraft, or what are commonly referred to as private aircraft.
According to the Schengen Agreement, there should not be any systematic checks and there should not be any obligation to present oneself to the Customs authorities or notify them that one is leaving national territory.
I therefore call upon the Commission to take action to ensure that the Schengen Agreement is respected and that the bureaucratic interference of the Italian authorities ceases.
Beysen recommendation (A5-0153/2000)
Mr President, I voted for the Beyson report, but this is a classic example of what I was referring to in the vote on abolishing Friday sittings.
In this document, the European Parliament defines the categories of goods to be taken into consideration in the drawing up of statistics on products which cross the borders between one State and another, although it is not clear what purpose this will serve.
Is it so that we know how many sweets have passed from Italy into France or how many tractors have passed from Germany into Sweden, for example?
This seems to me to be excessive bureaucracy as well as an unnecessary amount of work for Parliament.
Since we are recording the amount of goods which cross the borders, why do we not also record how many people cross from one country to another within the European Union?
But to what end?
We must make life simpler for our citizens and simplify our legislation as well!
Maaten Report (A5-0156/2000)
Mr President, with regard to the revision of the directive on the manufacture, packaging and sale of tobacco products, we have supported the rapporteur' s harshest amendments, because we are convinced that tobacco costs society a great deal and represents an even more serious danger to those who buy it than they realise themselves.
At the same time, however, we feel sure that Article 95 of the Treaty, covering the harmonisation of rules for the internal market, on which this draft is based, is an improper legal basis.
The purpose of the provisions that have been proposed is actually to protect public health, not to remove obstacles to the movement of products.
Article 152 of the Treaty, which refers to public health, authorises the Community to encourage cooperation between Member States, but under no circumstances to adopt binding harmonisation measures, as such, as these are expressly rules out by paragraph 3(c).
In such circumstances, we are well aware that the Commission, as is often the case, is currently using a praiseworthy cause - in this case, the anti-smoking campaign - in order to award itself new competencies, in spite of the wording of the Treaties and with no thought for subsidiarity.
We have therefore voted in favour of the amendments to show that ultimately, we wanted to take a hard line, but at the same time, we urge the Council to turn the draft directive, pursuant to Article 152, into a recommendation that will encourage Member States to face up to their responsibilities.
They are perfectly capable of doing so, and even if this national competence resulted in different consumer information rules in different countries, in line with their own culture, tobacco manufacturers would simply have to adapt to them.
Unless we take this kind of action, it could be said that subsidiarity no longer has any meaning within the Community.
Mr President, I am totally in favour of this report safeguarding citizens' health, the health of both active and passive smokers.
But when, in the past, have we ever succeeded in reducing tobacco consumption or cigarette smoking?
Only once, Mr President.
'And when was that?' you may ask.
In 1848, during the fight against the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in Milan.
In order to damage the Empire' s finances, the Milanese managed to reduce consumption of cigarettes.
There we are: we should have written, 'Smoking kills and governments are grateful for their saving in pension expenditure' .
Mr President, I voted against Amendment No 54 which would have allowed a derogation from our yield limits on cigarettes exported to third countries.
All cigarettes are harmful.
None do any good.
Smoking is an addiction, indeed a slow suicide, as we have voted, and manufacturers have admitted and known for some time that it causes cancer and other diseases.
I agree that third countries should set their own health rules but we should not approve of double standards.
If we choose tight protection for our citizens we should not allow the exporting of more dangerous products which profit from the addiction of others.
No man is an island.
All human beings are involved with each other.
I cannot condone profiting from the ill-health of third world citizens.
Mr President, I wanted to give an explanation of vote stating that I had abstained on much of the Maaten report.
Not because I do not share its health policy objectives, but because I really cannot understand why the Commission and this House wish to pass such detailed regulations at European level, since all they do is destroy our credibility.
When we start regulating the size, colour and position of notices and pictures on cigarette packets, then we are no longer the Europe in which I believe.
I disagree with Newton Dunn; it is not a question of double standards.
But we are responsible for the health of our citizens and we must decide on rules here.
Other regions must decide on their own regulations.
We cannot have rules which damage exports, with the result that others will then export to these regions.
I hope that we can reach agreements with the Council and the Commission here which contain clear, unequivocal health regulations, but not the sort of details which, in all conscience, we cannot decide in this House.
Mr President, this is just a brief statement to declare that I do not totally agree with the Maaten report either.
Although I am well aware that we have a duty to give consumers all the relevant information regarding the risks presented by the products they use, I do not feel that it is our duty to adopt prohibitionist laws, particularly where third countries are concerned.
The report contains excessive statements which are reminiscent of a certain type of terrorist propaganda which I do not feel would advance our awareness-raising operation, also because whenever we go to extremes in these sectors and these fields we obtain the opposite effects to those desired.
I would stress another point: I come from Italy, which is a Mediterranean country, and I would like to emphasise that the attempt to reduce subsidies for tobacco plantations is a very delicate issue.
I would ask the Commission to think again for thousands of jobs are directly or indirectly jeopardised.
There are a whole range of activities connected to the tobacco industry, which we must protect at all costs.
Mr President, I share this explanation of vote with Mrs Cauquil and Mrs Bordes.
In voting in favour of this report, despite its shortcomings and particularly despite the hypocrisy of Member States in their actions to limit smoking, we feel that we are making a stand, within the options available to us, against the right of tobacco cartels to poison the population for the sake of private profit.
The measures that are adopted should furthermore impose the same restrictions, at least on European tobacco companies, when they manufacture their products under licence, or sell their poison, in the countries of Eastern Europe, in Africa or elsewhere.
The behaviour of tobacco companies, which runs completely counter to the interests of society as a whole, mirrors the behaviour of all the large oil, asbestos, arms and agrifood companies, which are prepared to run the risk of harming the population or the environment in order to make a little more profit.
We rejected all of the amendments which sought to reduce the already very limited range of measures that have been proposed or to restrict information on the lethal effects of smoking, because they all serve the interests of the tobacco companies' lobby.
On the other hand, we support the employees in this sector, as well as small tobacco producers, whose income, as well as conversion to useful production, should be financed by levies on the enormous profits of the tobacco companies.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ban on any form of television advertising for cigarettes and other tobacco products in Directive 89/552 and the more stringent labelling requirements for tobacco products introduced in this directive illustrate the ambivalent attitude of the European Union towards tobacco.
On the one hand, tobacco crops are subsidised to the tune of over EUR 1 billion a year; on the other hand, we are trying to reduce the consumption of tobacco in the Union as much as possible.
This dilemma must be resolved in the interests of the credibility of Community policy.
The European Union must set itself the task of pursuing policies which our citizens can understand.
There is an irresolvable contradiction between the promotion of tobacco cultivation, on the one hand, and the advertising ban, on the other.
If this contradiction cannot be resolved at Community level, then the Union must fight to help attain a high level of health protection by supporting a reduction in tobacco cultivation at international level.
Mr President, I have voted decidedly in favour of the amended proposal and of the legislative resolution with regard to the new tobacco directive.
It is certainly the case that the texts need to be cleaned up because we have adopted quite a few texts which, according to the rules of lawmaking, do not belong in this directive at all.
Despite this, these texts too are of value because they send out a message.
They show that Parliament puts public health first.
Protecting public health is effectively our responsibility.
Even if we harmonise legislation, public health should not be compromised in any way.
Public health is not just any old interest, it is of general interest.
Today, we have proved that we stand for this, and that is how it should be.
Mr President, personally, I have never smoked and I am well aware of the dangers of smoking for the health of both the individual and of the public at large.
I am therefore against smoking.
Nevertheless, I voted against certain amendments that I would describe as excessive, and I abstained many times, because I feel that what we are witnessing here is a typical example of European over-regulation.
Some of my fellow Members clearly do not properly understand the legislator' s role.
A legislator can prohibit or authorise, but should not make sermons in legislative texts, which is what we do here all the time.
That kind of thing is fine for an explanatory statement, but not for legislative texts.
I come from a country where tobacco is not grown and I can therefore speak freely on the issue of producers.
I think that removing subsidies for tobacco producers will not stop smokers from smoking.
What it will do is open the door for tobacco imports from outside the European Community.
- It was important that the tobacco industry was not able to prevent the vote taking place in Parliament today.
More than half a million people died as a result of tobacco addiction in the EU in 1990.
Despite huge lobbying by the tobacco industry, including an attempt to say the process is illegal, the European Parliament will stand firm on public health.
I welcome the commitment to increase information in cigarette labelling.
Health warnings will take up 40% of the front of the packet and 50% of the back.
The industry must be made to give details of the ingredients of the cigarettes, including the tobacco, and just as importantly the filters and additives used to make them.
Each individual brand should list all additives, not just the prohibited ingredients.
This must be made public knowledge and not hidden behind a shroud of 'trade secrecy' .
People have a right to accurate information on the health risks of tobacco.
The Greens want to ban many of the more than 600 additives in cigarettes.
We need to know what these substances are and make sure that they are properly tested.
Smokers have a right to know exactly what a cigarette contains.
.
(FR) The fundamental purpose of the proposal for a Commission directive is to overhaul the current directives, specifically those that deal with the tar content in cigarettes and the labelling of tobacco products.
The proposal also seeks to complement current provisions by taking account of scientific progress and increasing the level of public health protection.
One of the merits of this directive is that it clarifies existing laws; it harmonises regulations between Member States, it improves consumer protection and supports the campaign against smoking.
I am in favour of this directive and I think that the obscene press campaign mounted by the tobacco multinationals is scandalous.
These companies care nothing for people' s health and are only concerned with their market share and their profits.
It is also essential that we adopt international measures to curb the offensive with which these companies are targeting developing countries, where they are stepping up advertising and propaganda campaigns, which are neither restricted nor monitored.
I am in favour of the Commission' s proposal, and also of the amendments tabled in the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which will improve public health protection.
Moreover, we should not deceive ourselves as to the problems we are facing, with the decision to threaten aid to Community tobacco production.
We must take the socio-economic aspects of this production into consideration.
We must also address these problems, undertake a process, and realise that the European Union imports almost 80% of the tobacco it consumes.
That is why I have co-signed an amendment, which calls for respect for Community preference in order to reduce the share of American multinational companies in tobacco consumption.
.
(EL) No one denies the harmful effects of smoking and no one can object to measures being taken to reduce smoking.
From this point of view, the Commission' s proposal for a directive contains positive provisions.
However, although there is serious doubt as to whether the Commission' s proposals will reduce consumption, they will undoubtedly have a decidedly adverse impact both on Community tobacco producers and on tobacco industries and merchants.
The amendments relating to a reduction in the consumption of tobacco products are no more than a pretext, the sole purpose of which is to reduce budgetary spending (approximately 1 billion euros a year, compared with total tax revenues in the 15 Member States of the EU from the tobacco sector of 60 billion euros a year) and, if adopted, will cause huge and irreparable social, political and financial damage to regional economies, especially in Greece.
Similarly, the abolition of the three-year derogation for the application of the directive proposed by the Commission and the application of the directive both to tobacco products consumed in the EU and to products for export to countries in which the strict provisions of the directive do not apply will cause Greece tremendous problems.
- I welcome the adoption of this report on the basis that it ensures the right to a higher level of public health protection and could potentially pave the way for the eventual eradication of tobacco addiction within the EU in the long term.
If we take the example of the Community's approach to food safety legislation, whereby legislation is based on the principle that consumers have the right to know what they are consuming, then the same principle must apply to tobacco products: smokers should have the right to know exactly what they are smoking and what the effects are.
We as legislators share the responsibility with the manufacturers of ensuring that the public is fully informed about the dangers of cigarette addiction.
The recommendations regarding warnings on the front of packages are to be welcomed because they shatter the myth that those products are less damaging to a person's health.
- (PT) The debate and vote on this report revealed a clear divide between Members.
We supported those proposals which, in order to protect the health of consumers, did not endanger jobs by preventing European farmers from continuing to produce tobacco and the European industry from continuing to manufacture it.
As imports are not being prohibited, the American multinationals would be the only ones to gain from a reduction in the production and manufacture of tobacco in Europe.
We therefore voted in favour of maintaining direct aid to income in the tobacco production sector within the European Union, thereby guaranteeing greater compliance with Community preference, in order to reduce the share of American multinationals in the tobacco consumption market and to protect the interests of Portuguese farmers, without public health being endangered.
We also tabled a proposal intended to protect the Portuguese brand 'Português Suave' as we consider that there is no reason to threaten this.
- I voted in favour of lifting the ban on sales of oral tobacco, so called snuff, in the EU.
I totally understand that all tobacco products are dangerous to human health and cause different types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
However, I think that all tobacco products, which may have different levels of harmfulness, should be treated in a way that is compatible with the level of danger they represent to human health.
I also want the different restrictions to be based on scientific facts.
That is why I tabled an amendment with my colleagues to do the monitoring of health effects by the year 2002 instead of 2005 which was the initial proposal from the Commission.
This proposal to change the timetable is also very important from the public health point of view.
Unfortunately my proposal was not adopted.
I still think that even if the scientific data come as late as the year 2004, this information will be very important for us Members of the European Parliament, when we create future legislation in the field of tobacco products.
- (DE) I was the rapporteur in this House for the common organisation of the raw tobacco market over 30 years ago.
In the enthusiasm of youth, I hoped then to convince my 141 fellow members not to introduce a market organisation for raw tobacco which would give us mountains of unmarketable raw tobacco to deal with.
Had I been listened to then, we would not now be crying over the billions spent on raw tobacco subsidies.
However, I am not trying here to come to terms with the past.
Things are as they are and we shall have to live with them, because tobacco farmers cannot reasonably be expected to be left standing out in the rain after 30 years' common organisation of the raw tobacco market.
We have got them used to subsidies and that has, to all intents and purposes, destroyed our chances of restructuring the cultivation of raw tobacco.
Now the health missionaries in the House want to stamp out the cultivation of raw tobacco in the European Union altogether; this will naturally benefit imported tobacco - which they cannot and do not want to stop - without, of course, making chain smokers give up smoking.
There is no question that a lot of people in the EU and everywhere else in the world die from lung cancer, which hits far more smokers than non-smokers.
But the sort of bans imposing unreasonable demands on the European tobacco industry which the Committee on the Environment has cobbled together with no regard for job losses, especially for women, will not make the citizens of the European Union give up smoking, as the current drastic measures in relation to advertising and labelling have already proven.
The suggestion that EU manufacturers should be required to comply with the same regulations as regards tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields for cigarettes intended for export to third countries is perverse in the extreme.
Wanting to accept a sense of responsibility for the health of smokers in third countries is obviously well meant, but when this sense of missionary purpose results in the tobacco industry relocating production intended for export to third countries outside the EU, then all we will have managed to achieve are job losses.
Measures such as this would result in the relocation of 12% of cigarette production in the tiny principality of Luxembourg alone.
What is being produced here now is out of proportion and unfair to tobacco farmers and discriminates against the European tobacco industry.
One cannot shake off the impression that certain people in the health lobby would prefer to exile smokers altogether.
I am in favour of warnings on packets, but not in favour of a skull which takes up 60% of the surface area.
I am in favour of a targeted information campaign, especially for young people, in order to make them aware of the dangers of smoking to their health.
But I am against all the exaggerations contained in this report and am therefore unable to vote in favour of the report as it stands.
- (SV) To impose a total ban on snuff in the EU, at the same time as cigarettes and other tobacco products are permitted throughout the Union, is illogical.
The ban on snuff, which applies in all EU countries except for Sweden, ought therefore to be lifted.
The advantage of snuff is that using it does not affect the environment.
While smoking causes suffering and illnesses even among people who do not smoke, especially among people with allergies, it is only the snuff taker himself who is exposed to possible ill effects.
Snuff is addictive.
The tobacco industry should not, therefore, be allowed to market snuff as something healthy.
The Marketing Directive, which will shortly be banning tobacco advertising within the EU, must be safeguarded and apply to all tobacco products.
.
EPLP Members fully support the main direction of the Maaten Report in highlighting health risks associated with tobacco.
However, we believe that there are a number of technical areas which will need to be clarified following first reading in negotiation with the Commission and Council.
The question of tobacco growing subsidy has not been addressed in this report.
Although many Members feel it is part of the whole debate on tobacco and health and should have been included here, we believe that it would be more correctly brought up in reform of the CAP.
.
(FR) Smoking kills: it causes 500 000 deaths every year in the European Union, which is 1400 a day or almost one a minute.
One smoker in two will die, sooner or later, from a smoking-related disease.
These figures speak for themselves and are terrifying.
Surely we need no further reason to support the proposed directive in its current form, quite rightly amended by our rapporteur, Mr Maaten, whom I must congratulate on his remarkable work, the broad outlines of which I have supported.
Tobacco is not just like any other product.
It requires specific regulation and it is most apt, in light of recent studies, that the Commission has proposed a revision of the legislative texts in this field.
Although it may seem naïve to try to eradicate smoking, I think that we can certainly reduce it considerably by providing the consumer with better information.
We have just declared ourselves in favour, much to my satisfaction, of warnings that will cover 35% of the front and 45% of the back of the cigarette packet.
Personally, I am sorry that most of my colleagues could not be convinced of the impact that photographs on these surfaces would have had.
I supported Amendment No 75 on banning the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 16.
To the anti-prohibitionists, who feel that this ban would, on the contrary, make cigarettes more attractive to young people, I would answer with an ethical argument.
Our society has the duty, in certain areas, to set strict moral limits.
It is the whole issue of human behaviour that is at stake here.
This also raises the whole issue of education and of health education in particular.
Such education must be started at the earliest possible age, and I think that adolescence is an appropriate stage to instil in young people the limits that they must not transgress.
On the basis of ethical considerations, too, I feel it is reasonable to ban exports of products that we consider to be harmful to our own citizens to countries outside the Union.
I voted in the strongest possible terms against Amendment No 54.
Europe has other assets and other creative ways of finding export markets.
During yesterday' s debate, some Members raised the point that smoking kills more people than tuberculosis, Aids or other infectious diseases.
This factor alone is sufficient reason for us to grasp this problem with both hands.
Mr Maaten' s report is a step in the right direction, but is only one step, because the fight for life, for health, is an ongoing struggle that should engage us all.
- (SV) The Swedish Christian Democrats have today voted in favour of significantly stricter rules for the tobacco industry, including the proposal that as much as 40 per cent of the space on packets of tobacco products should be taken up with health warnings, compared with the 25 per cent proposed by the Commission.
We are also in favour of no longer permitting any references to 'light' or 'milder' tobacco, as well as of phasing out subsidies for tobacco cultivation within the EU as soon as possible, for this form of subsidy is directly at variance with the EU' s efforts and initiatives to improve public health.
Moreover, we wish to abolish the peculiar tobacco derogation granted to Greece.
When it comes to the continued ban on sales of snuff to other EU countries, we Swedish Christian Democrats consider that account should be taken of the unwillingness of these countries to introduce a new product they consider to be habit-forming and destructive from a public health point of view.
Sweden ought not, in the name of free trade and the internal market, to force snuff products upon other countries and peoples if they do not want them.
In the same way, the Commission ought to have shown similar respect for Swedish alcohol policy by having extended and made permanent Sweden' s 1994 derogation concerning private imports of alcohol.
.
As Member for a tobacco-producing region, I would like to express my reservations about the proposal for a 'tobacco' directive.
Nobody questions the validity of its aims: smoking kills 500 000 people per year in the European Union alone.
We must therefore fight vigorously against smoking, just as we must fight unremittingly against drug addiction, alcoholism and all dangerous addictions, whether they are of natural or chemical origin.
In this respect, we can only share this report' s proposals, which seek more effectively to warn, make aware and inform consumers of the risks to which they are exposing themselves through excessive tobacco consumption.
Let us even go beyond labelling or limiting toxic substances by making better use than we currently do of the special fund established under the common organisation of the market for tobacco and to which producers pay contributions in order to fund the research and development of less harmful varieties.
On the other hand, however, let us be careful not to destabilise too suddenly, without allowing time to convert, a farming sector that involves 135 000 producers and employs 400 000 seasonal workers, in often very vulnerable agricultural regions.
In this case, there are a few basic principles which I feel must guide our action: we must act fairly against all factors likely to cause addiction, such as advertising and excessive consumption of dangerous pharmacological substances - funded, moreover, from the social security system -and we must ensure that restrictions on tobacco production within the Union are accompanied by the monitoring and restriction of imports so that their effects on consumption are not cancelled out.
We must give tobacco growers an adequate timescale in which to adapt their production to the new standards for tar content and we must reject any restriction on subsidies for tobacco production unless we replace them with aid as an incentive for conversion.
In other words, we must ensure that it is not only European Union producers - who supply only 25% of the raw tobacco consumed in Europe - who, without compensation or an adequate timescale, bear the costs of a regulation which is undeniably praiseworthy, but which is too sketchy in the form that has been proposed to us.
.
I wholeheartedly support amendments to the Commission's revised proposal on tobacco that will strengthen health warnings on cigarette packets in the EU.
The new cigarette health warnings will cover half the surface of cigarette packs, with warnings 40% of the packet size on the front and 50% on the back.
Smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that.
Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these, half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life.
As many as half a million people in Europe are killed by tobacco, and 85% of lung cancers are caused by smoking.
Madam President, I would have welcomed the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health, like they do in Canada.
If shocking pictures of smoke-filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking, go ahead and print them on packs.
I am disappointed it was not accepted.
It is preposterous that tobacco companies are trying to destroy this legislation.
I am fed up with them trying to put a stop to these proposals.
They have misled people for far too long.
At present, warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging.
Smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice.
The proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as 'ultra light' and 'low tar' .
People have been hooked on the idea that 'mild' and 'low tar' cigarettes are healthier.
This is simply not true.
Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes.
This legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives.
- (DE) I voted against an export ban on stronger cigarettes for the following reasons:
The Commission has proposed banning exports of cigarettes with yields of over 10 milligrammes of tar, 1 milligramme of nicotine and 10 milligrammes of carbon dioxide to third countries.
This would result in a massive erosion of EU cigarette exports and the loss of several tens of thousands of jobs.
This sort of ban benefits no one, because the cigarettes will simply be manufactured outside the EU.
But the jobs will be lost here.
The EU has absolutely no powers to enforce such a ban.
It has nothing to do with the internal single market.
The anti-tobacco fanatics should not act as if exporting cigarettes was tantamount to handing out cyanide.
The EU is acting inconsistently, given that it also subsidises the cultivation and export of tobacco to the tune of EUR 1 billion.
The EU is using an export ban to act as the health missionary of the entire world.
That is presumptuous and offends the customs and practices of other countries.
The right move would be to promote the work on global uniform production standards for tobacco products already begun in the World Health Organisation.
Unilateral action by the EU will be pointless.
Berenguer Fuster report (A5-0142/2000)
Mr President, I voted for this report on the exchange on information regarding, specifically, financial activities.
But I would like to accompany this vote with two questions: firstly, who inspects the inspectors, and secondly, why does the European Parliament not extend its controls - as I would advocate - to cover all the uses to which the citizens' money is put, including the money used to finance pension funds?
The Members of the Pensioners' Party are not yet aware of how the money from contributions which should boost their pensions is spent.
I feel that this directive should be extended to include this type of inspection.
Lulling report (A5-0144/2000)
Mr President, I voted for Mrs Lulling' s report on beer imports into Finland, but I have to say that I do not agree with these excise duties.
For my part, I would like there to be a free market.
I remember when, at the age of about 21, I worked as part of the crew of a ship which travelled between New York and the Bahamas: whenever I left the ship and ventured into New York City I was allowed to take two bottles of whisky with me, which, as I boarded the bus, would regularly be bought from me at three times the price, for whisky was much more expensive in New York.
Therefore, this trade between one State and another which was caused by different levels of duties was only natural.
If we want to avoid it, we must remove all the excise duties in the European Union.
The rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, strongly criticised the taxation of alcohol in Finland in her report, which she considers to be unreasonably high.
She also criticised the aim to restrict the importation of beer through derogation provisions.
In my opinion, the Commission' s proposal is a rather good compromise, however.
According to that proposal, Finland would reserve the right to abolish the more stringent restrictions on imports from EU countries in stages by the end of 2003.
Imports of beer from non-member countries such as Russia and Estonia would be limited to six litres up to the year 2006.
Nowhere else on the EU' s external borders is such cheap alcohol available than in those regions that border onto Finland.
In my opinion, Finland is consequently justified in maintaining more stringent restrictions on imports than other EU countries.
Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, Internal Market policy also has to take into account considerations of public health and environmental protection.
Derogations with regard to Community legislation must be allowed if they are made on the basis of higher levels of health protection.
- (SV) Finland has been hit by serious problems in the form of a drastic increase in the amount of beer imported from third countries, mainly from Estonia and Russia.
It is therefore a very positive development that the Commission is now granting Finland a six-year derogation to enable it to introduce a new limit on beer imports from third countries.
Finland is in that way being granted the right to limit beer imports from third countries to six litres per traveller per day up until 1 January 2006.
This issue shows that, in the case of Finland, the Commission realises that private individuals' being more or less free to import alcohol across national borders is not only a trade and tax issue.
More to the point, it has to do with public health and with a social policy on alcohol aimed at combating the horrors of abuse.
The Commission might have shown similar insight in its treatment of the Swedish derogations from 1994 concerning private imports of alcohol into Sweden.
While Finland is obtaining a new derogation, the Swedish one is being removed.
In this way, the Commission, together with the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Bolkestein, are drastically undermining the tools of alcohol policy, democratically decided by the Swedish parliament and government and consisting of high taxes and a restriction on imports.
Vidal-Quadras Roca report (A5-0159/2000)
Mr President, I have to say that I was very surprised to find myself voting for this report, for it represents, perhaps, the surrender of the European Union to one of the original Communities out of which it grew, namely Euratom: the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
I remember how, when I was a child, one of the books which I found most interesting and which I will never forget bore the title: 'My friend the atom' by Walt Disney.
This book explained clearly how our future would be improved by the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
Sadly, today, we have to come to terms with the fact that someone has prevented this from coming about.
And who was that?
We should send the multibillion pound bill for decommissioning the nuclear industry to the person responsible, although I still do not know who that is.
Maybe you can enlighten me, Mr President.
.
(FR) The purpose of the programme that we have been debating today is to organise the dismantling of the Joint Research Centre' s nuclear installations and the management of waste resulting from their nuclear activities.
I do not have any major disagreement with the basic proposal, but I do have questions about this programme' s budget, and the rapporteur has not provided us with any practical proposals on this.
It is true that he rejected the proposal by the European Commission.
Let us remember that the Commission proposed that it would finance this operation by using, at the end of each year, unspent appropriations from heading 3.
To this end, it would use a 'reception' line under the current sub-section B4, which covers energy, the monitoring of nuclear safety and the environment.
This solution may be satisfactory insofar as it places financing outside the framework programmes for research, a point stressed by the European Parliament, but it nevertheless falls short of what is required.
We cannot accept the long-term financing of the dismantling of nuclear activities through a 'miscellaneous' line, of an order which is left to chance.
I must take this opportunity to say that I do not approve of the growing frequency with which we resort to this type of line!
I imagine that this is what led the rapporteur to "take note" of the Commission' s proposal, without actually putting it into practice.
The report proposes that we establish a trialogue between the institutions in order to reach a solution but says nothing about the alternative means for financing that have been suggested.
The most mistaken course of action would therefore be to have the dismantling of these nuclear activities financed by Member States, by methods that still remain to be found.
That would inevitably cause a backlash in the countries that are not greatly affected by this problem.
On the other hand, the most suitable solution is the one that seeks to have this programme financed by a self-contained budget line.
I am quite aware that it is not the easiest solution, because it involves voting for additional appropriations in the review of the Financial Perspectives.
Nevertheless, we must provide ourselves with the means to achieve our ambitions, particularly when we are talking about nuclear activity.
In the long term, then, we will have to put pressure on the Council to accept the creation of this self-contained budget line.
In the shorter term, for pragmatic reasons, we should not obstruct the rapid implementation of this programme.
I therefore support the following compromise: in the very short term we set up the 'picking up the pieces' line proposed by the Commission, and initiate the trialogue promptly in order, in the medium term, to achieve a vote for an self-contained budget line.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)
Special UN conference: Women 2000
The next item is the Council and the Commission statements on the outcome of the special UN session on 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace' .
Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to tell you about the work carried out at the special UN conference assessing the 1995 Beijing Conference and its Action Platform.
The Beijing Conference was extremely important in terms of recognising women' s rights and approving an Action Platform endorsed by 189 countries.
It established the content of these rights and approved instruments allowing these rights to be gradually consolidated.
As usually happens with this type of international instrument, it became necessary to assess this given that five years had passed since it was signed.
This assessment was carried out over many sessions with preparatory meetings initially being held within a PropCom.
These sessions made slow and sometimes difficult progress in terms of agreeing on certain aspects on which one group of countries, particularly those which are usually regarded as the most developed, considered that progress should be made.
There were also some problems in terms of resistance to the language used, not in the political declaration which was approved earlier, but in the final document which was composed of four parts.
One of these parts concerned the measures and policies to be approved by governments in order to consolidate not only the Beijing Platform but also everything which has been achieved by the various countries in the meantime.
This process was relatively complex as alliances were established between certain countries, particularly from the European Union, and the South American countries with the result that the G77 broke up at a certain point.
This prevented the work from being carried out at a quicker pace.
Anyway, to summarise as quickly as possible, important progress was made in recognising women' s rights as human rights.
Very positive political statements were made in terms of rejecting any violations of these human rights, eradicating all practices which violate human rights, referring to the Commission on the Status of Women and the optional protocol and combating racism and violence based on racial grounds.
On the issue of violence against women, the satisfactory progress made included the agreement achieved on combating trafficking through international cooperation, with support for actions which are being developed at other levels in the international arena, and also the acceptance by all countries of public campaigns against violence based on the campaign instigated by the European Union on zero tolerance.
Also discussed were the issues of poverty eradication policies, work as a factor in ensuring the economic participation of women, the essential need to adopt policies reconciling family and professional life and the need to develop access for women to education and training as a basic instrument in guaranteeing them independence.
There was also, for the first time, a more positive reference to issues of maternity and paternity, usually associated with the male role, and the need for job-sharing.
On health, the need was noted for a holistic approach in terms of sexual rights and not just in the area of reproductive health.
Special references were introduced, also on the EU' s initiative, to handicapped migrant women, elderly women and native women.
The role of men was adequately emphasised, as also was the need to reinforce the participation of women in building increasingly peaceful societies.
Also addressed was the introduction of an issue which was one of the fundamental instruments in the Beijing Platform, namely mainstreaming from the gender perspective.
This must be included in all mechanisms on human rights, in the UN Treaties and at the Millennium Summit and represents an extremely important achievement.
As for the methodologies for assessing the progress made by countries in applying their commitments, positive references were also made to measurable and well-established objectives resulting in the type of monitoring which allows a more objective balance to be produced, at any time, than that achieved to date.
Discussions were also held on reinforcing the role of non-governmental organisations in conducting all the policies and as privileged partners of the State in ensuring that the Platform is implemented.
The basic problems concerned what the European Union has already included in Article 13 of the EC Treaty and the difficulty which some countries had in accepting the issue of sexual rights and its inherent diversity and the issue of sexual orientation.
In this context, and continuing the strategy defined at EU level of considering that this special conference was not a new conference but an intermediate phase, it was considered that, on these more delicate aspects, the language of Beijing should be used again.
The EU took the decision to make a final declaration in which it reaffirmed the progress achieved and its intention to continue fighting to ensure that what for us is already a commitment, given the very constitution of the European Union and specifically Article 13, can be enshrined in future instruments.
Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today to give you the Commission's view on the outcome of last week's extremely important conference in New York.
I want to apologise for the fact that my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, is unable to be here this afternoon.
As some of you will know, she was unavoidably delayed by commitments which she had undertaken before the timing of this debate.
As honourable Members will also know, she is coming to the committee next week in order to have a full exchange with Members, many of whom will, of course, have shared in the success achieved last week.
Members will be able to follow up any further details in that exchange with Commissioner Diamantopoulou next week.
I wish to begin, on behalf of the Commission, by thanking the Portuguese presidency for coordinating the Member States' positions so effectively and for handling the negotiations with other delegations so proficiently under what I understand were occasionally extremely difficult conditions.
We should also thank Parliament for its exceptionally cooperative approach to the special session.
Members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities made an extremely valuable contribution as part of the delegation.
However, beyond that, they took the initiative in cooperating with parliamentarians from the Member States and from associated countries.
That was an exceptionally useful piece of political coordination.
We in the Commission also very much welcome Parliament's motion for a resolution: it is a firm, constructive statement of Parliament's commitment to gender equality.
The European Union can be proud that it was the most progressive regional group represented at New York.
Collectively we fought hard to move forward from Beijing.
If we succeeded, it is due in part to the unity of purpose demonstrated by the various institutions.
And succeed, I think we can say, we certainly did!
In a number of areas the outcome document goes far beyond what was achieved five years ago at Beijing - a conference which I remember observing from slightly closer than would have been the case today.
We managed that without having to concede any watering down of the Beijing Platform in other areas.
The document reaffirms women's rights as human rights.
It urges all UN members to sign the CEDAW optional protocol and calls for a strong awareness of gender issues in the workings of the International Criminal Court.
It recognises that discrimination against women is often compounded by discrimination on other grounds.
While we did not obtain specific references to all the grounds listed in the EC Treaty, the presidency made the European Union position clear in a final statement before the General Assembly.
We have new, much clearer language on the state's duty to end violence against women, including domestic violence, and to put an end to the appalling yet growing traffic in women.
The outcome document acknowledges the link between gender equality and greater prosperity.
If women are given a chance to participate fully in social and economic life they will be better able to pull themselves and their communities out of poverty.
It seems to me, with some responsibilities in this field, inconceivable to have a sustainable model of economic development which does not have gender issues at its heart.
The document reaffirms the prime importance of education as a means of empowering girls and women.
It also refers to the need for a fair distribution of work between men and women, including work in the home, and for measures to make it easier to reconcile work with family care commitments.
It also has something to say on methodology - how, in other words, to ensure that these fine intentions are put into practice.
At the European Union's insistence the document recognises the importance of establishing benchmarks and progress indicators.
Lastly, we welcome the reference to men's role in bringing about greater gender equality for they clearly have a considerable responsibility as well.
The Union is better equipped than ever to deliver on its Beijing commitments with its stronger stand on human rights, gender equality and discrimination.
The Amsterdam Treaty gives the Union increased scope to push ahead with implementation of the Beijing platform for action.
I hope nobody will doubt the Commission's determination to do precisely that.
The effort is of course led by my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, but it is an endeavour in which all of us as Commissioners wish to be fully involved.
Mr President, I thank the Commission, the presidency and all my fellow delegates for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed and which has greatly impacted on the conference.
The conference has shown that, over the past couple of years, we have indeed made progress and we have done so in many areas.
For example, women are taking part in peace talks, improvement has been made in the field of women' s health problems, employment for women has improved in a number of countries and violence towards women has been put on the agenda in a number of countries.
As such, we can trace the progress that has been made, although new problems have emerged in the meantime, of course.
I am thinking of the problem of AIDS in women.
In some African towns and cities, up to 40% of pregnant women suffer from AIDS.
There is also the problem of trafficking in women, rape of women during armed conflicts, etc.
Consequently, Beijing +5 could not afford to just focus on the progress that was made in respect of decisions taken at Beijing.
Beijing +5 also had to incorporate a number of new issues into the text, which it did, after a hard fight.
In my opinion, we have three tasks within the European Union.
Firstly, as a European Union, we should remain the driving force behind the Member States.
We played this role very distinctly in the past and we must continue to do so in future.
It will be evident from the Fifth Action Programme and the financial resources used for this purpose whether the European Commission is serious about applying the Beijing Platform in years to come.
But it is not only vis-à-vis our own Member States that we have a role to play, we also have a responsibility towards the candidate countries, those which we as MEPs have brought together in New York.
We have proposed to continue the cooperation with them and asked the Commission, during the screening activities it carries out in the context of the acquis communautaire, to assess the achievements with regard to the Beijing Platform too.
We also have a role to play vis-à-vis third countries.
It is dreadful to have to listen to the problems which women face in third countries: genital mutilation, killing if they have been unfaithful or if they had sexual relations before marriage and all these kinds of problems.
It is the most atrocious form of violence perpetrated against women.
In my opinion, the aid which the European Union grants to third countries should definitely be conditional on what these third countries need to do in order to solve the problems faced by women.
Finally, I would like to make it clear that I am a Catholic, but an open-minded Catholic.
I was greatly shocked by the news that the Church which I belong to has associated itself with the most fundamentalist groups which exist in society.
It was shocking, mainly because my Church offers so few opportunities to women within its own structures.
Mr President, the European Union brought women' s rights throughout the world to the fore in New York.
They were tough negotiations, which is why the Portuguese Presidency deserves special thanks for speaking not only on behalf of the 15 Member States, but also on behalf of the associated countries, with the exception of Poland, as do the Commission and the Commissioner and her negotiators, who worked together with the Parliament delegation in an exemplary manner.
That is most unusual, so here too special thanks.
And fruitful collaboration with non-governmental organisations also strengthened the position of the European Union.
Our unity allowed our opinion to prevail in the progressive countries and to make significant progress in the twelve crucial areas.
At no time did the European Union brook any watering down of the Beijing action platform, although it is, of course, a pity here that we did not have a resounding success on every count and that the clear language in Article 13 on non-discrimination and sexual rights is not reproduced in the outcome document from New York.
As already mentioned, we have the fundamentalist countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and even the Vatican to thank for that.
But this should not blind us to the fact that we really moved forward with women' s rights in New York and made significant progress in the areas already mentioned.
We now have specific measures in place in many countries to combat the cruel practice of genital mutilation, the issue of HIV/AIDS was addressed and the role of women in the peace process, ignored hitherto, was recognised as an issue.
The fight against violence was put on every country' s agenda.
Access to capital, the role of men - very important, we would like to see more men taking part in the process - still need to be promoted.
We tabled our document, our report, in New York as an official UN document, another major success.
I think the resolutions of Parliament and our progress in the European Union, Parliament' s progress, are now accessible to every country.
We were very successful with the initiative to invite parliamentarians twice and have speeded up the implementation of the action platform.
We came to the clear conclusion with our partners from associated countries that we need to work together more closely in order to promote women' s rights.
We want to have a parliamentarians' conference in two years to review Beijing.
We insist on another world women' s conference in five years to ensure that the process continues.
We must all make a joint effort to ensure that the subject of gender mainstreaming, equal opportunities for men and women, stars on the world political agenda.
It is in our interest to fight for this.
I think, and this is my personal opinion, that it is also in our interest to fight to ensure that this happens in Eastern Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by saying that I am pleased with the outcome of the Special UN Conference on 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace' .
In my opinion, all credit for this follow-on from Beijing +5, where the implementation of the action plans was discussed, should go to the NGOs, but also to the European Parliament, which was represented by five strong women, and naturally the European Commission, which, in the form of Mrs Diamontopoulou, was 100% committed to this conference.
Progress has been made, that is for sure, as has already been mentioned by previous speakers.
The distribution in care, actions against trafficking in women and empowerment of women are important issues to me.
I am pleased that the participating countries still subscribe to the Beijing Declaration and the action plan.
It is nonetheless unfortunate that only eight countries in the world have managed to meet the essential obligations which follow on from these with regard to equality in education, paid work and a minimum representation of 30% in national parliaments.
It naturally gives me pleasure to be able to say that the Netherlands is one of them, although I am not entirely satisfied with its emancipation policy, or rather, the lack of it, and that Germany, the Scandinavian countries and South Africa too belong to the eight.
But back to Europe.
In my opinion, it is downright alarming that it is precisely the candidate countries which have shown a decline in the number of female employees and the number of girls registered in education.
This development merits particular attention from us in the European Parliament.
Not only is education the best way to obtain gender equality, it is also the quickest way and the only way if we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren will not still be grappling with these issues.
We should point out to the acceding countries that they need to improve this situation.
The other point I wanted to raise is the opposition from the Islamic and Asian countries with regard to women' s rights, in connection with which they refer to the sharia.
I find it downright disgraceful that we women cannot join forces across the world.
I would ask you to give attention to this.
It is not just the Islamic and Asian countries to which this applies, but also Poland, for example.
Finally, I would like to ask you, as I do not have any hard facts at my disposal regarding the acceding countries, whether it would be possible to analyse the status quo in the candidate countries, ideally as soon as possible so that we can assess whether the situation there has improved.
Finally, I would call for the NGOs, in particular, to be given a key role, because it is they who are promoting awareness, and this is something which needs to be done not only among women, but also among men.
They need to be involved in this process.
At the end of the day, we are relying on the political will of society as a whole to commit itself to a cause which is related to democracy and human rights and which transcends all cultures and religions.
Mr President, I am not now asking for an extra minute in the name of equality, however;
I shall try to keep to two minutes.
I will join that group of people who just said that real progress was made on many issues at the New York Conference.
Women' s human rights, the trade in women, violence against women, women' s economic rights, the status of civil society: we may be pleased about the progress that has been made in all these issues.
It is the very determined work of the European Union we have to thank for that.
We were there as observers, but it is to be hoped that we were also able to influence the way the talks went - at least in some respect.
It was especially gratifying for me that all the Member States and almost all the candidate countries were talking together under Portugal' s leadership.
This is a promising sign that we will also be able to strengthen legislation on equality within the context of the European Union.
I myself do not remember seeing such single-mindedness, and for that thanks go to the chairman and, obviously, the Commission as well.
The only exception among the candidate countries was Poland, which was not at all interested in supporting the strengthening of women' s rights in the same way as the Member States of the European Union and the other candidate countries.
I would appeal to Commissioner Patten that when enlargement negotiations are being conducted, serious attention be paid to Poland' s compliance with EU legislation on equality and its recognition of women' s rights.
I also think that greater attention must be paid to women' s rights in connection with the cooperation that is going on with Mediterranean countries, as it is there that glaring violations of human rights, particularly in respect of women, take place.
I believe this conference has given hope to all those millions of women who are without fundamental human rights; and we need a further follow-up conference in five years' time.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Presidency.
I did not participate directly in the New York conference, but the reports I have heard, from participants and in other ways, have really praised the European Union as being very much a motor of progressive change.
I think that, happily enough, we can declare the Beijing platform for action a success.
If there is anything which really has had a very secure foundation, it is very much this platform that has been adopted.
We saw this from the assessment, showing a host of committed women around the world working not only on a small scale but also on an extremely large scale where, for example, violence against women is concerned.
I should also like to thank Mrs Smet.
I do not belong to any church and come from a country which has now also separated the Church from the State.
I want to thank all practising Catholics who are dissociating themselves from the Vatican State, which is behaving as it is.
If we cannot enter into dialogue with the Vatican State in the future, we shall probably have to question its basis for existence.
Mr President, I would like to begin my speech by turning to the benches of this Parliament and urging certain Members to feel concerned at the lack of attention that our male colleagues pay to women' s rights in this Chamber, in which there are 30 women for 5 men.
I wonder if, bearing this figure in mind, we really had the right to lecture people in New York and to advocate women' s rights in such a vigorous way.
After this introduction, with which I am sure almost everyone will agree, I shall say a few things that certain Members present will be less pleased to hear.
I think that there were two problems inherent in the debates in New York: one of content and one of form.
For a Union delegation to experience only two problems is quite reasonable, but they are crucial ones.
The first concerns the tendency of delegations to speak on behalf of our Parliament.
It should be pointed out that one does not speak on behalf of a legislative Assembly, but on behalf of an executive!
In fact, the legislative body can express its will only through its votes and no delegate from our Assembly has the right to speak on its behalf: they are only entitled to speak on their own behalf and they are only delegates from the point of view of protocol.
This playing to the Assembly' s gallery was expressed in New York by an extremist minority, which is trying to impose a Malthusian policy.
A palpable threat was made by our so-called representatives towards Poland, a free and sovereign country.
This threat also involved insults being made.
The threat lay in the fact that, as was pointed out just now, it was suggested to the Polish Minister that, if he did not accept the will of the so-called delegates of the European Parliament, Poland' s membership process would be slowed down.
You can imagine that, for a country such as Poland, this pressure to align itself, imposed by the forces of the Amsterdam pact, presents a terrible image.
The insult lay in the fact that the Polish Minister was compared to an Ayatollah, simply because he was advocating family values and refused to accept a Malthusian policy.
To conclude, Mr President, let us point out once again that joining the European Union is conditional upon compliance with the Treaty criteria and on the assent of Parliament, not the personal whims of some of its Members.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the Assembly of the United Nations has once again offered an opportunity to demonstrate the progress made since the Beijing Conference, as well as the problems which remain and which need to be resolved.
Education is still the most effective instrument for ensuring that women can freely exercise their rights and for allowing greater access to positions of responsibility, both in the workplace and in public life.
Knowledge of new technologies has been considered to be of great importance in terms of allowing full participation in the society of the future.
The media is of enormous importance as it can allow women' s voices to be heard, and can transmit an image, without stereotypes, which is committed to society and the quest for solutions to everyday problems.
Women' s health is one of the priorities of the meeting' s final document, with special mention of the spread of Aids, especially in certain areas of the planet, which affects women in a particular way and requires special measures for prevention and treatment.
One of the objectives is the eradication of domestic violence, which will be considered as a public issue and therefore subject to national legislation.
Violence against women and girls will be punishable by law, which means that there will have to be legislative reforms in the countries where it is not yet considered a crime.
Poverty particularly affecting women must be eradicated, and this is why the countries which have signed the agreement will send 0.7% of their GDP to development programmes aimed at eliminating what has come to be called the feminisation of poverty.
Globalisation has generated new problems which particularly affect women, such as trafficking in human beings, prostitution and drug-trafficking, which should be combated so that women may live a dignified and free life in conditions of equality.
All these objectives must be achieved in the next few years and, in order to ensure they are complied with, we are requesting a new meeting within the next five years.
The fifth programme for equality promoted by the European Commission must serve to promote the position of women, to eliminate the remaining inequalities, integrating gender policies into all Community programmes.
This meeting has therefore been of enormous importance in terms of making progress in the situation of women in all parts of the world.
The European Union' s position, given that it has a higher level of development and, therefore, better conditions for women, must not allow us to forget the situation of women in other areas, where daily hardships are combined with malnutrition, extreme poverty and a complete lack of respect for their fundamental rights.
Mr President, I want to thank the Council of Ministers and the Commission for their respective interventions.
The Women' s Conference at the UN in New York came perilously close to failing.
A small group of Catholic and Islamic fundamentalist countries clearly intended to undermine the progress achieved by women from around the world in Beijing five years ago.
The issues which created the most problems were women' s rights to sex education, free abortion and safe sex in order to protect themselves against HIV and AIDS.
These issues united certain Islamic and Catholic countries ranging all the way from the Sudan, Iran and Libya to the Vatican, Nicaragua and Poland, which were prime movers in the fight against these rights.
Some countries attempted to quash wordings about governments' responsibility to protect women from various forms of violence.
In spite of the fact that, last week, we were in danger of turning the clock back, we eventually agreed upon a final document which looks ahead to progress on the basis of the Women' s Conference in Beijing and, at the same time, marks out the route towards increased equality in the future.
I should like to point out that the Presidency of the EU, especially the minister Mrs De Belém Roseira, actively contributed to a successful final outcome, something we would thank her for.
The final document embodies progress in certain respects.
Forced marriages and murders committed for reasons of honour are mentioned for the first time in an agreed international document.
On the issues of rape within marriage, right of possession and right of inheritance, together with the right to asylum on the grounds of gender-based persecution, the wordings have been strengthened.
Women' s right to equal participation in macro-economic decision-making, together with the allocation of quotas with a view to increasing women' s participation in political parties and parliaments are other matters which are being taken up.
The resolution we are to vote on demands that the institutions of the EU, Member States and candidate States make active efforts to turn the final document from Beijing +5 into a reality.
It is especially important that all candidate States, including Poland, undertake to abide by the EU' s policy on women' s rights.
What are now required are economic resources for putting the decisions into effect and inspection tools for supervising their implementation.
Mr President, the Beijing +5 Conference has not actually made any significant progress in achieving the aims defined in the Beijing 1995 action programme.
The women' s march for equal opportunities and the affirmation of differences still has a long way to go and is effectively full of dangerous paths.
This became clear in New York when Islamic fundamentalists attacked what, in recent years, has characterised women' s demands: an end to domestic rape and violence, an end to the right for men to commit crimes passionnelles and an end to female circumcision.
However, it must, of course, be appreciated - as Commissioner Patten said, moreover - that the Conference as a whole confirmed and consolidated women' s rights as human rights.
However, similar positions on sexual rights, sexual health and the self-determination of women have caused an unholy alliance - evident at Beijing - to be formed between Christian and Islamic fundamentalists, including the Vatican, Poland, Nicaragua and a number of Islamic countries.
Furthermore, I feel that mainstreaming and empowerment were consolidated in this Conference, and also the fight against poverty and trafficking in human beings, but that there was an absence of tangible, verifiable objectives such as the need for a greater representation of women in the institutions and also for projects to fight poverty.
I welcome the positive contribution made by Europe to forging closer relationships with other countries and the NGOs.
Mr President, the very positive assessment that we are making today of the meeting in New York, should not allow us to forget that there have been serious deficiencies and great hypocrisy, even within the European Union, which make me want to double my efforts from now on.
An example of this, and this is an appeal to the Council, is the issue of wage discrimination.
It has been demonstrated that, compared to men doing the same work, women receive 50 or up to 80 per cent less.
This is not in our legislation.
Nevertheless, it appears that the European Union approves of it.
I wonder if the Portuguese Presidency, before the end of its mandate, could make a recommendation in this respect.
It also seemed extremely important to me, Mr Patten, that in the meeting in New York, when the policy of microcredits was discussed - loans to certain women so that they may be given access to financial autonomy - the countries recognised that these programmes of microcredits had been a complete success.
Why does the Commission and the European Union, given such a positive assessment, not implement these programmes so that the European Union may also offer its women with no resources the possibility of these policies?
Please answer me, Mr Patten.
Mr President, the European Parliament' s delegation played a magnificent role with regard to the candidate countries.
Our work has been outstanding in this respect.
I do have reservations with regard to Poland, but precisely because Parliament' s delegation played such a significant role.
Mr Varaut, you are very badly informed.
You have made a fool of yourself.
You were not in New York, but I was.
Your information is not accurate.
It is not even true.
Your intervention is very unfortunate because it is false.
I have to refute what you have said because none of it is true.
Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency, in particular Minister Maria de Belém, and the Commission, represented by Commissioner Diamantopoulou, for their guidance and coordination work both at the preparatory stage and during the Conference, for this allowed the European Union to make a substantial contribution to the production of the final document.
It has already been said many times: the work carried out by the UN and in New York has demonstrated clearly that some progress has been made since Beijing.
Women are no longer regarded as merely vulnerable people who need to be protected but as the social protagonists of change and as an essential part of society' s resources.
The need to continue the fight against all forms of discrimination on grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, age, disability and sexual orientation, which are still rife throughout the world, has become clear.
The need has become clear for governments to include a gender aspect in all government policies, from employment to development, from social policies to the fight against violence.
There is an evident need to continue to step up dialogue and cooperation with autonomous women' s organisations in civil society, politics and the institutions.
A number of challenges remain at national and international levels and for the European Union, particularly in the context of its development cooperation policy.
In this regard, I would like to draw Commissioner Patten' s attention to the Commission' s frequently negligent attitude towards the adoption of drafts which provide for the involvement of women on development cooperation with Mediterranean countries.
Poverty affects women more than anybody else.
Therefore, we need to focus on clear policies which fight the social exclusion of women and consolidate their role as active protagonists of political change and economic development.
If globalisation is to provide new opportunities, it must include globalisation of the human rights of all people, globalisation of fairness and globalisation of equal opportunities.
Development must be regarded as a project to expand the freedoms which all human beings have the right to enjoy.
Therefore, the need for recognition of rights without any discrimination must be a priority both for us and for the international organisations.
Mr President, the World Conference on Women, which was held five years ago, meant a breakthrough at the time in the worldwide recognition of women' s rights as an area of human rights autonomy and empowerment.
In contrast to this, I have mixed feelings about the UN Conference which was held in New York last week.
On the one hand, it was confirmed that it is up to governments to guarantee equal rights for women and to pursue sound emancipation policy, and, despite many people' s fears, no retrograde steps were taken.
On the other hand, it was once again impossible to reach agreement on sensitive issues which had not been resolved at Beijing, such as the recognition of the right to self-determination for women in their personal life, including their free choice in pregnancy and sexual behaviour or sexual preference.
This is greatly disappointing.
Actual equality and freedom for women is only possible if all options are open to them and if the traditional family image is not held up to them as the only true one.
Resistance of the kind displayed by governments, diplomats and officials last week, is a form of rearguard action, however.
It is impossible to stop a revolution with clever word games and little schemes behind the scenes.
The fight goes on.
The true inspiration which I gained from last week' s conference in New York lay in the power of the international women' s movement which, contrary to popular belief, is as vigorous and alive as ever and is also bolstered by a new generation of young women who, strong and well-informed, stand up for all kinds of issues.
The European Union and Member State representatives showed great commitment during the Conference to the issue of sexual self-determination for women and the non-discrimination principle pursuant to Article 13.
The fact that this did not end up in the final document should not be a reflection on them.
What can, however, be expected of the Council and Commission, is that they put their money where their mouths are in their respective Chambers.
In addition to what we obtained last week, namely reparative legislation on equality in work and professional life, they should produce new additional legislation to prevent sex discrimination across the entire range of social life.
Article 13 offers the opportunity to do so and the Beijing +5 Conference issued an instruction to this effect.
Surely a European Union which, at international conferences, is full of rhetoric on banishing sex discrimination should set about developing effective policy instruments which can attain this goal at the level of the Union itself.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Many friends and women who are colleagues in this Parliament have just pointed out that my name appears as one of those who signed against women's rights.
I want to put on record that I am not against women's rights.
I have always supported women's rights.
It must be an error.
Sometimes colleagues bring petitions from delegations and we sign them.
I am sorry about that.
That was not a point of order, Mr Khanbhai.
You mentioned a matter which has not been raised by anyone.
There has been no reference during the debate either to your name or to a list of reprobates.
I really do not know what you are talking about.
President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you will understand the pride I feel as a Portuguese national at the general acclaim for the Portuguese Presidency' s excellent work in promoting equal rights for women during its term and particularly with regard to the special UN conference on Beijing+5.
The conferences on violence against women, trafficking of women and reconciling family and professional life, together with the UN conference on Beijing+5, are clear examples of the Portuguese Presidency' s involvement in this area.
Anyone at the UN last week, like myself, would know that, in the end, we only managed to approve less than one-third of the final document.
The difficulties were immense.
I feel that it was both the work of the Presidency and the Commission and the involvement of all the female Members of this House who were there, and who joined with the national MPs of the Fifteen plus those from the applicant countries with the exception of Poland, which ensured that progress was made in the final document and that this was a lot closer to our intentions than when we started the work.
Finally, I must say that the European Union has a decisive role to play in this issue.
We must lead the way in defending women' s rights and we must continue the work in this respect.
The resolution approved by the European Parliament was greatly appreciated in the UN.
I must thank the President-in-Office for having come directly from Canada to Strasbourg so as not to miss this meeting which is so important to us.
I know that, since Monday of last week, she has been constantly dealing with women' s issues both in the USA and in Canada.
Mr President, I must thank the Members for all their compliments on the Presidency' s work.
I must also say very sincerely and with immense gratitude that the conduct of this work in this way was only possible because we all - the Presidency, the Commission, the European Parliament and the non-governmental organisations - cooperated together.
This was also possible because the bilateral contacts which we each maintain, by working hard at them and thereby multiplying their effectiveness, were vital in the end result.
I am extremely grateful to everyone for this.
When I spoke, it was clearly on behalf of all the Member States of the European Union and of all the applicant countries except for Poland.
In the contacts established with Poland, it has been made very clear that accession cannot be exchanged for non-recognition of women' s rights.
The European Union could not take any other position on such an issue.
Women will no longer accept their fundamental rights being regarded as a bargaining chip for political issues.
Europe must continue to be the driving force in developments in this area.
These must be achieved through cooperation, particularly with all like-minded countries, some of which, like Canada, are totally committed to the Presidency' s statement presented at the end of the special conference.
We must take advantage of all these opportunities.
These developments must also be achieved through benchmarking processes and by using the conclusions of the Lisbon Special Summit, which considered that in Europe there could be no economic development without social cohesion.
In this way the European Union itself can develop and export these instruments for assessing, measuring and exchanging good practices enabling gradual and effective progress to be made.
I referred to the Portuguese Presidency' s work on the issue of discrimination in the European Union.
Portugal is also very pleased that, in the last Social Affairs and Employment Council, a resolution was approved on reconciling family and professional life.
Women are constantly being penalised because the time that they devote to family life gives employers objective reasons to discriminate against them in wage terms.
Therefore, in my opinion, we have already achieved what was asked of us.
Finally, I must thank the President and the whole House for your kindness and the comments which you have made, and I also thank the Commission for its support.
The Portuguese Presidency is now coming to an end and sincerely hopes that the subsequent French and Swedish Presidencies will continue the work which we have together managed to achieve so that they represent the next stage in the consolidation of women' s rights.
Thank you, President of the Council.
We all share this hope.
The debate is closed.
I have received four motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, following the intervention by my colleague in seat No 662, here, in Parliament, I have asked for the floor on a point of order because this fellow Member has obviously fallen victim to misinformation or to a misunderstanding.
In fact, the Members of the European Parliament who were in New York as part of the European Union delegation, which comprised 15 people with observer status, were not allowed to speak because, in accordance with the UN' s procedure for extraordinary general assemblies, the Portuguese Presidency spoke on behalf of the European Union.
The Commissioner was entitled to give a speech in the plenary session.
Even in the working parties, we were not allowed to take the floor, which was always given to the Portuguese Presidency.
Do not, therefore, put words into the mouths of the Members of this Parliament who were in New York.
In no instance did we speak in an official capacity, still less on behalf of this Parliament, although we did have some useful discussions with the Commission and the Council, with Members of the Parliaments of Member States and associated States, who allowed us to convey our views.
What were banned from these meetings were the positions that Parliament adopted under the Smet/Gröner report, and nothing else.
Mr President, Poland' s name has been bandied about a great deal, so I must say that we simply stated that Poland is accepting the acquis communautaire.
If Poland tells us that it is free...
(The President cut the speaker off) I do wish to point out that a fellow Member has accused us, Mr President, and I must be entitled to correct this, otherwise this is not a genuine Parliament.
You may hear my explanation of vote tomorrow, Mr President, if you are going to cut me off.
Mrs Lulling, we have already heard speeches on the matter from the President of the Council and from the Commissioner on the subject of Poland.
You were speaking about a point of order.
Mr Izquierdo Rojo had already replied to Mr Varaut and therefore, Mrs Lulling, you could not use your speech on a point of order to discuss the issue.
You have, of course, prompted Mr Varaut to ask to take the floor for personal reasons.
You are quite right, Mr President.
In short, I agree completely with the need for a full debate in this Chamber, even if we do not all agree.
Next, having heard what most of the speakers said on the issue of Poland, I am left in no doubt as to many of the things said in corridors and about the pressure of which I was informed, which was brought to bear on the representatives of Poland, a free State.
To conclude, I have heard many things said about the Vatican, but I can see that Jesuitical thinking, at least, has truly pervaded the European Parliament.
Mr Varaut, we cannot base our debates on corridor conversations.
These are not reliable sources of information and are not available simultaneously to all Members in all languages.
The corridors are there specifically for private, informal conversations, not official debates.
Tunisia - Human rights - EU-Tunisia Agreement
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:
(B5-0477/00) by Mr Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, to the Council, on the human rights situation in Tunisia;
(B5-0478/00) by Mr Schori and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, to the Council, and (B5-0479/00) to the Commission, on Tunisia;
(B5-0480/00) by Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, to the Council, and (B5-0481/00) to the Commission, on the EU-Tunisia Agreement;
(B5-0482/00) by Mrs Flautre and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, to the Council, and (B5-0483/00) to the Commission, on relations between the EU and Tunisia;
(B5-0484/00) by Mr Dupuis and Mr Turco, on behalf of the TDI Group, to the Council, and (B5-0485/00) to the Commission, on the situation in Tunisia;
(B5-486/00) by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the UEN Group, to the Council, on relations between the European Union and Tunisia;
(B5-0530/00) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and Mr Hernández Mollar, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, to the Council, and (B5-0531/00) to the Commission, on Tunisia.
Mr President, I should like first of all to welcome Moncef Marzouhi, spokesman for the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, and Khemmaïs Ksila, from the Tunisian League for Human Rights, who are present in this Chamber.
Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I, together with other Members of this Parliament, have spared no effort to ensure that this debate was held.
Why should we discuss Tunisia?
This is not a question of interference, as that country' s future is in the hands of its citizens.
What we wish to do is open people' s eyes to the hidden reality of Tunisia and to shoulder the responsibilities that are incumbent on the European Union, which is linked to that country by an association agreement that was signed five years ago now.
The hunger strike by the journalist Taoufik Ben Brik lifted a corner of the veil that conceals the lack of press freedom and the persecution of the men and women with alternative views to those of the regime of President Ben Ali.
No, Tunisia is not the smiling land trumpeted in the advertisements aimed at the 4 million European tourists who go there every year.
Tunisia also comprises militants fighting for human rights, women fighting for democracy, students who are spied on, harassed, and deprived of their telephones, passports, sometimes even of the freedom to travel within Tunisian territory.
An administrative action, which, on the face of it, is quite commonplace, becomes a genuine political fight.
This is what happens, for example, to the militants of RAID, the Tunisian branch of the ATTAC movement - the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens - whose association is not allowed to exist, and three of whose members have been held in prison.
Tunisia has also become a judicial system that is controlled from above.
Militants are imprisoned and tortured.
I still remember the suffering endured by young Nourredine, whom I met when four of us visited Tunis a month ago.
Nourredine was tortured and kept in prison for more than 20 months simply for having organised a strike at the university.
Fortunately, in the last few weeks, several prisoners have been released and passports have been returned.
In short, I would like to see the Tunisian authorities express the will to take account of the calls for democracy.
If measurable progress is to be made, however, more must be done, much more.
Hundreds of prisoners of conscience, who are locked up in intolerable conditions, must be released.
Organisations that are not recognised, such as the RAID and the TNLF, must be decriminalised, and the cases against the three leaders of the RAID, whose trial will be held on 27 June, must be dropped.
Let us therefore not weaken in our support for those who are taking action to condemn a police state.
The desire for freedom has, moreover, become so unbearable to some parties that they, sometimes with violence, try to prevent public meetings about freedom in Tunisia, even in France.
I witnessed this myself around a week ago in Paris.
Such acts within the European Union itself are quite unacceptable.
We must therefore point out that the association agreement, which contains a clause on respecting human rights, the non-observance of which can lead to suspension, is not being respected today.
I urge all honourable Members to vote in favour of the compromise resolution and I particularly urge the Council and the Commission to implement all the methods provided for in the agreement to ensure that democratic freedoms are respected, by involving civil society and preparing if needs be, for this agreement to be suspended.
To conclude, the economic policy set by the Tunisian government, which gives liberal experts the impression that it is a model student, is under threat from various social forces.
The partnership proposed by the European Union, which is essentially based on free trade, is liable to exacerbate the harmful effects on the population to the extent that, as the parliamentary delegation for relations with the Maghreb noted, the association agreement is considered to be harmful by all Tunisian organisations, in both the public and the private sectors.
I therefore urge the Commission to review the European Union' s Mediterranean policy in the light of its economic and social consequences for the Tunisian economy and for employment there.
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Da Costa, we are approaching this debate, as we approached the questions we put to the Council and the Commission, aware of the responsibility entailed in our partnership relationship with Tunisia, which we consider will be decisive for the success of the entire Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
In fact, Tunisia is the first country with which the European Union signed an Association Agreement within the context of the 1995 Barcelona Process.
We attach great importance to preserving and consolidating this Agreement, and I would like to make it quite clear that, as far as we are concerned, there is no question about this.
On the other hand, it is true that we are following the development of the situation in Tunisia closely and with a sense of involvement, and we appreciate the positive factors such as economic and social progress, which we do not deny, particularly in relation to the region' s situation and the role played by Tunisia in the Arab Maghreb.
We do not, therefore, intend to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country at all, and it will be more useful if today' s debate serves to bring about renewed commitment on both sides to the values and undertakings entailed in our partnership.
However, in all honesty, I must also say that we are extremely concerned about the human rights situation in this country, particularly because we are convinced that, given the socio-economic and cultural context involved, there is the possibility for substantial improvement in the degree of freedom of the press, of speech, of association and of movement, conditions in prisons and the autonomous exercising of justice, so that the country can move towards full expression of the rule of law.
And this is the moment to do so.
This is why we call upon the Commission and the Council to support this process by joining us in making representations to the Tunisian authorities.
We must not forget that the creation of a free trade area is not the sole objective of the partnership policy, nor, moreover, that the partnership does not just consist of an exclusive relationship between the governments but has to ensure support and due respect for civil society, for the autonomous associations which uphold human rights and freedoms and for the role of women, whose lives in this country are full of sacrifices and who are often at great risk and undergo indescribable suffering.
For our part, we must prove that the Euro-Mediterranean policy is a priority for the Union as a whole and that it is not based on the egotism of those of us who are motivated by the desire to conquer new markets for our goods or obtain cheap labour for our businesses.
It is also based on shared values, on respect for cultural, religious and linguistic differences, and on policies capable of producing prosperity and security for the entire Mediterranean area.
Today, may this debate serve to remind us and our partners of all these things.
Why is Europe silent about human rights in Tunisia?
Is it on account of the stability and economic progress which this holiday destination enjoys?
Is it because of the political links with France or the European socialists?
Or because it has adopted a constructive stance in the peace process in the Middle East?
Or do we see Tunisia mainly as a bulwark against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism?
At any rate, President Ali only has the religious fanatics in mind.
He seems to be obsessed by them.
But this concern is more of an alibi than a justification for the human rights situation in his country.
Not only Muslim fundamentalists, but all political opponents are systematically silenced.
Tunisia calls itself a democracy, a democracy without opposition that is, without freedom of the press, without fair judicial processes and with torture and the elimination of political prisoners and their families.
Tunisia has concluded an association agreement with the European Union which contains a clear human rights clause.
There can, of course, be no question of President Ben Ali' s claiming rights under the agreement but shirking his obligations under it.
If the violations continue, the Treaty will unfortunately need to be suspended.
Would Commissioner Patten agree with me there?
Tunisia is the first Mediterranean Sea partner with which this association agreement has been concluded.
Given its economic development, it can act as a model for the entire region, but it should then, of course, meet the political criteria.
The European Union cannot allow one agreement partner that which it denies another.
The Association Council must, therefore, look into the human rights situation as a matter of great urgency and draft a democratisation programme.
If the European Union keeps quiet any longer, it will be partly responsible for the human rights violations in Tunisia.
Mr President, I would like to reiterate the welcome to Mr Marzouki and Mr Ksila, and in doing so, I would like to show my respect for the tenacity that they have shown in overcoming the obstacles put in their way by the Tunisian authorities in order to visit us here.
These obstacles will be familiar to all the democrats who, at some time or another, have sought to speak freely about their situation.
This is the fate of Sihen Ben Sedrine, who is being prevented from carrying out his professional duties since his publishers, Aloès, were closed down for having taken on the journalist, Taoufik Ben Brik.
Furthermore, his passport is still being withheld.
Following the high-school students' uprising, Taoufik Ben Brik' s hunger strike finally brought into the open, into the public domain, what international human rights organisations and some Tunisian democrats had been saying and writing for several years: the repressive police regime uses harassment, random punishment, torture, imprisonment, attacks on personal dignity, and prohibits people who wish to live freely from speaking, writing, travelling and meeting.
Who today can still deny the truth of this or claim that they were unaware of it?
We should be talking about the Tunisian 'mirage' rather than the Tunisian 'miracle' .
What good is economic success if it is achieved by force and benefits only one particular clan?
What good is the praise of international financial organisations in the face of UN accusations of torture?
The fact that democracy and the rule of law form an essential integral part of our association with Tunisia means, quite simply, that there can be no genuine association without democracy.
All those, like myself, who are working for a closer partnership, for a fair association and for lasting cooperation are faced with a difficult challenge: to put democratic flesh on the bones of an agreement signed with a regime which proclaims it in theory but declaims against it in practice.
In order to achieve these objectives, we must use the whole legal and institutional arsenal available to us - including, of course, the terms of the agreement itself - in order to bridge the gulf between form and content, words and deeds and between declarations and actual decisions.
The fact that this debate, which we have awaited for several years, is now being held, is an achievement in itself.
For democrats on both sides of the House, it marks the end of the strategy of polite pressure, which has been as secretive as it is inefficient.
Yes, we want a meeting of the Association Council, which was created as a result of the shortcomings observed in the way Article 2 of the agreement was being implemented!
Yes, we must begin a process which is well organised, binding, and which signposts tangible and demonstrable progress: a halt to torture, the return of passports and the reconnection of telephone lines can and must be implemented immediately!
There must be a precise timetable, which is respected, for the recognition of associations and independent political groups such as the CNLT (the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia), the RAD and the Democratic Forum, respect for union freedom, for the integrity of the judicial system and the reform of the press code.
Yes, the European Union must be capable of supporting projects which strengthen civil society and democracy, without being at the mercy of the dictates of the Tunisian authorities!
Yes, we must broaden the dialogue to include all the diverse and independent operators in Tunisian society!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how can we be anything but saddened?
It has taken us four years to hold this debate, four years, because the Socialist Group and the European People' s Group have blocked this debate for four years.
That is the reality of this Parliament' s position on the Tunisian question.
The Tunisian question is an incredibly depressing one, and it is depressing because of our attitude towards it.
The Tunisian question, Madam Napoletano, is not a human rights issue, but an issue of democracy and rule of law, and yet, once again, when it comes to Tunisia, we prefer the guarantee of a strong man.
We are prepared to have his son to replace him when he dies, as we are doing in Syria and say nothing about it.
We close our eyes to the reality of the situation.
We do not wish to see the fact that Tunisia, which is in an infinitely better state than any of its neighbouring countries, such as Morocco and Algeria, has not taken a single step towards developing the rule of law in the last twelve years, since Mr Ben Ali came to power.
We do not wish to see the fact that strengthening and even, in some cases, improving the economic and social domain, although the point could be argued, is not the same as developing democracy; it is not the same as developing the rule of law.
It guarantees nothing.
It only provides guarantees for the despot in power.
So what can we do?
We have an association agreement that has been presented to us as a model agreement, while other countries, again Morocco and Algeria, are making progress.
We concluded this model agreement with the country which seemed to have all the right assets to take the great leap forwards into democracy and the rule of law.
Our intransigence - and our right to intervene, Mrs Napoletano - must therefore be tough, even ferocious.
We can no longer tolerate the fact that a regime such as Tunisia' s, with all the advantages that it has, locks its citizens up, imprisons and tortures them a stone' s throw from the coast of Sicily, a stone' s throw from the coasts of France and Spain.
It is unacceptable.
An extraordinary Association Council meeting must be held in order to put an end to this situation and finally to do something to help, to be Tunisians ourselves.
Mr President, in March, the Delegation for Relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which I am vice-chairman, made a visit to Tunisia, where we observed that, while there has been undeniable economic progress, there exists a democratic deficit in the field of freedoms, particularly in the area of the press and the audiovisual media.
We were also able to observe - and I think this should be stressed - that the Tunisian authorities are aware of this deficit, which they justified time and time again through the need to temper their political openness in accordance with their particular idiosyncrasies and culture as well as the danger to Tunisian society of the growth of Islamic fundamentalism.
They therefore asked for understanding and patience.
I must say that the Tunisian Government has made gestures which indicate goodwill.
They made these gestures during our visit and this is reflected in the report which the delegation has presented to Parliament.
In the view of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats and European Democrats), we are therefore holding a debate which is necessary but which should not take the form of an exaggerated and alarmist condemnation, which is often what happens, but which should recognise certain facts which concern us because they affect the areas covered in the association agreement, such as the respect for human rights and democratic principles.
This issue must be resolved by means of political and social dialogue, and an effort on the part of the Tunisian Government to implement legislation which will guarantee political pluralism in a real sense and not in a purely formal sense and, above all, provide the necessary freedom so that the citizens can express their opinions and the media can reflect them.
This is the message which this House must send to the Tunisian authorities, who must receive them in the positive light in which they are intended.
To this end, within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, the Commission, the Council and Parliament must not go into reverse with regard to the aid programmes which must be implemented within the framework of MEDA II.
Education and training in democratic principles are a fundamental element of sustaining a plural and democratic society.
Young people, judges, the police and journalists need to have full knowledge of the rights they must exercise and defend.
This is the area in which the European Union can and must cooperate.
It also concerns me that Commissioner Patten, who is present, is not sufficiently sensitive to the serious problems currently faced on the southern side of the Mediterranean, where Tunisia plays a very important role.
Emigration, fundamentalism, poverty and political instability cannot be resolved by pronouncements and good intentions alone.
We need true political will and the economic and human resources to put it into practice.
In any event - and this could serve as a summary of the debate - we cannot restrict our cooperation with third countries to purely trade and economic issues.
To this end, we also ask Tunisia, together with economic reforms, also to make progress with political reforms aimed at guaranteeing freedoms, but with the aid and cooperation which, of course, they receive and will continue to receive from us, at least from my Group.
We also believe that we need a common strategy in the Mediterranean, as the resolution states, and that, together with political, social and security aspects, special attention is paid to the cultural and human dimension.
This is why we need to strengthen the interparliamentary dialogue and the dialogue with the representatives of civil society.
As we say in my country, By talking we come to understand people' .
If one thing characterises the people of the Mediterranean, it is the wealth of their thought and their words, and that, ladies and gentlemen, costs very little.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we start to examine an issue like this we should remind ourselves of the European Union' s general attitude to its external relations.
The EU has a set of values and principles which it naturally tries to promote in its relations and which it tries to use in all areas of its associations with third countries.
Contrary to what may be inferred from one honourable Member' s intervention, the European Union does not act according to geographical position by being more demanding on countries which are closer and less demanding on countries which are further away.
We do not work in this way.
We usually use uniform criteria and, in particular, the idea that it is preferable to open areas for dialogue in order to encourage countries to make regular bilateral assessments of what is causing exclusion factors or misunderstandings.
In this respect, the work of the Council and Commission is totally coherent.
In particular, and I do not really need to say this, Commissioner Patten has more credentials than most of us on the issue of respect for human rights.
On the specific issue of Tunisia, I must say that the Council is fully aware of the human rights situation in this country.
It has noted all the concerns expressed on various occasions by this House.
Naturally, it has also noted the considerable concerns expressed here today.
The Council has on several occasions emphasised to the Tunisian authorities its concern about the occurrence of certain situations, particularly the lack of general freedom and press freedom in particular.
Human rights issues are frequently discussed, as the speakers have noted, within the political dialogue which the Council is conducting with Tunisia within the Association Council and through the Heads of Mission of the Member States in Tunis who have regular meetings with the relevant Tunisian government officials in this area.
At the moment this dialogue is centred specifically on the current reforms of the new press law, the operation and functions of the penalty enforcement judge and the amendments of electoral law.
The possibility of such a dialogue, which Tunisia did refuse for some time, represents significant progress.
During the two meetings of the Association Council which took place as part of our relations with Tunisia and which I attended, the Council reiterated the fundamental importance to relations between the European Union and Tunisia of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and, naturally, it used the opportunity to highlight certain specific cases, some of which have been mentioned here.
On a more national note, during the State visit by President Ben Ali to Portugal at the beginning of May, the Foreign Minister, Jaime Gama, had the opportunity to raise with his Tunisian counterpart the human rights situation in Tunisia and in particular the case of the journalist, Taouffik Ben Brick.
He underlined the constant need to respect fundamental freedoms.
We realise that any kind of action in terms of political pressure can have advantages where carried out through the media.
We believe that there is room for several dimensions to be used in the international arena on this type of issue and we do not reject the efficacy of these actions.
However, the Council prefers to use the opportunities for influencing the Tunisian authorities more discreetly, and perhaps more effectively, by maintaining constructive pressure on them through political dialogue and various meetings at different levels.
We do not consider it appropriate to initiate the procedures needed to suspend the Association Agreement or to convene an extraordinary session of the Association Council which would probably be reported in the media but which would have no practical effect in specific terms.
Maintaining regular dialogue and continuing all the steps which have been made so far, when and if appropriate, is the right way to proceed in this context.
Despite these difficulties and the problems in moving this process forward which we all recognise, we must accept that there have been positive results.
We cannot ignore, and it would be politically incorrect to so do, the gestures of openness already made by Tunisia, particularly in freeing 600 political prisoners, returning passports to certain members of the opposition and being clearly willing to reduce tensions in the case of the journalist, Taouffik Ben Brick, and accepting his specific claims.
The Commission has also tried to finance actions in order to promote human rights and democracy in Tunisia through the MEDA programme for democracy and may provide further information in this respect.
Finally, in the Barcelona Declaration, Tunisia, like the other Mediterranean partner countries, signed up to certain principles involving respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Within the EU-Mediterranean framework and in reinforcing this framework as we are trying to do at the moment in close cooperation with the European Commission, we are also insisting on the importance of actively promoting the rule of law and the good management of public affairs which constitutes a key area in the dialogue between the two sides of the Mediterranean.
To conclude, I must assure you that the Council remains committed to promoting and reinforcing in Tunisia, as in other countries with which the EU maintains relations, respect for human rights, democratic principles and fundamental freedoms, and to establishing a true democracy with an open civil society based on a rule of law.
A measured policy is, in our opinion, the best way to achieve these objectives.
The Council will continue to pursue discreet but firm diplomacy and will continue its policy of encouraging all forms of progress towards democracy and the rule of law.
I am extremely grateful to the House for the opportunity to comment on these extremely important matters.
As a number of honourable Members have noted, Mr Taoufik Ben Brik's hunger strike is over, but it has had a major impact both on the authorities in Tunisia and on civil society.
It sparked a public debate in Tunisia on the human rights situation in that country.
I want to make it clear that the Commission shares the view of the UN Special Rapporteur who states in his report to the Commission on Human Rights that: "Tunisia still has a long way to go to take full advantage of its favourable economic context and adopt measures designed to strengthen the protection of human rights and, in particular, the right to freedom of opinion and expression".
But how can the Commission and the European Union in general influence Tunisia's rate of progress in this area?
This is best done by looking at the three main instruments provided by the association agreement linking the European Union to Tunisia.
The first, to which my colleague referred, is political dialogue.
This dialogue has already given us the opportunity to comment on Tunisia's human rights situation twice at ministerial level at the two Association Councils that have taken place to date.
The Union has made a point of addressing the human rights issues in Tunisia in our many contacts with the Tunisian authorities.
The second instrument is the financing of positive measures in the form of grants from the Community budget for projects promoting the exercise of political and civil rights.
The MEDA programme for democracy, on which Parliament has strong and positive views, has financed training, information and awareness-raising projects for NGOs and for public opinion in this field.
A programme of support for the Tunisian media has already been included in the programming of future financial cooperation with Tunisia and should be the subject of necessary consultations with the Tunisian Government.
As Mr Dupuis reminded us, sustainable economic development and political stability depend, above all, from Russia to the Mediterranean, on strong institutions, not on strong men.
It sometimes requires strong men to ensure that the institutions themselves are strong and operate within the rule of law.
The third instrument is the European Union's option of adopting restrictive measures, the most radical of which would obviously be the suspension of cooperation.
The Commission considers that, before having recourse to any restrictive measures, positive means offered by the partnership should be pursued to the limit.
There is still significant scope both at the level of political dialogue and the financing of support programmes.
I would like to explore this further with Tunisia.
Specifically, the Commission wishes to see to what extent the Tunisian Government will implement its promises regarding reform of the press code and facilitating freedom of association.
We also wish to see if our efforts to support the desired reforms by providing funding from the Community budget prove successful.
I will keep Parliament informed of developments in all these areas.
The issues that we have been discussing this afternoon are extremely important.
I know that Parliament is aware of the whole picture.
Mrs Napoletano, in her interesting address, pointed out the economic and social progress that has been made in Tunisia.
Others could have referred, for example, to the position of Tunisia on the sharia law.
Nevertheless, there are issues which give considerable cause for concern.
It is best at the moment to proceed by dialogue but, as the House will understand, I do not equate dialogue with being supine.
Parliament has legitimate concerns and a strongly felt point of view.
That can be expressed firmly but courteously, as Parliament is doing today.
I want to put the debate on Tunisia in context and to take up a point that was made by Mr Hernández Mollar and some other honourable Members as well.
Of course there will be events and developments that crowd in on us.
Today, inevitably, we have to give a good deal of attention to our efforts to rebuilding in the Balkans and, in particular, to prevent further social and political disintegration.
It is a policy in south-east Europe which, I should add, is not irrelevant to stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean.
But if I have to judge where we are going to face the main challenge in the medium and longer term, it would be, to be candid, our policy in and around the Mediterranean.
What is at the heart of the Union's common foreign and security policy?
It is the projection of stability.
That is the crucial element in our policy in the Mediterranean.
What are we trying to do there?
It is true that we are trying to create, if you like, the Mediterranean equivalent of NAFTA.
But there is more than that, which I will come to in a moment.
I just want to make it clear to the honourable Member that my commitment to making this policy a success is total.
One of the things that most offends me at the moment is that our record in supporting it through development assistance is not nearly as good as it should have been.
For year after year we have only been able to spend 40% or less of what we have committed in the Mediterranean, partly because of absorption problems in the region, partly because of our own failures, which I am keen to address.
I will make this bargain with the honourable Member: if, by the time I leave my job as a commissioner in 2005, our record in closing the gap between commitments and payments is not a hell of a lot better than it has been in the last three years then he can have a contribution to his favourite charity.
That is what I would like to be taken as a mark of whether or not we are committed to making a success of our policy in the Mediterranean.
It is extremely important that we use our existing instruments much more competently, much more effectively.
That is what I would like to be judged on.
I want to repeat: this is not just about creating a free trade area, important as that may be.
Free trade is not the end; free trade is a means to an end.
The end is the creation of an area of prosperity and political stability to the south of the sea that we have shared with North Africa and the Middle East for all these millennia; it is about the sharing of values, as well as the sharing of trade.
It is not about creating hub economies which will make Europeans more prosperous: it is about working in partnership with Mediterranean countries in a partnership of values as well as trade, for the good of people to the south of the Mediterranean as well as those of us in Europe.
It is an enormously important part of Europe's endeavours over the next few years; as important, in some ways in projecting stability, as the whole process of enlargement.
I very much hope that in the next five years we will be able to carry that programme forward in Tunisia and the rest of the region.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today' s debate enables us to stand back a little from the events in Tunisia of the last few weeks, and gain some perspective, particularly with regard to what has become known as the Ben Brik affair.
There has been particularly widespread coverage of these events in the media, and this has, let there be no doubt about it, enabled pressure to be put on the Tunisian authorities to remedy the situation as quickly and as humanely as possible.
The huge media coverage of the affair, however, has also led to some people assuming that it reflects the situation in Tunisia as a whole, which runs quite counter to the facts and the reality with which we are familiar.
As my friend and colleague, Mr Hernández Mollar, pointed out, the EPP hopes that, today, we will be able to give a message of hope and support to all Tunisians who are committed to their country pursuing the path of political as well as economic reform.
The European Parliament has a duty to act fairly and straightforwardly with all the Mediterranean countries that are part of the Barcelona Process.
We are sometimes criticised - particularly in Tunisia - for treating some countries more harshly than others, and on this issue, I should like to point out that the principles and the values contained in the Barcelona Declaration, and reiterated in every partnership agreement with a Mediterranean country, are the same for all countries, including Member States of the Union.
Tunisia is not being treated differently in any way.
This message of hope is founded, in part, upon the economic and social achievements that we have seen Tunisia make.
We must, however, also respect our commitments and our convictions, and I think that we would be doing Tunisians a favour by convincing them that our Parliament will always pay close attention to developments in the political situation and in civil society in their country, regardless of the good economic results that may have been achieved.
We must also persuade all of our Mediterranean partners that the commitments which they have given through taking part in the Barcelona process, specifically in the field of democracy and human rights, are not negotiable.
Finally, then, I would urge all Members to staunchly support the motion for a resolution that we have tabled today, which, I think, provides a balanced picture of Parliament' s views on the situation in Tunisia.
I have no doubt that this message will be received in the appropriate way by the Tunisian authorities, who will step up and continue the initial measures that they have already adopted.
Mr President, one of the best pieces of theatre criticism to be published in Europe in the 20th Century, in my humble opinion, went something like this: 'Yesterday was the opening of such and such a play, by such and such a writer' .
I could not hope to emulate the crushing brevity of this, in my view, brilliant journalistic comment.
However, my question is practically the same.
Why are we arguing about the situation in Tunisia?
Why is there a certain crisis in the relations between Europe and Tunisia at the moment which, in one way or another, no doubt affects the relations between the institutions of the European Union and the Tunisian authorities within the framework of cooperation and the association agreement?
I believe that this is a useful question to ask, because only by understanding as accurately as possible what is happening in Tunisia and the challenges faced by that country, will we be able to find the tone of moderation and effectiveness which we must develop within the framework of cooperation.
There is a great paradox in Tunisia at the moment and my concern is that this paradox may be becoming increasingly dangerous.
Tunisia is the most peaceful and prosperous country of the Maghreb, but also has the most closed press and media in the Maghreb.
It is the country with the greatest growth and with the greatest advances in terms of social modernisation, particularly in terms of education and the status of women; however it is the country in which the emergence of a civil society, which is born of this economic and social growth, does not have adequate means to express itself in complete freedom.
It is a country which is, and has been, in the forefront of the association agreements and the agro-Mediterranean policy, and which has signed all the international conventions on human rights but where, nevertheless, time and time again problems arise relating to human rights which are exaggerated by sections of the European media.
Believe me, I am sensitive to the question of human rights.
I have spent fifteen years of my life without a passport or driving licence.
I have had experiences, which I will not describe, in the police stations and prisons of the Franco dictatorship, but I believe that the fundamental problem in Tunisia at the moment is a different one: the future of Tunisia.
We will only be fulfilling our obligations if we in the European Union find the tone and the effectiveness to help the sectors in Tunisia who are in favour of the development needed to accompany and safeguard the future of economic growth and social modernisation.
I will end by saying that I share to a large extent the points which Commissioner Patten has expressed, but I would also like to hear from the Commissioner that he also feels a deep concern for Euro-Mediterranean policy, for the policy relating to the Maghreb.
Only by ensuring that we are not in a situation where the Council is giving less priority to the Mediterranean, the Commission is hindering the implementation of programmes and the European Parliament is simply giving lectures, will we be able to find the tone and effectiveness of a policy which will help the future of Tunisia, in friendship and solidarity, towards a situation which brings both socio-economic growth and full democratisation.
A lot is at stake, not only in Tunisia, but also in the whole of the region, when it comes to achieving the objectives of this task.
Mr President, the Liberal group obviously endorses the text as tabled in full.
Having said that, I must wonder, apart from the normal, accepted role-playing that goes on between the institutions, what good it will actually do and above all, apart from the ideas put forward by Commissioner Patten just now, what the Commission will really do.
How dynamic will it be?
How determined will it be?
What involvement can it guarantee?
I should also like to know if Commissioner Patten' s irritation at the Commission' s foreign policy might not bring about a certain change of attitude towards the issue that we are considering here.
With regard to this matter, Commissioner, I harbour doubts as to the formal, practical will of the Commission as an institution, as the driving force for European construction .
What you ought to do, perhaps, is to tell us quite precisely what your specific approach will be, so that in one or two months' time, we will not have to say that the text on which we are voting has once again become dead letter at European level.
I have two very specific questions.
Paragraph 11 of the motion for a resolution suggests that we will be entrusting our parliamentary delegation with the task of studying the situation.
Will you be producing a specific Commission document, in order to assist the work of our delegates?
My second question, which concerns the very short term, is this: a special meeting of the General Affairs Council has been announced for 18 June, in order to prepare the dossier on the Mediterranean region.
What exactly is the dossier that will be tabled next Sunday, concerning that region?
This is the specific political follow-up that I expect, and which will perhaps enable you, Commissioner, and perhaps your fellow Commissioners too, to dispel what I called the climate of irritation where the efficiency of the Commission' s foreign policy is concerned.
Mr President, we have had to wait until the end of this parliamentary term for the truth to finally break out in the European Parliament.
Having returned from a mission to Tunisia with three of my colleagues, I shall talk about the problems of union freedom.
The great wave of repression that has swept over the opposition of all political hues since the 1990s has allowed the government to seize control of the General Union of Tunisian Workers, the GUTW.
Arrests, sackings of union leaders, threats and pressure of all kinds have combined with the authoritarianism of the union hierarchy in order to subdue one of the most combative labour organisations in the region.
The extremely severe legal restrictions on the right to strike have been made even harsher by the current leadership.
For a strike to be legal in Tunisia, the executive of the GUTW now has to give its approval.
Meetings, which cannot normally be held in the workplace, are also regularly banned on union premises.
Union leaders have been stripped of their powers and taken to court for having criticised the management of the trade union group in a simple internal petition.
12 of them were arrested by the police in April 1999 and spent more than 48 hours at the Ministry for Internal Affairs for having questioned the irregular conditions in which the GUTW congress took place.
Amongst these, we wish to mention Abdeljalil Bedoui, Ali Romdhane, Abdelmajid Sahraoui, Abdennour Maddahi, Hamed Bennjima, Noureddine Ounissa, Chaker Ben Hassine, and many others.
Ben Ali' s regime is exercising tight control over the whole world of labour.
The repression is not only aimed at political opponents.
It affects the whole of the population, particularly in working class neighbourhoods, and the small towns and villages in the underprivileged regions.
The report by the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia estimates the number of policemen at 130 000 for a population of 9.5 million inhabitants.
To this figure we should add the unofficial policemen controlled by the network of neighbourhood committees, reporting directly to the Ministry of the Interior, which monitors and subdues a defenceless population.
These facts give us a better understanding of this pseudo-democracy, in which the President wins the elections with 99.44% of the vote.
Mr President, let the Tunisian people, who are represented here by two of their number, know that we support them in their fight for freedom and that we will not desert them.
Mr President, the paradoxes of this Parliament never cease to amaze us.
We do not hesitate to set about installing a political regime in Kosovo which is antidemocratic and made up of only one ethnic group, from which the non-native populations, if I may call them that, will be excluded.
We do not hesitate to sign trade agreements with China, a totalitarian country if ever there was one, which ordered 1800 executions last year alone - that is the official total - and at the same time, we allow ourselves to pass judgement on the Tunisian government with what is, to my mind, uncalled for severity.
