Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 37
Question of Palestine
Letter dated 27 June 2005 from the Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People addressed to the President of the General Assembly
I have the honour to inform you that I received a letter, dated 31 May 2005, from the Permanent Representative of Romania to the United Nations, Mihnea Motoc, in which he informed me about the decision of the Government of Romania to discontinue its membership in the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People as from 31 May 2005 (see annex).
At the 286th meeting of the Committee, on 21 June 2005, the issue was brought to the attention of the Committee membership, which took note of the information.
I should like to suggest that the General Assembly be informed, at a suitable time, about the aforementioned change in the membership of the Committee.
I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly under agenda item 37.
(Signed) Paul Badji Chairman Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People
