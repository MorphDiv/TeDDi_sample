Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus
The General Assembly,
Having considered the note by the Secretary-General on the financing arrangements for the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,
Recalling Security Council resolution 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964, regarding the establishment of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 1568 (2004) of 22 October 2004,
Recalling also its resolution 47/236 of 14 September 1993 on the financing of the Force for the period beginning 16 June 1993 and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 58/301 of 18 June 2004,
Reaffirming the general principles underlying the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations as stated in General Assembly resolutions 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, 3101 (XXVIII) of 11 December 1973 and 55/235 of 23 December 2000,
Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,
Noting that voluntary contributions were insufficient to cover all the costs of the Force, including those incurred by troop-contributing Governments prior to 16 June 1993, and regretting the absence of an adequate response to appeals for voluntary contributions, including that contained in the letter dated 17 May 1994 from the Secretary-General to all Member States,
Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,
Takes note of the note by the Secretary-General on the financing arrangements for the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2
Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus as at 28 February 2005, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 24.1 million United States dollars, representing some 10 per cent of the total assessed contributions, notes with concern that only forty-one Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;
Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full;
Expresses concern at the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;
Also expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, in particular those in Africa;
Emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements;
Also emphasizes that all peacekeeping missions shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates;
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to make the fullest possible use of facilities and equipment at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, in order to minimize the costs of procurement for the Force;
Endorses the observations and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation;
Requests the Secretary-General to expedite negotiations with the host Government on issues surrounding the relocation of military contingent personnel as well as other personnel of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, in accordance with the provisions of the March 1964 Agreement between the United Nations and the Government of Cyprus;
Also requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;
Further requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff, to continue efforts to recruit local staff for the Force against General Service posts, commensurate with the requirements of the Force;
Decides to continue to maintain as separate the account established for the Force for the period prior to 16 June 1993, invites Member States to make voluntary contributions to that account, and requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts in appealing for voluntary contributions to the account;
Emphasizes that no peacekeeping mission shall be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions;
Encourages the Secretary-General to continue to take additional measures to ensure the safety and security of all personnel under the auspices of the United Nations participating in the Force;
Invites voluntary contributions to the Force in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure and practices established by the General Assembly;
