Sixtieth session
Item 99 (d) of the provisional agenda*
Review and implementation of the Concluding Document of the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly: United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific
Letter dated 2 August 2005 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Nepal to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
I am writing with reference to the letter dated 21 October 2004 received from the Secretariat regarding the relocation of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific to Kathmandu.
I wish to recall General Assembly resolution 59/100 of 3 December 2004 urging you to ensure the physical operation of the Regional Centre from Kathmandu within six months of the date of the host country agreement and to enable the Centre to function effectively.
I would also like to draw your attention to paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 49/76 D of 15 December 1994.
His Majesty's Government has reiterated its firm commitment to the relocation of the Centre from United Nations Headquarters in New York and its eagerness to sign the host country agreement with the United Nations at the earliest possible date.
I wish to inform you that His Majesty's Government is flexible to the utmost degree and is ready to sort out the outstanding issues relating to the relocation of the Centre to Kathmandu.
Privileges and immunities to locally recruited staff of the Centre will be accorded in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Convention on Immunities and Privileges of the United Nations of 1946.
His Majesty's Government shall also bear the requisite operating costs of the Centre, including additional security related expenses.
I have requested the Department of Disarmament Affairs to provide us with a revised text of the host country agreement incorporating the above elements in order that we may arrange for an early signing of the Agreement.
I would appreciate if you could kindly circulate the present letter as a document of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly under item 99 (d) of the provisional agenda.
(Signed) Arjun Bahadur Thapa
Chargé d'affaires a.i.
