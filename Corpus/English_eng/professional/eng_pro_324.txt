[Original: Chinese/Russian]
Joint statement by the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation on the international order in the twenty-first century
The Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as “the Parties”),
In connection with the sixtieth anniversary that is being marked of the victory in the Second World War and the sixtieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations,
Guided by the feeling of the historical responsibility for peace and development on the planet which they bear as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council,
On the basis of their commitment to the establishment of a multipolar world and a new international order, expressed in the Russian-Chinese Joint Declaration on a Multipolar World and the Establishment of a New International Order of 23 April 1997,
Confirming the Parties' relations based on strategic interaction and partnership that are laid down in the Treaty on Good-Neighbourliness, Friendship and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China of 16 July 2001,
Declare the following:
Today, the world is undergoing changes of historic dimensions.
The establishment of a new international order promises to be complex and lengthy.
Peace and development remain, as in the past, a recurring theme of the age.
The processes of the establishment of a multipolar world order and economic globalization, which are major trends in the contemporary stage of mankind's development, are transpiring in an uneven and contradictory manner.
The interdependence of States is sharply increasing.
The maintenance of peace, stability and security for all and comprehensive harmonious development under conditions of equality, observance of sovereignty, mutual respect, mutual advantage and guarantees for the development prospects of future generations are becoming central tasks for mankind in the twenty-first century.
Mankind has the possibility to achieve these objectives jointly.
At the same time, it is encountering many global challenges such as international terrorism, the threat of the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the gap between poor and rich, environmental degradation, epidemics, transnational organized crime, drug trafficking and so forth.
The tasks confronting mankind can be resolved only under conditions of a just and rational world order that is founded on generally recognized principles and norms of international law.
All countries in the world must strictly observe the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual advantage, and peaceful coexistence.
The rights of all countries to choose their path of development in accordance with their specific national characteristics, equal participation in international affairs and equal development must be fully guaranteed.
Disagreements and disputes must be peacefully resolved, unilateral acts must be avoided and there must be no resorting to a policy of diktat or the threat or use of force.
The affairs of each country must be dealt with by its people independently, and world affairs through dialogue and consultation on the basis of multilateral collective approaches.
The international community must fully rid itself of confrontational and bloc-oriented thinking, the desire to monopolize and dominate in international affairs and attempts to divide States into the leaders and the led.
The United Nations is the most universal, representative and authoritative international organization; its place and role in the world are indispensable.
The United Nations must play a central role in international affairs and must be the centre for elaborating and implementing the basic norms of international law.
United Nations peacemaking operations must conform to the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.
It is necessary to follow strictly the corresponding Security Council resolutions and develop United Nations cooperation with regional and subregional organizations.
The United Nations must play a more prominent role in the consideration of the issues of global economics and development.
United Nations reforms must aim to strengthen its central role in international affairs, enhance its effectiveness, and strengthen its potential for reacting to new challenges and threats.
Reforms must be conducted on the basis of the principle of consensus and must fully reflect the common interests of a broad number of Member States.
The process of globalization in its positive sense is promoting world economic development through the unprecedented dynamic expansion of trade and economic relations and the widest possible openness in terms of information.
On the other hand, globalization is developing in a very unbalanced way and is accompanied by an increase in the gap between developed countries and regions and the rest of the world.
In order to ensure the healthy development of the processes of globalization, it is necessary to increase coordination and mutually advantageous cooperation between States and regions, reject any manifestations of discrimination in economic relations, reduce the gap between poor and rich, and promote joint prosperity by broadening and deepening trade and economic and scientific and technical exchanges.
The international community must develop a universal, mutually acceptable trade and economic regime.
The path to achieving this is through negotiations on an equal footing, rejection of the use of pressure and sanctions to achieve unilateral economic concessions, and utilizing the mechanisms of the global and regional multilateral organizations.
The developing countries, where the greater part of the planet's population lives, are a major force that supports peace and development throughout the world.
The international community must accord great attention to the task of overcoming the gap in the levels of development between the developing and developed countries.
The way to carry out this task is, first and foremost, by ensuring equal access on the part of all the members of the world community to socio-economic, scientific and technical, information-related, cultural and other opportunities that are being opened up through globalization, increasing mutually advantageous “North-South” and “South-South” cooperation, and the joint development and fulfilment by the countries concerned of the corresponding obligations undertaken within the framework of the United Nations and other multilateral structures.
Human rights are universal.
All States must respect the human rights and basic freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, promote the guaranteeing of human rights and protect them with account taken of the specific character and traditions of each country, and resolve differences on the basis of the principles of equality and mutual respect and through dialogue and cooperation.
The international protection of human rights must be based on the principles of the rigorous defence of the sovereign equality of all States and non-interference in their internal affairs.
It is necessary to respect the historical traditions of multinational States, promote peaceful coexistence and the joint development of different peoples, and also make efforts to defend State unity.
Any actions aimed at splitting up sovereign States and stirring up discord among peoples are inadmissible.
The objective processes of the social development of sovereign States cannot be ignored, and models of social and political structures cannot be imposed on them from without.
The diversity of cultures and civilizations in the world must become the basis for their mutual enrichment, not for conflicts.
The defining requirement of the world under contemporary conditions is not the “clash of civilizations”, but rather the need for global cooperation.
We must respect and protect the diversity of the world's civilizations and models of development.
The differences in the historical heritage of all countries, their cultural traditions, social and political structure, value systems and paths of development must not become a pretext for interference in the internal affairs of another State.
A dialogue between civilizations and an exchange of experience must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and tolerance, and there is a need to enrich and complement one another on behalf of our joint advancement along the path of progress.
The role of humanitarian exchanges must be enhanced in order to establish friendly and trusting relations between States.
The Parties call upon the international community to join efforts to create a new architecture of security based on mutual trust, mutual advantage, equality of rights and cooperation.
The generally recognized norms of international relations must be its political basis, and mutually advantageous cooperation and shared prosperity must be its economic basis.
The new architecture of security must be founded on respect for the equal right of all States to security.
Dialogue based on equal rights, consultations and negotiations must be the means for resolving contradictions and protecting peace.
The Parties are committed to the cause of maintaining and strengthening global strategic stability, legal systems and multilateral processes in the field of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation.
They advocate the speedy entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and are endeavouring to promote the universalization and enhanced effectiveness of such arms control and non-proliferation treaties as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological Weapons and the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The Parties call for the peaceful use of outer space and preventing the stationing of weapons and an arms race in outer space and, to that end, advocate the development of a corresponding international legal agreement.
The Parties believe that, in the face of new threats and challenges, it is necessary to undertake additional effective measures to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the means for their delivery and corresponding materials.
To achieve these purposes, the Parties are filled with determination to cooperate closely within the framework of the relevant international organizations and forums and also to broaden interaction with all other States.
Proliferation problems must be tackled within the framework of international law through political, diplomatic and international cooperation.
The Parties will promote the implementation of the initiative to establish, under the auspices of the United Nations, a global system for countering new challenges and threats to security on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations and corresponding norms of international law.
Within the framework of the new architecture of security, international cooperation must be strengthened, and there must be a joint search for ways to deprive terrorists of financial sources and social support and eradicate the ideology of terrorism and extremism — an ideology of violence and racial, ethnic and religious discord.
Double standards are inadmissible in this matter.
The blatant human rights violations committed by terrorists and terrorist organizations must be firmly condemned by all members of the international community.
Terrorist organizations must be prevented from acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction and the means for their delivery.
Regional integration is an important facet of development in the contemporary international situation.
The Parties note the positive role being played in the process of establishing a new international order by regional multilateral organizations operating on the basis of open regionalism, equal cooperation and a non-selective approach to other countries.
In the economic field, regional initiatives must promote the greater openness and effectiveness of trade associations.
In the area of regional security, the creation of an open mechanism for cooperation in the field of security that is non-selective towards other countries on the basis of the comprehensive consideration of the interests of all parties is a matter of principle.
The Parties are in favour of developing horizontal links between regional integration associations and establishing a climate of mutual trust and cooperation among them.
The new inter-State relations being established between the Russian Federation and China are making a weighty contribution to the creation of the new international order.
The practice of Russian-Chinese relations confirms the viability of the principles set forth in this Declaration and demonstrates that relations of good-neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation can be effectively developed on the basis of such principles and that various problems can be solved.
Both Parties are filled with determination to make untiring efforts, together with other interested States, to build a developing and harmonious world and to act as a major constructive force for a secure world order.
The establishment of a rational and just international order in the twenty-first century involves the continual search for approaches and decisions that are acceptable to all.
The new world order will become truly universal only to the extent that its principles and norms are shared by all the entities participating in international life.
The Parties call upon all the countries of the world to conduct a broad dialogue on the issue of the international order in the twenty-first century.
The future of the world and the ability of mankind to proceed along the path of progress and find answers to the challenges and threats that arise depend to a considerable extent on the results of that dialogue.
