Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 113
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations
Letter dated 15 July 2005 from the Secretary-General to the President of the General Assembly
At present 10 Member States are in arrears under the terms of Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations, which states:
“A Member of the United Nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years.
The General Assembly may, nevertheless, permit such a Member to vote if it is satisfied that the failure to pay is due to conditions beyond the control of the Member.”
The minimum payments necessary to reduce the amounts owed by those Member States on their contributions so that they remain below the gross amount assessed for the preceding two full years (2003 and 2004) are as follows:
a By its resolution 59/312 of 14 July 2005, the General Assembly decided that the Central African Republic, the Comoros, Georgia, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, the Niger, Sao Tome and Principe, Somalia and Tajikistan should be permitted to vote in the General Assembly until the Assembly takes a final decision during the main part of its sixtieth session.
(Signed) Kofi Annan Secretary-General
