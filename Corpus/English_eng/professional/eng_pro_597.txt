Introduction
The twenty-third session of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum was held at UNEP headquarters, Nairobi, from 21 to 25 February 2005.
The Council adopted the present report at the 10th plenary meeting of the session, on 25 February 2005.
Opening of the session
The twenty-third session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum was opened at 10.20 a.m. on 21 February 2005 by the master of ceremonies.
The proceedings commenced with a musical performance by the Kibondo Environmental Management Association cultural group from the United Republic of Tanzania, in honour of the outgoing President of the Governing Council, Mr. Arcado Ntagazwa, Minister of State for the Environment of the United Republic of Tanzania.
Opening statements were made by Mr. Klaus Töpfer, Executive Director of UNEP; the outgoing President; Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, delivered on his behalf by Mr. Shafqat Kakakhel, Deputy Executive Director of UNEP; Ms. Anna Kajumulo Tibaijuka, Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat); Mr. Zeng Peiyan, Vice-Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China; and Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of Kenya.
Before delivering his statement, the Executive Director invited those present to take time to remember the victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster.
Participants stood to observe a minute's silence as a mark of respect for the hundreds of thousands who lost their lives in the tragedy.
In his statement, he noted with satisfaction that never before had a session of the Council/Forum been so well attended, which was indicative of the willingness of States to strengthen the environment as one of the pillars of sustainable development and demonstrated the importance of the environment globally.
He welcomed the attendance at the session of so many high-level dignitaries and representatives not only of Governments, but also of civil society, non-governmental organizations, business communities and young people.
Extending a particular welcome to Mr. Kibaki, he said that UNEP was proud, as one of only two United Nations organizations with headquarters in Africa, to have been in Kenya for 30 years.
In conclusion, he thanked the outgoing president for his excellent work.
In his statement, Mr. Ntagazwa reflected on his tenure as President of the Governing Council since the eighth special session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum, held in Jeju, Republic of Korea, in March 2004.
Noting the extent to which the outcome of the Jeju meeting had allowed international environmental governance to move forward, he said that the adoption of the Bali Strategic Plan for Technology Support and Capacity-building by the High-level Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group at its third session, in Bali, Indonesia, on 4 December 2004, was a landmark achievement.
Technology support was important not only for cleaner production and sustainable consumption, but also for viable and sustainable economic growth.
Expressing a firm belief in the concept of environment for development, he thanked the Executive Director for the support which he had provided over the past year and congratulated him on receiving an award from the Theodor Heuss Foundation, whose mission was to support democracy and promote education and culture.
The Council/Forum also heard a statement by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, delivered on his behalf by Mr. Kakakhel, Deputy Executive Director of UNEP.
In his statement, the Secretary-General noted that the task of safeguarding the environment was as urgent as ever and key to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
Success in achieving those Goals was dependent on healthy ecosystems and on the development of resources to defeat poverty, treat disease and promote sustainable economic growth.
Environmental concerns needed to be better integrated into policy-making and strategies for security, development and humanitarian action.
In the light of recent developments, including the unprecedented response to the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster, the important advances made at the International Meeting to Review the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in Port Louis, Mauritius, and the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Japan, both held in January 2005, and the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, global understanding of the interlinkages between the environment and economic development had gained fresh significance.
Noting that there was much at stake for the United Nations, he urged participants to sustain the current momentum and to ensure that UNEP had the policies and support which it needed to play its proper role.
In her statement, Ms. Tibaijuka highlighted the important partnership between UNEP and UN-Habitat and the complementarities between their mandates and activities, which were designed to ensure that the environment was an integral component of urban development and poverty alleviation efforts worldwide.
Drawing attention to the rapid joint response by the two bodies in providing assistance to the countries and people affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami, to whom she offered her condolences, she said that UNEP and UN-Habitat had worked together in providing early assessment and in coordinating mitigation and reconstruction proposals.
They would continue to adapt, strengthen and broaden their frameworks for cooperation.
In that connection, she invited the Executive Director of UNEP to address participants at the opening of the forthcoming twentieth session of the Governing Council of UN-Habitat.
Noting that the ministerial consultations to be held during the current session would focus on the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals of the Millennium Declaration, she said that the struggle to achieve those goals must be waged in human settlements, particularly slums, where rapid urbanization had led to a substantial increase in poverty.
In that regard, she announced with satisfaction that the problem of waste leakage from a sewer at the Kibera slum in Nairobi had finally been resolved and that spillage into the Nairobi dam had been halted.
Mr. Zeng Peiyan, after extending his Government's condolences to the victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster, acknowledged the important role that had been played by UNEP over the years in global environmental and development affairs and noted that the current session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum would play a positive role in the realization of the Millennium Development Goals.
Although his Government attached great importance to the issue of sustainable development and had adopted a national strategy to promote such development, China was still a developing country and suffered from many of the social and economic problems shared by developing countries worldwide.
In recognition of the fact that greater cooperation was needed to preserve the natural environment and achieve global development, his Government would increase its assistance to the countries affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster: in addition to the 500 million yuan of assistance which it was providing through bilateral channels, it had earmarked a further $20 million to be provided through multilateral channels, of which $500,000 would be channelled through UNEP.
A poem with an environmental theme was read out by Ms. Caroline N'Deritu, a contemporary Kenyan poet.
In his statement, Mr. Kibaki welcomed participants to Kenya and, recalling the recent Indian Ocean tsunami disaster, noted that the last century had seen a transformation of the world into a global village where events in one region had far-reaching consequences in others.
He conveyed his personal condolences and those of the Kenyan people to the Governments and people affected by the tsunami.
Kenya was particularly sensitive to environmental issues and the global recognition of its Nobel Laureate, Ms. Wangari Maathai, was a source of great pride and inspiration.
Welcoming the recent entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, he commended the countries which had taken the brave step of ratifying it and strongly urged those that had not to do so as soon as possible for the sake of sustainable development.
Given the nature and the scale of the challenges faced by developing countries in achieving the goals of the Millennium Declaration, increased international cooperation was needed.
Strengthening the financial and scientific base of UNEP was key to the achievement of those goals and to the fulfilment of the vision established in 1972 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm.

President: Mr. Rachmat Witoelar (Indonesia)
Vice-Presidents: Mr. Sedogo Laurent (Burkina Faso)
Ms. Sulfina Barbu (Romania)
Mr. Beat Nobs (Switzerland)
Rapporteur: Mr. Donald Cooper (Bahamas)
Pursuant to a request by the group of Western European and other States, the Council decided that, in the event that Switzerland was not a member of the Governing Council in 2006, Mr. Nobs would be replaced by a representative of a State member of the Governing Council from the group of Western European and other States.
Following his election, the President thanked the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum for entrusting him with such a challenging and noble task and expressed his gratitude to the Executive Director for his tireless efforts to promote the environment for sustainable development.
He paid special tribute to the outgoing president, Mr. Ntagazwa, whose wise counsel and leadership had contributed significantly to enhancing the role of UNEP and to the adoption of the Bali Strategic Plan on Technology Support and Capacity-building.
He expressed his gratitude to all those who were working in the common endeavour to protect the planet and congratulated Ms. Maathai, winner of the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize.
He also thanked the Government and the people of Kenya for their warm welcome and hospitality.
In view of the continuing degradation of the environment and the challenges impeding the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, it was vital to strengthen UNEP, the leadership role of the Council/Forum, cooperation and coordination with other United Nations bodies and the Environmental Management Group, which had been established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53/242 of 28 July 1999.
Cooperation and coordination were increasingly important given the recent entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol.
Reiterating the need to provide stable, adequate and predictable financial resources for UNEP, he commended Governments on the spirit of cooperation which they had shown in adopting the Bali Strategic Plan on Technology Support and Capacity-building.
He conveyed the gratitude of the people and Government of Indonesia for the assistance, expressions of sympathy and support that had been extended to them in the wake of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster.

Pursuant to one of those recommendations, it was decided that the Council/Forum would hold ministerial consultations to review the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals contained in the Millennium Declaration in relation to poverty alleviation, gender and environment, and also to policy issues related to water, sanitation and human settlements, under agenda items 5 and 6.
Also at its 1st plenary meeting, the Council/Forum decided to establish, in accordance with rule 60 of its rules of procedure, a sessional Committee of the Whole.
The Committee of the Whole would meet concurrently with the plenary to consider agenda items 4 (Assessment, monitoring and early warning: state of the environment); 7 (International environmental governance: implementation of decisions of the seventh special session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum and the World Summit on Sustainable Development on the report of the Intergovernmental Group of Ministers or Their Representatives on International Environmental Governance); 8 (Cooperation and coordination with the United Nations system on environmental matters); 9 (Programme, the Environment Fund and administrative and other budgetary matters); 10 (a) (Provisional agenda, date and place of the ninth special session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum); and 10 (b) (Provisional agenda, date and place of the twenty-fourth session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum).

The Council/Forum took note of the report at its 9th plenary meeting, on Friday, 25 February 2005.
At its 10th plenary meeting, the Council/Forum took note of the President's summary of the of the discussions by ministers and heads of delegation (UNEP/GC.23/L.3/Rev.1), which had been prepared as a contribution to the high-level meeting of the General Assembly, to be held in New York in September 2005, to review the progress made in the fulfilment of the commitments contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration.
The text of the President's summary is contained in the appendix to annex II to the proceedings.
Report of the Committee of the Whole

The report is contained in annex III to the proceedings.
H. Policy statement by the Executive Director
Also at the first plenary meeting, the Executive Director delivered a policy statement, in which he suggested that 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations, should be viewed as a year of responsibility and accountability, including responsibility for the reform of the United Nations as a whole.
The preparation of a strong Governing Council contribution to the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly to review the progress made in the fulfilment of the commitments contained in the Millennium Declaration was a task which lay before the Council/Forum.
Noting that, in Africa, the implementation of the goals of the Millennium Declaration was not only off track but heading in the wrong direction, he stressed the need for greater efforts and resources to reverse that trend.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) was a good example of solidarity in Africa.
The formal adoption by the Governing Council of the Bali Strategic Plan for Technology Support and Capacity-Building would be an important step forward for UNEP.
Approximately 30 per cent of UNEP reserve funds would be allocated in 2005 to the regional offices to promote the implementation of the Plan.
He thanked the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Conservation Union (IUCN), UN-Habitat, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) for their contributions and hard work over the past two years in partnership with UNEP, and particularly in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster.
The policy statement of the Executive Director was circulated as document UNEP/GC.23/2.
Matters requiring the special attention of the General Assembly or the Economic and Social Council
President's summary of the discussions by ministers and heads of delegation at the twenty-third session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum of the United Nations Environment Programme as a contribution to the summit meeting of the General Assembly on the implementation of the Millennium Declaration
At the 9th plenary meeting, on 25 February 2005, ministers and heads of delegation participating in the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum requested the President of the Council to convey to the President of the General Assembly, for submission to the high-level plenary meeting of the Assembly at its sixtieth session, the President's summary of the discussions on goals 1, 3, and 7 of the internationally agreed development goals contained in the Millennium Declaration.
The summary, which is contained in the appendix to annex II to the proceedings, reflects the major thrusts of the discussion among the participants, rather than providing a consensus view of all points.
Dates and venues of the ninth special session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum and the twenty-fourth session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum
At the 10th plenary meeting, on 25 February 2005, the Council/Forum decided to hold its ninth special session in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from 7 to 9 February 2006, and its twenty-fourth session in Nairobi, Kenya, from 5 to 9 February 2007.
C. International environmental governance
By its decision 23/1, the Council/Forum decided to request the Executive Director to give high priority to the effective and immediate implementation of the Bali Strategic Plan for Technology Support and Capacity-building, as adopted by the same decision, to undertake as a matter of priority the necessary steps regarding coordination mechanisms, and to work out a resource-mobilization strategy and coordinate with other funding agencies, when appropriate, to ensure the immediate and sustained implementation of the Bali Strategic Plan.
It also decided to request the Executive Director to update his proposal for an “Environment Watch” framework, and to submit that update to Governments, for their views, so as to enable submission of a report to the Governing Council at its ninth special session.
It further decided to undertake the further review and consideration of the issue of universal membership of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum at its ninth special session in 2006, during the ministerial consultations, with a view to providing inputs as a contribution to the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.
Updated water policy and strategy of UNEP
By its decision 23/2, the Council/Forum decided to adopt the updated water policy and strategy as presented to it as a general framework and guidance for the activities of UNEP in the field of water and sanitation for the period 2005-2007; and to request that a draft updated water policy and strategy should be circulated by the ninth special session in order that a final draft may be circulated no later than September 2006 for consideration by the Council at its twenty-fourth session.
It also welcomed the generous offer of the Government of China to host the second Intergovernmental Review Meeting of the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities in 2006 and requested the Executive Director to proceed with organizing the second Intergovernmental Review Meeting.
E. Budget and programme of work for the biennium 2006-2007
By its decision 23/3, the Council/Forum decided to authorize the Executive Director, with a view to ensuring better conformity with the practices in other United Nations bodies, to reallocate resources between budget lines up to a maximum of 10 per cent of the appropriation to which the resources were reallocated; and to request that, should the Executive Director need to reallocate funds in excess of 10 per cent and up to 20 per cent of an appropriation, he do so in consultation with the Committee of Permanent Representatives.

H. Strengthening environmental emergency response and developing disaster prevention, preparedness, mitigation and early-warning systems in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster
By its decision 23/7, the Council/Forum decided to support the efforts of Governments and the international community to cooperate in the development of a worldwide early-warning system for natural and human-induced disasters through, among other things, a multimodal approach, and taking into consideration the framework of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction for all-hazards warning systems, which should include a tsunami early-warning system for the Indian Ocean and South-East Asian region and other areas potentially at risk, under the coordination of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.
It also decided to request the Executive Director to continue developing, in close consultation with Governments, relevant international institutions and secretariats of multilateral environment agreements, an environmental approach to the identification and assessment of areas which are potentially at risk from natural and human-induced disasters and guidelines outlining procedures and methodologies for environmental assessments of natural and human-induced disasters.
Environmental and equity considerations in the procurement practices of UNEP
By its decision 23/8, the Council/Forum decided to invite Governments to share with UNEP their experiences, lessons learned and best practices related to environmental and equity considerations in procurement practices.
It also decided to request the Executive Director to prepare a compilation report on environmental and equity considerations regarding current procurement practices in UNEP and an assessment of its performance and to present it to the Governing Council for its consideration at its twenty-fourth session.
J. Chemicals management
By its decision 23/9, the Council/Forum decided to request the Executive Director to make the necessary preparations for a third and final meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Development of a Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management, to be held in September 2005 in Vienna, and, in cooperation with the other co-conveners, for the International Conference on Chemicals Management which is envisaged to take place in conjunction with the ninth special session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum, in 2006, at which the Executive Director is to report on the outcomes of the process for developing the strategic approach to international chemicals management with a view to the Council/Forum considering its endorsement.
It also decided to assess at its twenty-fourth session the need for further action on mercury, considering a full range of options, including the possibility of a legally binding instrument, partnerships and other actions, on the basis of the progress report to be prepared by the Executive Director on the implementation of the same decision with regard to mercury.
Poverty and the environment
By its decision 23/10, the Council/Forum decided to request the Executive Director to enhance further the activities of UNEP in all regions to promote understanding of the linkages between poverty and the environment and, where appropriate, to assist Governments, upon their request, to integrate environmental decision-making into social and economic policy on poverty eradication.
Gender equality in the field of the environment
By its decision 23/11, the Council/Forum decided to invite Governments to promote methods of work conducive to women's participation in environmental decision-making at all levels with the aim of achieving broad gender balance and actively to involve all stakeholders in their gender-equality and environment-related activities.
It also decided to request the Executive Director to integrate further gender-equality and environment activities into the programme of work of UNEP and to invite the Executive Director, subject to availability of extrabudgetary resources, to explore options, in consultation with Governments, for the development of an action plan for gender mainstreaming within the work of the United Nations Environment Programme.
