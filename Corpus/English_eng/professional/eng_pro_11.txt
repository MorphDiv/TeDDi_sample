3.
The Board of Directors shall rule on financing operations submitted to it by the Management Committee.4.
The Management Committee shall examine whether financing operations submitted to it comply with the provisions of this Statute, in particular with Articles 16 and 18.

The Committee may make its favourable opinion subject to such conditions as it considers essential.
Where the Management Committee is against granting the finance, it shall submit the relevant documents together with its opinion to the Board of Directors.5.
Where the Management Committee delivers an unfavourable opinion, the Board of Directors may not grant the finance concerned unless its decision is unanimous.6.

interest received on loans granted by the Bank out of sums to be paid up by the Member States pursuant to Article 5;

Article 24
