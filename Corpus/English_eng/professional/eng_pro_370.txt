Reform of the Security Council
The General Assembly,
Reaffirming the aims and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations,
Recognizing that the international community has welcomed proposals for the reform of the United Nations as contained in the report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change entitled “A more secure world: our shared responsibility” and the report of the Secretary-General entitled “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all”,
Aware of the positive reactions of various regions, groups and individual countries to the proposals contained in the two reports, as reflected in the draft outcome document for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly to be held in September 2005, released by the President of the Assembly in June 2005,
Noting the common African position on the proposed reform of the United Nations as contained in the Ezulwini Consensus,
Convinced that the three categories of freedom, namely, freedom from want, freedom from fear and freedom to live in dignity, are essential for both developed and developing societies and indispensable for the peace and stability of the world,
Conscious that these freedoms can be upheld and protected by the world community only through an effective management of the current United Nations system,
Taking into account the need to strengthen United Nations institutions in order to enhance the efficiency of the organization, especially its principal organs and, in particular, the General Assembly and the Security Council,
Emphasizing the need to strengthen the General Assembly which should be made to function effectively as the main deliberative and representative organ of the United Nations,
Cognizant of the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security under the Charter of the United Nations,
Stressing the need to consider the views of all Member States on this all-important issue of the reform of the Security Council with a view to bringing to fruition ideas that have been the subject of several debates over the years,
Acknowledging the need for the Security Council to reflect present world realities and be more responsive to the aspirations of all States Members of the United Nations, bearing in mind the undeniable fact that in the year 1945, when the United Nations was being formed, most of Africa was not represented and that, as a result, Africa remains to this day the only continent without a permanent seat in the Council, which is the primary organ of the United Nations addressing matters of international peace and security,
Mindful of the need to ensure Africa, like all the other regions of the world, effective representation in the Security Council,
Realizing the need to engage fully all regions of the world in the work of the United Nations and to enlist their support for the progress of humanity,
Resolves to:
(a) Enlarge the Security Council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories and improve on its working methods;
(b) Accord the new permanent members the same prerogatives and privileges as those of the current permanent members, including the right of veto;
(c) Grant Africa two permanent and five non-permanent seats in the Security Council and increase its membership from fifteen to twenty-six with the eleven additional seats to be distributed as follows:
(i) Two permanent seats and two non-permanent seats for African States;
(ii) Two permanent seats and one non-permanent seat for Asian States;
(iii) One non-permanent seat for Eastern European States;
(iv) One permanent seat and one non-permanent seat for Latin American and Caribbean States;
(v) One permanent seat for Western European and other States;
(d) Amend the Charter of the United Nations accordingly.
