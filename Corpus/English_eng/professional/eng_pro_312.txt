Note verbale dated 24 June 2005 from the Permanent Mission of Costa Rica to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
The Permanent Mission of Costa Rica presents it compliments to the Secretary-General and has the honour to enclose the document entitled “Security Council enlargement and the cascade effect: enlargement of the permanent member category and its effects on the United Nations system”, prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship of Costa Rica, as a contribution to current efforts to reform and revitalize the Security Council and the United Nations at large (see annex).
The Permanent Mission of Costa Rica would like to request that the document be circulated as a document of the General Assembly under agenda items 53, 54 and 55.
Annex to the note verbale dated 24 June 2005 from the Permanent Mission of Costa Rica to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
Security Council enlargement and the cascade effect: enlargement of the permanent member category and its effects on the United Nations system
The present working paper is an effort to examine the possible effects of Security Council enlargement, in the Permanent Member category, on the opportunities for the broader membership to be represented in the various organs of the United Nations system.
It primarily concentrates on what is commonly known as the `Cascade Effect' and its collateral impact on the possibilities and opportunities of the broader membership to be elected to various United Nations organs.
The purpose of this paper is not to call into question the status or the privileges enjoyed by the current Permanent Members, although that is an issue that might deserve consideration in its own right, but only to sound a note of warning regarding the Cascade Effect as it would relate to any future enlargement in the Permanent Member category.
Costa Rica believes that it is necessary to seriously examine this issue, as any extension of the Cascade Effect could potentially affect the sense of collective ownership which necessarily underlies the United Nations.
The Cascade Effect arises from the structural political and legal advantages that Permanent Members enjoy as a result of their permanency in the Security Council.
In some cases, these electoral advantages are enshrined in legal norms, such as the requirement that judges to the International Court of Justice be simultaneously but separately elected by the General Assembly and the Security Council.
In other cases, they arise from collateral political influence, such as the customary practice that every Permanent Member is entitled to have at least one national appointed at the Under-Secretary-General level in key departments of the United Nations.
The statistical evidence presented below proves that Permanent Members in the Security Council have generally enjoyed continuous membership in all the key organs and subsidiary bodies of the United Nations system and have had the added benefit of having nationals continuously appointed to the most senior staff positions.
The limited exceptions are mostly confined to the transitional period regarding the representation of China (1960s and early 1970s) and to the adoption of voluntary rotation arrangements within the European Union (late 1990s).
For the broader United Nations membership, the Cascade Effect has a tangible negative impact.
By excluding, de iure or de facto, a certain number of seats from those available for open election and rotation, or appointment by the Secretary-General in the case of senior posts, the Cascade Effect substantially reduces the opportunities of Member States or their nationals to serve in various United Nations organs.
For all intents and purposes, Permanent Members of the Security Council displace all other Member States from seats and posts that should, respectively, be open to democratic election by Member States or appointment by the Secretary-General.
The precise impact of the Cascade Effect on each seat varies in relation to the total number of seats available for election in each organ.
Similarly, it varies on each post in relation to the total number of posts to be appointed by the Secretary-General.
Therefore, although comprehensive in its grasp, the Cascade Effect can manifest itself differently in each case.
When considering the expansion of the Security Council and, in particular, the possible creation of new Permanent Members, it is necessary to examine whether new Permanent Members would enjoy the advantages that arise from the Cascade Effect.
Without proper safeguards to correct the legal and political factors that give rise to it-- for example, a firm binding commitment otherwise,-- the Cascade Effect will, in all likelihood, extend its asphyxiating grasp on the opportunities and possibilities for the broader membership to be represented in the various organs of the United Nations system.
Statistical Findings
The Cascade Effect is a rather understudied phenomenon, although its ramifications can be felt throughout the United Nations system.
There have been few previous attempts to examine it (probably the most notable, albeit confined to an analysis of the 1984-1993 period, was submitted by Argentina during UNGA49 in 1995 and circulated as part of document A/49/965), and not a single attempt that comprehensively extrapolates its full force and scope since 1946.
Therefore, to fill in that void, the following analysis seeks to demonstrate, on a case by case basis, and in quantitative and comparative terms, the full force and scope of the Cascade Effect since 1946 and its probable future effects if there is an enlargement in the Permanent Member category.
For simplicity, the working paper takes enlargement in the Permanent Member category to mean 6 new additional Permanent Members as contemplated in Model A of the High-Level Panel Report “A More Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility” and the “In Larger Freedom” Report by the Secretary-General.
This should not be construed, in any way, as an endorsement of Model A.

5.1 General Committee
By virtue of resolution 33/138 of 1978, 5 of the 21 Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly are representatives of the Permanent Members and thereby members of the General Committee.
The compounded impact of the Cascade Effect, through the addition of 6 new Permanent Members as contemplated in Model A, is uncertain and cannot be easily ascertained in this case.
5.2 Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions [ACABQ]
With one exception (nationals from one Permanent Member did not serve between 1952-1971) and several minor gaps (2 one-year gaps, 6 three-year gaps, 1 four-year gap, and 1 five-year gap), nationals from Permanent Members have served continuously on the ACABQ since its creation in 1946.
Russian Federation 1946-2005 100.0%
United States 1946-1996, 2000-2005 94.9%
France 1946-1983, 1987-1989, 1993-1995, 1997-2002 84.7%
United Kingdom 1946-1980, 1984-1986, 1991-1993, 1999-2004 78.0%
China 1946-1951, 1972-1998, 2002-2005 61.1%
Of the 16 seats in the ACABQ, 5 [31.3%] seats are affected by the Cascade Effect.
This could increase to a total of 11 [68.7%] seats with the addition of 6 new Permanent Members as contemplated in Model A, reducing opportunities for the broader membership from 68.7% to 31.3% of the seats.
United Nations Secretariat
Permanent Members have customarily had one or more nationals serving in the most senior positions within the United Nations, typically at the Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General level.
Moreover, at times several nationals from a single Permanent Member have monopolized the most senior positions within a particular department, and at times a Permanent Member has traded off one department for another, as is evidenced in part by the following (this is not a comprehensive or exhaustive listing):
