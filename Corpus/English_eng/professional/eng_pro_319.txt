Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 113
Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations
Letter dated 29 June 2005 from the Charg√© d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Sao Tome and Principe to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly
I have the honour to write to you concerning our interest in requesting exemptions under Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations.
I wish to assure you at the outset that we are committed to meeting our financial obligations, despite the difficult challenges facing my country.
I believe, however, that because of the gravity of the matters before the Organization in the next few months, there are compelling reasons for granting such exemption.
It is clear that there is a mounting momentum for United Nations reform, as evidenced by the lively discussions in which Member States have been engaging under your leadership.
I am convinced that the decisions we make prior to and during the Summit in September are of historic importance.
I believe and I hope you will agree that Member States willing to participate in and contribute to deliberations on United Nations reform should not be excluded from the decision-making process.
I therefore wish to request the General Assembly to act expeditiously to grant an exemption under Article 19.
To that end, I would like to ask you to have this important matter taken up by the General Assembly in plenary session at the beginning of July, and to urge all Member States to act swiftly in the collective interest of the Organization.
(Signed) Domingos Ferreira Minister Counsellor
