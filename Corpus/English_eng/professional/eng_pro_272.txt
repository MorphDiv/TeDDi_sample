Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly on the programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.4/59/L.20 (A/C.5/59/28).
If the draft resolution recommended by the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) were adopted, the General Assembly would welcome the report submitted by the adviser to the Secretary-General (A/59/710) and endorse the proposals, recommendations and conclusions of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations contained in section II of the report on its 2005 resumed session (A/59/19/Add.1).
The Advisory Committee is aware of the serious time constraint the Secretariat faced in its attempt to prepare the statement now under consideration.
The Advisory Committee is also fully cognizant of the extreme importance of the matter now under discussion and in no way wishes to impede the effective implementation of urgent measures to ensure the elimination of future sexual exploitation and abuse.
Its observations and recommendations in the paragraphs below reflect this concern.
The Advisory Committee points out that resources the for 2005/06 period have been requested for personnel conduct functions in a number of the budgets for peacekeeping missions as well as the budget of the support account.
The Committee has commented extensively on this matter in its reports related to individual missions as well as in its general report on peacekeeping matters (A/59/736).
In its general report, the Committee drew attention to the fact that personnel conduct functions were included in peacekeeping budget proposals without the support of a larger review or policy framework, which is still in the process of development.
As stated in its general report, the Advisory Committee recognized that more systematic attention would need to be devoted to the full continuum of personnel conduct issues, including policy development, training, community relations, compliance supervision, investigations and accountability and discipline.
In the same report, the Committee also urged that proposals to strengthen those functions and improve their effectiveness take account of the fact that they are not inherently new and are closely linked to human resources management and to the leadership functions carried out by the heads of mission, the military and the police, as well as at Headquarters.
The Committee went on to note that guidelines had routinely been issued for civilian police, military observers and contingents, all of whom operated under their respective civilian police and military chains of command.
In this connection, the Advisory Committee draws attention to paragraph 27 of the report of the Special Committee, in which it noted the establishment by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of full-time personnel conduct officer positions in a number of peacekeeping missions and encouraged the continued development of that process with due attention to avoiding duplication of resources and functions.
Similarly, in paragraph 28 of its report, the Special Committee recommended that due attention be paid to avoiding duplication of resources and functions.
Resource proposals should be based on clear policy and should be explained; those elements appear to be lacking in the statement by the Secretary-General.
Moreover, such proposals should reflect the differing situations prevailing in each mission.
In this context, the Committee does not clearly understand the rationale for establishing a capacity at this stage in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), which is likely to wind up its activities in the near future.
Similarly, there is a need for further explanation of the level of capacity planned for the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), which is in the start-up phase.
The Advisory Committee regrets the marked absence in the statement of programme budget implications of the required investigative and related responsibilities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services.
The statement also did not include reference to the resources requested under the proposed support account budget for 2005/06.
The Committee was informed that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had entered into discussions with the Office of Internal Oversight Services to establish procedures with respect to the role of the Office in this area.
The Committee regrets the late engagement with the Office of Internal Oversight Services in view of its mandated investigative functions, as the General Assembly reconfirmed in its resolution 59/287.
In meetings with the Secretariat on the budgets of various peacekeeping missions, the Committee has consistently enquired as to the division of investigative responsibilities between the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in matters relating to sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.
To date, no satisfactory response has been provided.
In view of what has been stated above, the Advisory Committee believes that there is a need for the Secretariat to develop a well-defined, comprehensive and coherent policy, not only for peacekeeping, but for all other United Nations activities as well, both at Headquarters and in the field.
The policy should fully reflect the conclusions of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations as endorsed by the General Assembly, and it should include well-defined implementation procedures for enforcement and for ensuring accountability.
Based on that policy, there should be a proper analysis and presentation of resource requirements.
The Secretariat should justify requests for additional resources, bearing in mind the Special Committee's call to avoid duplication of resources and functions, and should clearly demonstrate that existing capacity and resources have been fully taken into account.
As stated in paragraph 4 above, the Advisory Committee does not wish to impede the speedy implementation of the measures called for in the draft resolution.
It therefore does not call for any reduction in the resources estimated by the Secretary-General as being required in connection with its adoption.
However, pending the development of the policy called for above and the preparation of fully justified proposals, the Advisory Committee recommends that the additional human resources requested in the current statement be provided through general temporary assistance, without prejudice to such decisions as the General Assembly may eventually take on specific requests for posts and related resources in the context of the relevant budgets.
In this connection, the Committee notes that, in most cases, the Secretariat has indicated its intention to accommodate the additional financial requirements from within the overall budgets concerned, reporting any additional requirements in the relevant performance reports.
Notwithstanding this intention, there are a number of proposals that would involve a need for the General Assembly to consider resources in addition to those requested in the peacekeeping budgets, which will be considered at its resumed fifty-ninth session (or, in the case of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), at the sixtieth session).
As indicated below, such resources would total $3,144,400 under the budgets for the support account and various peacekeeping missions.
Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the General Assembly that should it adopt draft resolution A/C.4/59/L.20, there would be no need for any additional appropriation at this stage.
However, there would be a need to consider requirements in the context of the proposed budgets of the support account and peacekeeping missions for 2005/06 as follows:
• Support account: an additional amount of up to $206,600
• UNAMSIL: an additional amount of up to $379,600
• MONUC: an amount of up to $1,353,000
• UNMIS: an amount of up to $1,205,200
