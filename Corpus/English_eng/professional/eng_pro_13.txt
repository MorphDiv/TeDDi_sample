PROTOCOL ON THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
CONSIDERING that, in accordance with Article III-434 of the Constitution, the Union shall enjoy in the territories of the Member States such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the performance of its tasks,
HAVE AGREED upon the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community:
CHAPTER I
PROPERTY, FUNDS, ASSETS AND OPERATIONS OF THE UNION
Article 1
The premises and buildings of the Union shall be inviolable.
They shall be exempt from search, requisition, confiscation or expropriation.
The property and assets of the Union shall not be the subject of any administrative or legal measure of constraint without the authorisation of the Court of Justice.
Article 2
The archives of the Union shall be inviolable.
Article 3
The Union, its assets, revenues and other property shall be exempt from all direct taxes.
The governments of the Member States shall, wherever possible, take the appropriate measures to remit or refund the amount of indirect taxes or sales taxes included in the price of movable or immovable property, where the Union makes, for its official use, substantial purchases the price of which includes taxes of this kind.
These provisions shall not be applied, however, so as to have the effect of distorting competition within the Union.
No exemption shall be granted in respect of taxes and dues which amount merely to charges for public utility services.
Article 4
The Union shall be exempt from all customs duties, prohibitions and restrictions on imports and exports in respect of articles intended for its official use.
Articles so imported shall not be disposed of, whether or not in return for payment, in the territory of the State into which they have been imported, except under conditions approved by the government of that State.
The Union shall also be exempt from any customs duties and any prohibitions and restrictions on import and exports in respect of its publications.
CHAPTER II
COMMUNICATIONS AND LAISSEZ-PASSER
Article 5
For their official communications and the transmission of all their documents, the institutions of the Union shall enjoy in the territory of each Member State the treatment accorded by that State to diplomatic missions.
Official correspondence and other official communications of the institutions of the Union shall not be subject to censorship.
Article 6
Laissez-passer in a form to be prescribed by a European regulation of the Council acting by a simple majority, which shall be recognised as valid travel documents by the authorities of the Member States, may be issued to members and servants of the institutions of the Union by the Presidents of these institutions.
These laissez-passer shall be issued to officials and other servants under conditions laid down in the Staff Regulations of officials and the Conditions of employment of other servants of the Union.
The Commission may conclude agreements for these laissez-passer to be recognised as valid travel documents within the territory of third States.
CHAPTER III
MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
Article 7
No administrative or other restriction shall be imposed on the free movement of members of the European Parliament travelling to or from the place of meeting of the European Parliament.
Members of the European Parliament shall, in respect of customs and exchange control, be accorded:
(a)
by their own governments, the same facilities as those accorded to senior officials travelling abroad on temporary official missions;
(b)
by the governments of other Member States, the same facilities as those accorded to representatives of foreign governments on temporary official missions.
Article 8
Members of the European Parliament shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties.
Article 9
During the sessions of the European Parliament, its members shall enjoy:
(a)
in the territory of their own State, the immunities accorded to members of their Parliament;
(b)
in the territory of any other Member State, immunity from any measure of detention and from legal proceedings.
Immunity shall likewise apply to members while they are travelling to and from the place of meeting of the European Parliament.
Immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found in the act of committing an offence and shall not prevent the European Parliament from exercising its right to waive the immunity of one of its members.
CHAPTER IV
REPRESENTATIVES OF MEMBER STATES TAKING PART IN THE WORK OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE UNION

Article 11
In the territory of each Member State and whatever their nationality, officials and other servants of the Union shall:
(a)
subject to the provisions of the Constitution relating, on the one hand, to the rules on the liability of officials and other servants towards the Union and, on the other hand, to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union in disputes between the Union and its officials and other servants, be immune from legal proceedings in respect of acts performed by them in their official capacity, including their words spoken or written.
They shall continue to enjoy this immunity after they have ceased to hold office;
(b)

(c)
in respect of currency or exchange regulations, be accorded the same facilities as are customarily accorded to officials of international organisations;
(d)
enjoy the right to import free of duty their furniture and effects at the time of first taking up their post in the State concerned, and the right to re-export free of duty their furniture and effects, on termination of their duties in that State, subject in either case to the conditions considered to be necessary by the government of the State in which this right is exercised;

Article 12
Officials and other servants of the Union shall be liable to a tax, for the benefit of the Union, on salaries, wages and emoluments paid to them by the Union, in accordance with the conditions and procedure laid down by a European law.
That law shall be adopted after consultation of the institutions concerned.
Officials and other servants of the Union shall be exempt from national taxes on salaries, wages and emoluments paid by the Union.
Article 13
In the application of income tax, wealth tax and death duties and in the application of conventions on the avoidance of double taxation concluded between Member States of the Union, officials and other servants of the Union who, solely by reason of the performance of their duties in the service of the Union, establish their residence in the territory of a Member State other than their State of domicile for tax purposes at the time of entering the service of the Union, shall be considered, both in the State of their actual residence and in the State of domicile for tax purposes, as having maintained their domicile in the latter State provided that it is a member of the Union.
This provision shall also apply to a spouse, to the extent that the latter is not separately engaged in a gainful occupation, and to children dependent on and in the care of the persons referred to in this Article.
Movable property belonging to persons referred to in the first paragraph and situated in the territory of the State where they are staying shall be exempt from death duties in that State.
Such property shall, for the assessment of such duty, be considered as being in the State of domicile for tax purposes, subject to the rights of third States and to the possible application of provisions of international conventions on double taxation.
Any domicile acquired solely by reason of the performance of duties in the service of other international organisations shall not be taken into consideration in applying the provisions of this Article.
Article 14
The scheme of social security benefits for officials and other servants of the Union shall be laid down by a European law.
That law shall be adopted after consultation of the institutions concerned.
Article 15
The categories of officials and other servants of the Union to whom Article 11, the second paragraph of Article 12, and Article 13 shall apply, in whole or in part, shall be determined by a European law.
That law shall be adopted after consultation of the institutions concerned.
