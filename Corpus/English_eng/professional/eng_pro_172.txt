Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, including special economic assistance
Letter dated 11 January 2005 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Indonesia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
I have the honour to refer to the special meeting of Association of South-East Asian Nations leaders in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami, which was held on 6 January 2005 in Jakarta.
The meeting, as you are aware, has resulted in a voice of solidarity in the international community to coordinate relief efforts for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the affected areas, fund-raising and mobilization, and to establish a regional early warning system in the Indian ocean and the South-East Asia region.
In this regard, I have the honour to transmit herewith the Declaration on Action to Strengthen Emergency Relief, Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and Prevention in the Aftermath of the Earthquake and Tsunami Disaster of 26 December 2004 (see annex).
I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly under agenda item 39.

Annex to the letter dated 11 January 2005 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Indonesia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
Special meeting of Association of South-East Asian Nations leaders in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami
Jakarta, 6 January 2005
Declaration on Action to Strengthen Emergency Relief, Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and Prevention in the Aftermath of the Earthquake and Tsunami Disaster of 26 December 2004
We, the Heads of State/Government, Special Envoys and heads of regional as well as international organizations, who gathered here on 6 January 2005 in Jakarta, Indonesia, expressed solemnly our profound sorrow and our solidarity to overcome the unprecendented catastrophe befalling the Indian Ocean rim countries on 26 December 2004.
This unprecedented devastation needs unprecedented global response in assisting the national Governments to cope with such disaster.
This would entail efforts in emergency relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction that may take five to ten years, with resources that cannot be borne by any individual country.
We deeply appreciate the generous contribution and assistance offered by many countries and the overwhelming expressions of support and assistance from Governments, non-governmental organizations and citizens of the world at large.
We applaud the leading role of the affected countries in addressing this disaster, and we recognize the role of the United Nations in assisting the affected countries' coordination of international assistance in the emergency relief phase.
We underlined the need to coordinate better and ensure that those contributions would be effective and sustainable, to truly address the suffering of the victims and to prevent such calamity from recurring.
We expressed our continuing commitment to assist the affected countries and their peoples in order to fully recover from the catastrophic and traumatic effects of the disaster, including in their mid- and long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts.
To these ends, we agreed to:
Emergency relief
(a) Urgently mobilize further additional resources to meet the emergency relief needs of victims in the affected countries;
(b) Request the United Nations to mobilize the international community to support the national relief emergency programmes in the affected countries, and welcomed in this regard, the flash appeal by the United Nations; in this connection, further request the United Nations to appoint a Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the above purpose; to convene an international pledging conference for the sustainability of humanitarian relief efforts; and to explore the establishment of “standby arrangements” at the global level for immediate humanitarian relief efforts;
(c) Strengthen coordination and cooperation of the national, regional and international relief efforts, to ensure effective and immediate distribution of the assistance;
(d) Support the efforts of the affected countries, as national coordinators, to ensure an effective channelling and utilization of assistance as offered by donor countries, international organizations and non-governmental relief organizations;
Rehabilitation and reconstruction
(a) Support and emphasize the importance of national rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes, given the devastation of the basic infrastructures and services in the affected countries.
The reconstruction and rehabilitation phase should link seamlessly with the humanitarian relief efforts;
(b) Call on the international community, in particular the donor countries, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, European Investment Bank and related international financial institutions, to provide the necessary funds for the viability and sustainability of those programmes;
(c) Establish a partnership, upon the request and with the leadership of the country concerned, involving donor countries and regional as well as international financial institutions, to support the respective national programmes of the affected countries;
(d) Welcome the initiative of several countries on the moratorium of payments of the external debt of the affected countries to augment their national capacity to carry out the rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts;
(e) Promote and encourage private sector participation in and contribution to the rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts;
Prevention and mitigation
(a) Support the decision of ASEAN to establish regional mechanisms on disaster prevention and mitigation, inter alia:
(i) The utilization of military and civilian personnel in disaster relief operations and an ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Centre, as provided for in the ASEAN Security Community Plan of Action;
(ii) ASEAN Disaster Information Sharing and Communication Network, as provided for in the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community component of the Vientiane Action Programme;
(iii) A regional instrument on disaster management and emergency response;
(b) A regional early warning system, such as a Regional Tsunami Early Warning Centre, in the Indian Ocean and the South-East Asia region.
