Sixtieth session
Item 69 of the provisional agenda*
Promotion and protection of the rights of children
Status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child
Report of the Secretary-General
Introduction
In its resolution 59/261 of 23 December 2004, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit to it at its sixtieth session a report on the status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto.
The present report is submitted in accordance with that request.
Status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child
As at 30 June 2005, the Convention on the Rights of the Child had been ratified or acceded to by 192 States.
In addition, two States had signed the Convention.1
As at 30 June 2005, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict had been ratified by 98 States and signed by 117 States and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography had been ratified by 95 States and signed by 111 States.2
Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child
At its sixty-first session, the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 2005/44 of 19 April 2005, entitled “Rights of the child”, in which it addressed the general topics of implementation of the Convention and other instruments; protection and promotion of the rights of the child; non-discrimination; protection and promotion of the rights of children in particularly difficult situations; the prevention and eradication of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; and protection of children affected by armed conflict.
With regard to the implementation of the Convention, the Commission urged States that had not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention and its Optional Protocols.
It urged States parties to take all appropriate measures for the implementation of the rights recognized in the Convention and noted the ongoing efforts of the Committee to reform its working methods so as to consider reports of States parties in a timely manner.
Finally, the Commission also recognized the need of States and other concerned parties for guidelines for the protection and alternative care of children without parental care.
During the reporting period, the Committee on the Rights of the Child held its thirty-seventh, thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth sessions, from 13 September to 8 October 2004, 10 to 28 January 2005 and 16 May to 3 June 2005, respectively,3 at the United Nations Office at Geneva.
In conformity with rule 75 of its provisional rules of procedure, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has decided periodically to devote one day of general discussion to a specific article of the Convention or to a theme related to the rights of the child in order to enhance understanding of the contents and implications of the Convention.
At its thirty-seventh session, the Committee devoted its day of general discussion to the theme, “Implementing child rights in early childhood”.
Following the general discussion, the Committee adopted a set of recommendations (see CRC/C/143, paras.
At its thirty-ninth session, the Committee adopted a decision on modalities related to the consideration of initial reports under the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
It also adopted new guidelines on the form and content of periodic reports submitted by States parties under article 44 paragraph 1 (b) of the Convention.
Those guidelines, which will come into force on 1 January 2006, will replace the earlier version of guidelines for periodic reports adopted by the Committee at its thirteenth session on 11 October 1996 (see CRC/C/58).
