The subprogramme will assist Governments to draw on the benefits of, and surmount the main challenges posed by, a multilateral rules-based trading system and to deepen and expand the economic integration processes through analytical and operational activities, including the preparation and dissemination of documents and technical reports and the promotion of technical discussions through panels and expert group meetings and the formulation and execution of technical cooperation projects and other capacity-building activities.
The strategy will devote special attention to assist member State stakeholders in: (a) assessing the key analytical and policy issues associated with the World Trade Organization negotiations and the proliferation of regional, subregional and bilateral trade agreements; (b) fulfilling commitments undertaken by signatory countries of various trade and integration agreements; and (c) strengthening their capacities to adapt to the new international environment, including the design of open-economy policies, the improvement of competitiveness and participation in the fastest growing segments of world trade.
Attention will also be given to building regional consensus on strategies for addressing the main constraints faced by the countries of the region seeking to derive full benefit from newly established competition and integration schemes and to the special situation of the smaller economies of the region.
Subprogramme 2 Production and innovation
Strategy
17.7 Substantive responsibility for the execution of this subprogramme rests with the Division of Production, Productivity and Management.
The strategy to be followed will take special account of the relevant provisions relating to the goals and targets set forth in the Millennium Declaration, in particular those related to the global partnership for development; the promotion of greater commitment to good governance, development and poverty reduction; and efforts to make available the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communication technologies (goal 8 and targets 12 and 18, respectively).
17.8 The strategy will include the generation and dissemination of economic analyses, policy proposals and relevant statistical information, with a view to fostering sectoral and enterprise development in the region providing technical advisory assistance and training services to policy makers and other relevant actors in the region, and promoting the sharing of experiences and best practices among them, including through the holding of expert group meetings.
While maintaining its focus on the more traditional agricultural and industrial sectors, the subprogramme will also place special emphasis on services sectors, particularly the emerging area of information and communications technologies, and on the social and environmental dimensions of productive development.
Subprogramme 3 Macroeconomic policies and growth
Strategy
17.9 Substantive responsibility for the execution of this subprogramme rests with the Economic Development Division.
It is expected that the Governments in Latin America and the Caribbean will continue to work towards consolidating macroeconomic stabilization.
Formidable challenges lie ahead, however, since the impact of past internal and external disequilibria and the vulnerability of the countries of the region to external shocks are expected to carry over into the future, thus reducing their manoeuvering room for the implementation of countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies.
The strategy will consist of continuing with the systematic monitoring of the region's macroeconomic performance with a view to providing timely and accurate information, analysis and options for short-term macroeconomic policy design.
The subprogramme will carry out research specifically designed to build its capacity to provide technical cooperation services and other collaboration to Governments, with a view to strengthening the type of long-term macroeconomic governance that is essential for the implementation of growth-oriented policies.
The subprogramme will also continue to promote policy harmonization in the context of regional integration and the wider framework of freer trade and increasing international economic integration.
This aim will be pursued through the organization of workshops, expert group meetings and other specialized forums for technical debate.
Subprogramme 4 Social development and equity
Strategy
17.10 Substantive responsibility for the execution of this subprogramme rests with the Social Development Division.
The strategy will consist of assisting Governments of ECLAC member States and other stakeholders in the area of social development to build their capacities to monitor the social situation and social trends, with a view to formulating and implementing policies, programmes and projects to attain the goal of poverty alleviation and social equity.
This strategy will set out to enable the countries of the region to analyse their own experiences by means of up-to-date diagnostic studies on social conditions, especially in relation to income distribution, educational and training resources and opportunities, poverty alleviation and access to social services and employment.
The strategy will also include the development of methodological inputs involving the use of sociocultural inclusion and exclusion indicators to complement economic and social indicators in the analysis of the asymmetrical effects of economic, social and sociocultural changes on well-being, particularly in the case of vulnerable population groups.
In addition, technical assistance and training activities will be carried out on the formulation, management and assessment of social policies, programmes and projects.
These activities will advocate the adoption of a rights-based approach to development in order to make social initiatives more responsive to social demands and more conducive to broader citizen participation.
Efforts will be made to promote the dissemination and exchange of information, experiences and good practices in the area of social policy, including through the holding of expert group meetings.
Subprogramme 5 Mainstreaming the gender perspective in regional development
Strategy
17.11 Substantive responsibility for the execution of this subprogramme rests with the Women and Development Unit of the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Commission.
The strategy of the subprogramme will consist of continuous support to the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean and its presiding officers.
Activities pertaining to cooperation for development will also be pursued in order to build the capacity of the member States of ECLAC to formulate public policies geared towards gender equality in the market, institutions and society at large.
These activities will include the provision of substantive and methodological training to national women's offices and sectoral ministries and institutions, in which a particular effort will be made to strengthen relations between civil society and Governments.
Headway will also be made in consolidating coordination among agencies of the United Nations system that conduct gender-related activities, both within the region and at the global level.
In addition, capacity-building for national institutions will be supported through research on gender relations in the region as a means to help those institutions to become better positioned to deploy their own efforts to deal with the most pressing challenges involved in combating poverty and achieving development with equity, as well as other challenges related to institutional affairs and political participation.
Lastly, the subprogramme will streamline the monitoring activities conducted by ECLAC in order to fully identify opportunities for mainstreaming the gender perspective into the substantive work of the Commission.
Subprogramme 6 Population and development
Strategy
17.12 Substantive responsibility for the implementation of this subprogramme rests with the Population and Development Division — Latin American and Caribbean Demographic Centre (CELADE).
The strategy for the subprogramme includes the provision of substantive and technical inputs to the countries of the region to promote the consideration of population variables in the formulation of their social programmes, especially those aimed at poverty alleviation and the reduction of social inequities.
The subprogramme will also support the efforts of member States to implement and monitor the commitments agreed upon at international conferences, in particular those related to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing of the Second World Assembly on Ageing, as well as the relevant goals and objectives of the Millennium Declaration.
Thus, the strategy involves: (a) performing policy-oriented research on key population issues; (b) developing and improving relevant methodologies and techniques for analysing population variables for use in social programming; (c) rendering technical assistance and advisory services to relevant institutions in the member States; (d) carrying out training activities on population-related matters for the benefit of policy makers and other relevant actors in the region; (e) fostering the sharing of experiences and good practices among countries of the region (including horizontal cooperation); and (f) disseminating information and knowledge on demographic subjects.
A key component of the strategy is continuing support to the activities of the sessional Ad Hoc Committee on Population and Development of the Commission.
The strategy also calls for continued close interaction with and technical support for relevant institutions and national counterparts in the region and for the strengthening and expansion of collaboration and cooperation with other international organizations working on population issues in the region.
Subprogramme 7 Planning of public administration
Strategy
17.13 Substantive responsibility for this subprogramme rests with the Latin American and Caribbean Institute for Economic and Social Planning, which acts as the Commission's training centre and plays a normative role in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of all training activities offered by the institution.
Efforts will be made to organize new training activities geared towards disseminating the Commission's views regarding challenges and potential development paths in the region among university graduate students and professors, academic circles and the media.
17.14 The strategy will centre on strengthening institutional capacities of ECLAC member States for public administration at the national and subnational levels, with regard to planning, budgeting and evaluation of current and capital expenditures as well as subnational development.
Particular attention will be paid to two basic subject areas: budgetary policies and public-sector management; and subnational development policies.
The first subject area continues to be assigned a high priority on the regional agenda.
The subject of subnational development policies has gained importance in the region, thanks to the progress made in implementing decentralization processes in countries with unitary government structures and the active debate in federally organized countries on how to redefine relationships among government organizations at different territorial levels.
17.15 The strategy will be implemented through: the organization and implementation of training courses and workshops designed to serve the needs of relevant national policy makers, civil servants and professional staff in the fields of concern; the servicing of intergovernmental and expert group meetings to provide forums of discussion and to promote the sharing of best practices and technical experiences among participants; and the provision of specialized advisory services and technical cooperation to government institutions on the various issues.
Subprogramme 8 Environment and human settlements
Strategy
17.16 Substantive responsibility for the execution of this subprogramme rests with the Sustainable Development and Human Settlements Division.
The strategy will aim to build the capacity of the Governments of the region and other relevant social stakeholders to assess the environmental impacts, costs and benefits of economic and social policies in the region.
To that end, steps will be taken to address the need for systematic, reliable and regularly updated databases and indicators for objectively measuring progress towards environmental sustainability.
A set of selected indicators will be designed and implemented to monitor current environmental sustainability trends in the region.
17.17 In addition, activities to follow up international and regional multilateral agreements will be carried out to support the countries of the region in formulating and designing environmental sustainability, land use and human settlements policies that are consistent with the goals set out in the Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).
Priority will also be given to the design and implementation of environmental fiscal policies, economic instruments for environmental management and mechanisms for financing sustainable environmental and urban development at the international, regional and national levels as well as to the analysis of the interaction between trade and the environment.
In view of the region's high urbanization indices, the strategy will also focus on national capacity-building for the design and implementation of sustainable development policies for land-use management.
17.18 The subprogramme will achieve these aims by preparing and disseminating analytical papers and technical reports and organizing training courses, expert meetings, seminars and workshops for the discussion of national and subregional policies and systems, with emphasis on strengthening the participation of private sector and civil society stakeholders.
It will also offer technical advisory services to the Governments of the region in the areas mentioned and will implement other technical cooperation activities for development geared to end-users.
Subprogramme 9 Natural resources and infrastructure
Strategy
17.19 Substantive responsibility for the execution of this subprogramme rests with the Natural Resources and Infrastructure Division.
The strategy will focus on strengthening the technical capacity of the countries of the region to implement and manage sustainable public policies that reconcile growth, the protection of the natural resource endowment and social equity with the sustainable use of natural resources.
Efforts will also be made to promote the integration of physical infrastructure to enhance the complementarity of the productive structures of the countries of the region and to improve the use of their resource endowment.
In this sense, the strategy will consist of furnishing the countries with analytical studies and systematized information on best practices applied in the region with respect to the regulation and management of natural resources and the provision of infrastructure and public utility services in the context of the goals and targets deriving from the Millennium Declaration.
Priority will be given to providing the countries with technical advisory services in the area of regulation, the management of mining, energy and water resources and the provision of infrastructure and public utility services as well as to promoting discussion forums to disseminate new policy options and lessons learned in terms of regulation and management, which will be supplemented by active participation in the physical integration efforts undertaken by the countries of the region.
In this regard, special attention will be paid to the follow-up to the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries.
Training activities for decision makers, public officials and specialists in the above-mentioned areas will also be offered under the subprogramme.
Subprogramme 10 Statistics and economic projections
Strategy
17.20 Responsibility for the implementation of this subprogramme rests with the Statistics and Economic Projections Division.
Given its interdisciplinary nature, the subprogramme will be executed in close collaboration with the other ECLAC divisions, to which it will continue to provide services.
The strategy will focus on strengthening the capacity of the national statistical systems of the region to produce and disseminate, in a timely manner and in keeping with international standards and best practices, the statistical information and indicators needed to design and monitor their economic and social policies.
This includes refining methodologies in the field of national accounts, statistics and projections and providing technical assistance and training to national statistical offices.
Activities in the economic field will include the incorporation of new dimensions relevant to the design and monitoring of development policy as well as expanding the time horizon of the models used for analysing alternative scenarios.
In the social field, activities will be undertaken to increase the scope of the measurement of well-being and relative poverty, with special attention to socio-economic vulnerability, exclusion and opportunities.
One of the central aims of the strategy is to continue to support and strengthen the activities of the Statistical Conference of the Americas of ECLAC, in particular in its efforts to harmonize and coordinate statistics in the context of regional integration schemes.
Subprogramme 11 Subregional activities in Mexico and Central America
Strategy
17.21 Substantive responsibility for this subprogramme rests with the ECLAC subregional headquarters in Mexico.
The strategy will aim at promoting cooperation among member States of the subregion and strengthening their capacity to formulate policies and strategies conducive to attaining the objective.
The strategy will centre on the generation, dissemination and application of innovative knowledge related to the development challenges and policy options facing the subregion through the preparation of research papers and technical reports, multisectoral and interdisciplinary analysis, data processing and systematization and analytical modelling.
Increased efforts will be made to work more closely with stakeholders and to take a results-based approach by providing advisory services, training and other technical cooperation and by organizing and promoting specialized forums to share experiences, best practices and lessons learned, with a view to fostering analytical and policy-oriented dialogue in the subregion.
Within this institutional framework, the strategy will seek to balance the dissemination of the substantive output and regional perspectives generated by the ECLAC system as a whole with a focus on the subregional dimension and the consideration of the unique needs and concerns of the countries of the subregion.
In addition, the subprogramme will continue to actively pursue consultation and to work closely with the specialized agencies and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant regional and international actors.
Subprogramme 12
Subregional activities in the Caribbean
Strategy
17.22 Substantive responsibility for this subprogramme rests with the ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean.
The strategy will aim at promoting cooperation among member States of the subregion and strengthening their capacity to formulate policies and strategies conducive to attaining the objective.
The strategy will thus centre on carrying out applied research related to the particular development challenges and policy options facing the Caribbean countries through the preparation and dissemination of analytical documents and technical reports.
In this regard, the focus will be on multisectoral and interdisciplinary analysis, data processing and systematization as well as the preparation of relevant economic and social statistics and indicators.
This will allow the subprogramme to continue to monitor economic and social trends in the subregion, including progress towards the implementation of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy and hemispheric integration.
The subprogramme will also follow up the implementation of the relevant international commitments agreed upon by the countries of the subregion within the framework of international conferences and world summits sponsored by the United Nations, including those related to the sustainable development of small island developing States, social development, gender equity and population and development.
In addition, the subprogramme will address issues of particular significance on the subregional agenda by providing advisory services, training and technical cooperation services to relevant stakeholders in member States, particularly policy makers, civil servants and specialized professional staff.
The strategy will also incorporate promotion and advocacy components and the organization of specialized forums to share experiences, best practices and lessons learned, with a view to fostering analytical and policy-oriented dialogue in the subregion.
The strategy is intended to balance the dissemination of the substantive output and regional perspectives generated by the ECLAC system as a whole with a focus on the subregional dimension and a consideration of the unique needs and concerns of Caribbean countries.

Programme 18
Economic and social development in Western Asia
Overall orientation
18.1 The overall orientation of programme 18 is to foster comprehensive, equitable, integrated and sustainable development and economic and social cooperation in the region and to maintain and strengthen economic relations between the member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) and other countries of the world.
ESCWA is responsible for the implementation of the programme.
18.2 Policy direction for the programme is provided in Economic and Social Council resolutions 1818 (LV) of 9 August 1973 and 1985/69 of 26 July 1985, establishing ESCWA and amending the terms of reference to underscore the social functions of the Commission.
Further direction is provided in ESCWA resolution 220 (XX) of 27 May 1999, on the adoption, by ESCWA member countries, of the Beirut Declaration, which envisioned an enhanced role for the Commission at the regional level; and, by the recommendation of the Commission at its twenty-first session (May 2001) that activities focus on a limited number of priorities, on Arab regional integration and on the study of mechanisms that would activate such integration.
The internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992, dealing with such matters as trade, sustainable development, social development, finance, and information and communication technologies, provide further policy direction to the programme.
18.3 In the biennium 2006-2007, ESCWA will reinforce the orientation set out in the reform and restructuring effort undertaken in 2002-2003 to achieve its full potential and reap the benefits in terms of improved programme outcomes.
The key priority areas identified at that time — globalization and regional integration, social policies, water and energy, and information and communication technologies — remain valid and are reflected in the strategic framework.
Attention should be focused on Arab regional integration and the study of mechanisms that would activate this integration and on reviewing the existing organizational structure of the secretariat in order best to serve Arab integration.
These priorities both are an integral part of the global agendas and are region-specific.
18.4 Overall, the programme seeks to promote successful outcomes in the countries of Western Asia in key areas of the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.
The programme is structured around seven interdependent and complementary subprogrammes, which, on the basis of core analytical and normative work and through regional coordination and cooperation, aim in particular, on the request of member countries, to enhance capacity development so as to assist in building consensus and negotiating agreements in global and regional forums and to assist in formulating, implementing and monitoring policies, strategies, programmes and measures and in establishing and managing related mechanisms.
A salient feature of the strategy is to strengthen the capacity of member countries to prepare for, monitor and follow up progress towards internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992 with a view to achieving agreed goals and targets.
Other important elements are awareness-raising, policy dialogue, advocacy and advice, knowledge-sharing and networking, training and technical support and, importantly, assisting member countries in coping with the multidimensional requirements of globalization by fostering competitiveness on the basis of economic efficiency and the acquisition of the requisite technological skills, advising them on the integration of the human and social dimensions of development into their policies by focusing on capacity-building with regard to human resources and proposing mechanisms through which to identify the specifications and qualifications required of human resources that would enable member countries to become the driving force of social and economic development.
18.5 As the Western Asia region continues to be beset by instability and wanting for peace, ESCWA will continue to give special emphasis to countries emerging from conflict and the governance of recovery, pursuant to ESCWA resolution 241 (XXII).
The recent evolving situation in the region requires flexibility to quickly respond to emerging issues, such as youth employment.
18.6 To ensure system-wide coherence, ESCWA will undertake its work in close cooperation and coordination with other United Nations entities, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO).
As an active member of the Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, ESCWA will devote attention to ensuring clarity in the roles and responsibilities of global and regional bodies with regard to follow-up on internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.
ESCWA will continue to collaborate with regional and national organizations, as well as with civil society and the private sector.
Subprogramme 1 Integrated policies for the management of regional resources for sustainable development
Strategy
18.7 The ESCWA region is suffering from a scarcity of water resources and their inefficient use, which is manifested in wasteful consumption patterns, particularly in the agricultural sector.
The region also suffers from disputes over rights to shared water resources.
On the other hand, the abundance of fossil fuel energy in some member countries has encouraged unsustainable production and consumption patterns that have an adverse impact on the environment.
Also, the rural areas have limited access to energy services.
The production sectors suffer from low productivity and weak competitiveness, due mainly to the inefficient use of resources, insufficient networking and clustering and poor use of technology.
Costs of environmental protection have not yet been fully taken into consideration in the production process.
18.8 This subprogramme, which is under the responsibility of the Sustainable Development and Productivity Division, will concentrate on facilitating the formulation and implementation of sustainable development strategies, policies and programmes and on assisting member countries in their follow-up to the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and in achieving its targets, as well as the Millennium Development Goals and targets, especially target 9, on integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes and reversing the loss of environmental resources, and target 10, on sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation, of goal 7, on ensuring environmental sustainability.
The subprogramme will continue to serve as a forum for promoting policy dialogue as a means to reach common positions and enhance synergies among the countries of the region; facilitate regional cooperation, particularly in the management of shared water resources, and enhance negotiation skills to prevent disputes; support national and regional capacity-building in priority areas of sustainable development, especially in the fields of integrated management of water resources and energy efficiency; facilitate the establishment and coordination of mechanisms for monitoring and reporting on environmental issues; assist small and medium-sized enterprises through clustering and networking and improving their use of technology; and improve linkages between technology and sectoral development in order to harness the efforts of individual member countries so as to enhance competitiveness and turn innovations into an effective vehicle for development.
Efforts will be made to assist member countries in filling the gaps in vertical chains and/or in introducing knowledge-based high-tech industries by promoting development of the production and service sectors in order to achieve maximum value added, competitiveness and sustainability in the economies of member countries and the region.
Measures to facilitate capacity-building will be identified in order to enhance the productivity, competitiveness and environmental compatibility of service, industrial and agricultural outputs.
This will be achieved by undertaking research and analytical studies, convening meetings and seminars, disseminating best practices and building capacity through workshops and advisory services on priority sustainable development issues related to water, energy, the environment and the production sectors.
Subprogramme 2 Integrated social policies
Strategy
18.9 The ESCWA member countries are confronted by political instability, an imbalance in the provision of basic social services between urban and rural areas and between the different social strata and widening disparities in income distribution, associated with increasing poverty and unemployment.
National social policies are often conflicting and seldom harmonized and are frequently formulated and implemented, in some member countries, with little input from local communities or civil society institutions.
They do not foster a rights-based approach to development.
Development potential is further impeded by the failure to develop human capital, notably youth, women and vulnerable and disadvantaged social groups such as the disabled and victims of conflict.
18.10 In 2006-2007, the strategy of this subprogramme, which is under the responsibility of the Social Development Division, is to shift the focus from the sectoral approach of 2002-2003 and build on advocacy for integrated social policies in 2004-2005 by enhancing the capacity of member States, at their request, to formulate integrated social policies.
There will be increased emphasis on assisting member countries in the implementation of the plans of action of the global conferences and Millennium Development Goals (1, 4, 5 and 8); supporting member countries in strengthening institutions and the capacity of national and regional mechanisms, leading to integrated regional responses and concerted actions; assisting member countries in formulating integrated policy action with particular regard to poverty and unemployment reduction, with a focus on youth, women and the disabled; supporting member countries and local authorities in formulating appropriate, innovative and integrated policies and programmes on population and development; improving the physical environment and advocating partnerships between governments and municipalities; increasing capacity for popular participation in urban development at the local level, particularly in cities and other urban areas; and assisting in post-conflict recovery measures.
The subprogramme will continue to serve as a forum for promoting policy dialogue and networking, increasing popular participation and providing technical cooperation, including advisory services on various social issues and on the production and dissemination of gender-sensitive social statistics and indicators.
Subprogramme 3 Economic analysis and forecasting for regional development
Strategy
18.11 The region is suffering from low rates of economic growth and investment, resulting in high unemployment rates, particularly among youth.
During the past quarter of a century, several countries in the region have experienced war and civil conflict, resulting in the destruction of physical productive capacities and infrastructure, as well as a significant weakening of institutional and human resource capacities.
For other member countries, the prevailing atmosphere of great economic and political uncertainty within the region has undermined prospects for steadier development, high rates of investment and productivity growth.
As market size has been constricted and intraregional integration has faced obstacles, economic growth rates have remained low and obstacles and barriers to participation in the multilateral trading system remain.
18.12 The strategy of this subprogramme, which is under the responsibility of the Economic Analysis Division, includes two new elements, namely, advocacy for the coordination of macroeconomic policies among the countries of the region and the provision of assistance on macroeconomic issues and policies to countries emerging from conflict.
Other elements of the strategy include (a) enhancing policy-making options through economic projections and forecasts; (b) in-depth analyses of economic developments and trends; (c) analysis of the main trends in the performance of production sectors; and (d) analysis of fiscal and monetary developments and policies, including trends in foreign and domestic debt and trends in the environment of increased competitiveness.
A greater effort will be made to provide quality advisory services in economic policy to complement analytical work.
The subprogramme will use quantitative techniques and produce impact analyses and continue to analyse issues of uncertainty and risk that affect investment, economic growth and unemployment.
Subprogramme 4 Regional integration and responding to globalization
Strategy
18.13 Despite the various efforts made towards regional integration among member States in the 1950s, the basic requirements for achieving economic integration have not been established.
In a world moving increasingly towards the establishment of large economic blocs, regional economic integration becomes a matter of vital importance.
Two major impediments to regional and international integration and increased competitiveness are backwardness of the transport sector and obstacles and barriers to participation in the multilateral trading system.
Most ESCWA member countries were latecomers to the multilateral trading system and need to adapt and cope with its requirements to avoid marginalization and increase their competitiveness.
Furthermore, the region, in general, has not succeeded in mobilizing sufficient financial resources for development needs.
18.14 The strategy of this subprogramme, which is under the responsibility of the Globalization and Regional Integration Division, will be to develop the mechanism for implementing the agreements on the integrated transport system in the Arab Mashreq and monitor their implementation.
After developing the road and railway transport agreements, the subprogramme will endeavour to reach an agreement on maritime transport and facilitate measures for air transport in the region.
Emphasis will also be placed on strengthening the negotiation skills of member States in respect of the WTO negotiation process, continuing to increase their understanding of the opportunities and challenges presented by WTO as well as regional integration agreements, defining obstacles and barriers to participation in the multilateral trading system and organizing awareness drives on the role of the Arab free-trade area and other bilateral agreements.
Furthermore, the subprogramme will continue to assist member countries, at their request, in implementing the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development.
Support will be provided in enhancing regional development by analysing existing credit and investment policies and formulating specific recommendations for the improvement of existing investment laws, regulations and incentives in order to increase significantly the attractiveness of member countries to domestic and foreign investors, with particular emphasis on intraregional capital flows and the return of capital invested outside the region.
The subprogramme will facilitate dialogue among member countries as a means of reducing differences and reaching common positions; increase understanding by undertaking research and analytical studies, convening meetings and disseminating best practices; and build capacity through workshops and advisory services.
Subprogramme 5 Information and communication technology for regional integration
Strategy
18.15 Western Asia suffers from a widening digital divide: at the internal level, between Gulf and other member countries, on the one hand, and between cities and rural areas, on the other; and externally, between the region and other regions of the world.
Currently, information and communication technology indicators for the region as a whole are lower than world averages.
At the same time, the region has development potential that needs to be exploited in building the information society, particularly in terms of the common language and cultural heritage.
Greater efforts need to be deployed in increasing literacy and education levels and tapping human resources and talents, especially among women and the growing youth population.
18.16 Through regional preparations for the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, the subprogramme, for which the Information and Communication Technology Division is responsible, will serve as a forum for dialogue to adopt joint positions and formulate harmonized policies and strategies on information and communication technologies so as to enhance socio-economic development and increase regional integration among member States.
It is imperative to raise awareness of the need to move towards a knowledge-based economy, as well as of the importance of regional collaboration and partnership in building the information society, building institutional capacity in information and communication technology, enhancing digital Arabic content and developing the information and communication technology sector.
The subprogramme will contribute to the establishment of coordination and cooperation mechanisms between regional players, both private and public, engaged in information and communication technology development activities and to the creation of new partnerships.
Research, analytical studies, meetings, knowledge networking and advisory services will contribute to this endeavour.
Pilot projects for employment creation and poverty reduction through information and communication technology will also be launched and their best practices disseminated in the region.
Support will be provided to member countries in the context of a regional plan of action for building the information society that respects the particularities and linguistic and cultural priorities of the region.
Subprogramme 6 Comparable statistics for improved planning and decision-making
Strategy
18.17 ESCWA countries are faced with the challenge of producing and disseminating data and statistics that are comparable and timely to respond to their national and the international development agendas.
Better harmonization of statistics through the adoption of international standards and concepts is essential for enhancing the quality of these data and making them available for use by policy makers and analysts in member countries.
18.18 The Statistics Coordination Unit will coordinate the statistical functions within ESCWA.
Each of the substantive divisions of ESCWA will implement the statistical component that is related to its mandate.
18.19 The subprogramme will be oriented towards assisting member countries, at their request, in implementing international standards and improving the consistency and reliability of national statistics.
It will increase the capacity of member countries to produce gender-disaggregated statistics and indicators and monitor progress towards achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals.
It will also assist the countries of the region in adopting and applying the scientific standards employed internationally for amassing, analysing and disseminating statistical data and indicators, with a view to enabling those countries to formulate economic and social policies and monitor progress towards the achievement of national development objectives.
A variety of modalities, including publications, meetings, workshops and advisory services, will be employed to build national capacities.
Greater effort will be made to increase the electronic dissemination of statistics and indicators.
Subprogramme 7 Advancement and empowerment of women
Strategy
18.20 The region is characterized by low rates of women's participation in the economic, social and political domains, despite their increased educational levels.
Although the constitutions of most ESCWA countries recognize women's equal civil and political rights, this has not been translated in practice into women's full realization of their civic, legal and political rights.
The political participation rate of women is one of the lowest in the world.
The participation of civil society institutions in policy dialogue at the regional level, as well as their contribution to the implementation of recommendations of global conferences, and the monitoring thereof, is rather modest.
18.21 This subprogramme reflects the determination of ESCWA to increase its focus on women's issues and ameliorate the status and participation of women in the region, pursuant to ESCWA resolution 240 (XXII) of April 2003.
The ESCWA Centre for Women, which serves as the secretariat of the Committee on Women, will assume a major role in the region in assisting in gender mainstreaming, empowering women and promoting gender equality.
It will also strive to promote partnerships between governments and civil society institutions.
18.22 To achieve its objective, the subprogramme will pursue the strategy of raising awareness and understanding of women's issues and of the vital role of non-governmental organizations in this respect; promoting dialogue on critical areas of concern for the advancement of women and for fostering partnerships between civil society institutions and governments; facilitating the reaching of common regional positions with regard to women's issues; assisting member countries in formulating realistic action-oriented gender equality policies; and promoting gender mainstreaming.
The subprogramme will also monitor developments with respect to the status of women and will evaluate indicators and statistics with a view to assisting member countries, at their request, to formulate an integrated policy for the advancement and empowerment of women in the region.
This will be achieved by complementing normative activities with the provision of technical assistance, including advisory services, to member countries and civil society institutions.

Overall orientation
19.1 The purpose of the United Nations human rights programme is to promote universal enjoyment of all human rights by giving practical effect to the will and resolve of the world community as expressed by the United Nations.
Its mandate derives from Articles 1, 13, 55 and 62 of the Charter of the United Nations; the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights and subsequently endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/121 of 20 December 1993; the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as defined in resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993; international human rights instruments adopted by the United Nations; the outcomes of relevant United Nations conferences and summits; and the resolutions and decisions of policy-making bodies, including, in particular, General Assembly resolutions 55/2 of 8 September 2000 on the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 56/95 of 14 December 2001 on the follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit and 57/300 of 20 December 2002 on strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change.
The programme is based on the principles and recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.
19.2 The programme is under the responsibility of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who performs her or his functions under the direction and authority of the Secretary-General, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/141.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) acts as the focal point for and provides the leading role on all human rights activities of the United Nations.
19.3 The Office will continue to strive for the universal realization of all human rights for all through the implementation of the Charter's provisions on human rights and of the international human rights instruments adopted by the United Nations.
The decisions of policy-making organs will guide this effort.
Emphasis will be placed on the enhancement of cooperation at the international, regional and national levels, keeping in mind the values of the Millennium Declaration, which calls for promoting democracy and strengthening the rule of law and respect for all internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development.
Priority will continue to be given to emphasizing the importance of human rights on international and national agendas, upholding the principle of equality and non-discrimination, combating discrimination on grounds of race, sex, language or religion, advancing the rights of children and women, spreading education about human rights at all levels of education, responding to the needs of the vulnerable for protection, and addressing situations of international concern identified by the Commission on Human Rights and other relevant United Nations organs.
19.4 Increased support will be provided to Member States, at their request, in national capacity-building, human rights education and training through advisory services, technical cooperation activities and field activities and operations.
All human rights will be addressed in an integrated, interrelated and interdependent manner by stimulating and coordinating action across the United Nations system.
The Office of the High Commissioner will continue to provide support to human rights organs and treaty-monitoring bodies and to support efforts to strengthen, rationalize and streamline the United Nations machinery in the field of human rights, as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/141, and work with United Nations partners to increase support for national human rights capacity-building.
OHCHR will continue to take gender fully into account in the development and application of norms and procedures so that violations against women and girls are clearly identified and protection is offered under law.
It will also seek to increase awareness and understanding of human rights issues.
19.5 The OHCHR strategy will be guided by the lessons learned from the 2002-2003 biennium, in particular with regard to reflecting measurements of achievement that can be realistically implemented by the Secretariat.

Protection of and assistance to refugees
Overall orientation
4 Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-seventh Session, Supplement No. 12 A (A/57/12/Add.1), annex IV.
20.1 The overall objective of this programme is to provide international protection to refugees and others of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and to seek permanent solutions to their problems, as well as to ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance to them.
Assistance is one aspect of international protection and is a means of facilitating it.
It is rooted in and grows out of the protective nature of the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
In its operational activities, UNHCR seeks to integrate protection and humanitarian assistance.
The pursuit of durable solutions to the problems of refugees is the heart of protection and the principal purpose of this programme.
The framework for the provision of international protection was further spelled out in the “Agenda for Protection” endorsed by the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and welcomed by the General Assembly in 2002.4
20.2 The mandate for the programme is contained in General Assembly resolution 319 A (IV), by which the Assembly established UNHCR as from 1 January 1951, and resolution 428 (V), which sets out the statute of the Office.
The Assembly has also called upon the High Commissioner to ensure that returnees receive assistance to help in their sustainable reintegration, as well as to monitor their safety and well-being on return (see resolution 40/118).
In addition, on the basis of specific requests from the Secretary-General or the competent principal organs of the United Nations, and with the consent of the State concerned, UNHCR provides humanitarian assistance and protection to internally displaced persons (see resolution 48/116), working in cooperation with the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator (see resolution 58/153).
As regards the assistance activities of UNHCR, the basic provisions of the statute were expanded by the Assembly in its resolution 832 (IX).
Through the adoption by the Assembly of its resolution 58/153 of 22 December 2003 on implementing actions proposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to strengthen the capacity of his Office to carry out its mandate, the Office was given a renewed mandate to address the challenge of forced displacement through a mission based on a spirit of solidarity, responsibility and burden-sharing, with an abiding commitment to make the Office a truly multilateral institution.
20.3 The international legal basis for the protection of refugees finds its principal expression in the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto.
In addition, there are a number of other international instruments of relevance, such as the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child.
At the regional level, there are also important instruments and declarations, such as the Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa of the Organization of African Unity, the Cartagena Declaration on Refugees, adopted by the Colloquium on the International Protection of Refugees in Central America, Mexico and Panama, and the San José Declaration on Refugees and Displaced Persons.
20.4 UNHCR is responsible for the implementation of the programme.
20.5 The overall strategy that will be followed consists of a range of activities undertaken in cooperation with States and various organizations and pursued with a continued strong emphasis on improving efficiency, transparency and accountability, especially through the development of an integrated operations management system.
Notable among them are the following:
(a) The pursuit of comprehensive strategies, in cooperation with States and organizations as and when appropriate (“Convention Plus Agreements”), aimed at mitigating and preventing the causes of forced population movements as well as finding solutions to them when they occur;
(b) The ongoing development of a legal regime of international protection, in particular through the promotion of accessions to international and regional instruments relating to the status of refugees or otherwise benefiting refugees, the effective implementation of refugee rights and the promotion and dissemination of refugee law and protection principles;
(c) The further development of contingency planning, emergency preparedness and response capabilities, in coordination with other organizations, so as to respond effectively and efficiently to situations of forced human displacement;
(d) Ensuring that UNHCR and its partners provide humanitarian assistance in an environmentally sensitive manner and in such a way that it is supportive of and reinforces development initiatives to the extent possible;
(e) Ensuring that UNHCR and its partners incorporate into all aspects of its protection programmes and the delivery of humanitarian assistance the particular needs and capacities of refugee women and elderly refugees and the special needs of refugee children and adolescents;
(f) The further development, in consultation with concerned parties, of options to ensure the security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements as well as security in areas of return and to explore further concrete ways of enhancing the safety and security of UNHCR staff and other humanitarian workers working with refugees and returnees.
In this regard, due consideration should be given to the obligation of United Nations officials, in the conduct of their duties, to observe fully both the laws and regulations of Member States and their duties and responsibilities to the Organization;
(g) The systematic follow-up to relevant recommendations in the plans of action emanating from recent and upcoming international conferences;
(h) The involvement, as soon as possible, of other humanitarian and development organizations, both national and international, in providing assistance to refugees and host communities and in the search for durable solutions.
20.6 The programme is under the intergovernmental guidance of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in accordance with its terms of reference, as contained in General Assembly resolution 1166 (XII).
Subprogramme 1 International protection
Strategy
20.7 This subprogramme falls under the overall responsibility of the Department of International Protection.
The overall objective is multifaceted and will be pursued in a number of ways.
Further accessions to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees as well as to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness will be promoted.
The monitoring of the observance by States of internationally accepted standards for the treatment of refugees, especially the fundamental principles of asylum and non-refoulement, will contribute to ensuring the effective implementation of refugee rights by the States concerned.
This will involve working especially for the establishment by States of fair and efficient procedures for the determination of refugee status or, as appropriate, other mechanisms to ensure that persons in need of international protection are identified and granted such protection, and to ensure that all persons seeking international protection are granted access to those procedures and mechanisms.
To ensure a more effective response to the protection needs of refugee women, children and adolescents, a more concerted effort to mainstream the policies and guidelines relating to refugee women, children and adolescents will be continued through the work of specially trained interdisciplinary UNHCR country teams.
The promotion and dissemination of refugee law and protection principles, particularly through training, in cooperation with non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and other relevant organizations of governmental and non-governmental officials will be another means of achieving the stated objective.
In addition, when, on the basis of a specific request of the Secretary-General or a competent principal organ of the United Nations, and with the consent of the State concerned, UNHCR provides protection to internally displaced persons, it will do so on the basis of criteria enumerated in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and in close collaboration with other concerned entities and agencies.
To revitalize old partnerships and build new ones in support of the international refugee protection system, efforts to promote collaboration on refugee protection with a wide range of actors, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, will be continued.
In order to find permanent solutions to the problems of refugees, efforts will be made to promote the development of more comprehensive and regional approaches, as and when appropriate, in the form of “Convention Plus Agreements”, to resolving refugee situations.
Subprogramme 2 Assistance
Strategy
20.8 The subprogramme is under the responsibility of the Department of Operations, which embraces the various regional operations.
UNHCR will engage in a number of strategies.
It is concerned that assistance, whenever possible, should be delivered in such a way that it involves the recipients and taps their potential.
This participatory approach will be part of a broader situation analysis which will also include improved demographic data deriving from the new registration tools (resulting from Project Profile in 2004-2005) and the use of the standards and indicators for the sectors as established in the practical guide to the systematic use of standards and indicators in UNHCR operations.
This approach should lead to a significant improvement in the quality of the Office's assistance programmes, especially for refugee women, children and the elderly.
20.9 In providing assistance, UNHCR will aim to enhance the self-reliance of returnees and, where feasible, that of refugees rather than increasing their dependency.
UNHCR, in close cooperation with its partners, has developed a framework for durable solutions.
This framework will aim to ensure that the Office's assistance activities are directed towards a durable solution to the plight of refugees.
It will focus, as appropriate, on the following elements: (a) the promotion of development and humanitarian assistance for refugees through better targeting of such assistance to countries and areas hosting large numbers of refugees over protracted periods; (b) the establishment of so-called “4Rs” programmes for returnees and internally displaced persons of concern to UNHCR.
These will ensure the linkages between repatriation, reintegration, rehabilitation and reconstruction.
Using a country-specific approach, the programmes will provide an overarching framework for institutional cooperation between UNHCR and its development partners and are an integral part of transition strategies; and (c) the promotion of a relevant strategy of development in those areas where local integration of refugees is acceptable to the host countries.
Work to implement this framework will be pursued, inter alia, through the Office's membership in the United Nations Development Group.
To anchor the return of those forcibly displaced to their communities of origin, the Office will continue to ensure linkages between broader development efforts and humanitarian assistance.
In that regard, UNHCR, when formulating programmes, will work closely with development entities and international financial institutions to ensure a comprehensive approach to programme planning.

Programme 21
Palestine refugees
Overall orientation
21.1 The General Assembly, by its resolution 302 (IV) of 8 December 1949, established the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) as a separate entity within the United Nations system and mandated it to provide continued assistance for the relief of Palestine refugees.
Since starting its work in 1950, UNRWA has become the largest operational agency in the Middle East, demonstrating its capacity to adapt and enhance its programmes as required to meet the evolving needs of refugees and to cope with developments in the region.
It stands ready to continue doing so during the biennium 2006-2007 in accordance with the triennial mandate it receives from the General Assembly, the most recent of which was resolution 56/52 of 10 December 2001, by which the Assembly extended UNRWA's mandate until June 2005.
21.2 UNRWA reports directly to the General Assembly.
Overall review of UNRWA programmes and activities is undertaken by the 10-member Advisory Commission, which includes representatives of the Agency's major donors and host Governments.
In its resolution 3331 B (XXIX) of 17 December 1974, the General Assembly decided that, with effect from 1 January 1975, the expenses relating to the emoluments of international staff in the service of UNRWA, which would otherwise have been charged to voluntary contributions, should be financed by the regular budget of the United Nations for the duration of the Agency's mandate.
21.3 The strategic objectives of UNRWA for the biennium 2006-2007 are to sustain its investment in the human resources of Palestine refugees, to support the social and economic development of their communities and to provide targeted relief and support for refugees experiencing special hardship.
The Agency also provides emergency assistance to vulnerable refugee communities in situations of acute distress.
Beginning in 2000, over and above its regular services to refugees, the Agency provided emergency assistance to over 1.2 million refugees affected by the strife in the occupied Palestinian territory.
It plans to continue these services as necessary.
Should the strife in the occupied Palestinian territory continue or intensify, the deteriorating economic conditions of the refugees, the restrictions on the flow of goods, services and staff members and the heavy demands of emergency operations on staff will affect service provision to the refugees.
21.4 During 2006-2007, UNRWA will also provide, on an exceptional basis, services to the non-refugee poor living within refugee communities, in keeping with past practice.
Under the responsibility of its Commissioner-General, UNRWA aims to achieve its objectives by maintaining provision of a targeted blend of education, health, relief, social and microfinance services to eligible Palestine refugees.
Eligible registered Palestine refugees, who are located in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, are projected to number some 4.4 million in 2006.
Gender issues remain a major concern of the Agency in all its programme areas.
In 2006-2007 UNRWA will build on key achievements in this area by further developing its gender-mainstreaming practices.
A key activity in this regard is the development and implementation, during the biennium 2004-2005, of an Agency-wide gender strategy, through which the Agency expects to realize identifiable accomplishments in 2006-2007.
21.5 The Palestine refugees rely on the Agency to provide a range of basic services for their well-being.
The Agency, which is entirely dependent on voluntary funding to implement its programmes, and which has contended with chronic funding shortfalls in recent years, will continue to maintain efficient and cost-conscious management and to carry out strategic planning and programme assessments, as necessary, in order to preserve the quality and scope of its services for a rapidly growing refugee population.
To engage the international community on, inter alia, ensuring funding and UNRWA programme needs, the Agency is planning a major international conference to be hosted by the Government of Switzerland in June 2004.
Furthermore, in early 2004, the Agency prepared a five-year strategic plan (2004-2008) to identify the activities and resources necessary to upgrade services and rehabilitate infrastructure.
In each subprogramme area, including general education and technical and vocational training, maternal and child health care and disease prevention, poverty alleviation and microfinance, the Agency has sought to achieve programme results consistent with the targets and commitments established by the United Nations system, such as the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.
UNRWA will continue, in its five areas of operation, to maintain its efforts to achieve this consistency throughout 2006-2007, including in the areas of educational services, health services, relief and social services and income-generating programmes, and will continue to undertake projects to improve infrastructure and socio-economic conditions.
Subprogramme 1 Education
Strategy
21.6 The strategy in attaining the objective includes:
(a) Supporting schools to ensure that each eligible Palestinian child has a place in school, where he/she receives quality education, and improving the services provided in vocational and technical training centres for better job opportunities;

(c) Fostering work relationships with ministries of education in order to have ample time to respond to changes;
(d) Ensuring that equipment, tools and teaching aids are updated;
(e) Ensuring the maintenance of full gender parity in UNRWA schools;
(f) Providing educational services to Palestine refugees in accordance with the needs of the refugees and their identity and cultural heritage and consistent with the standards of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
Subprogramme 2 Health
Strategy
21.7 The strategy in attaining the objective includes:
(a) Focusing on integration of the various elements of care within a primary health-care approach, with special emphasis on reduction of risk factors and management of high-risk groups;
(b) Redesign of the special programme for control of non-communicable diseases and prevention and control of iron-deficiency anaemia in order to improve the impact of these programmes on the health status of the target group;
(c) Continued investment in training and development of health staff;
(d) Strengthened partnerships with stakeholders to help mobilize additional resources, increase efficiency and cost-effectiveness and avoid overlap;
(e) Improving the efficiency of the distribution of food aid.
Subprogramme 3 Relief and social services
Strategy
21.8 The strategy in attaining the objective includes:
(a) Providing food support and other shelter rehabilitation to Palestine refugees to meet their basic needs in order to maintain a reasonable standard of living as well as increase their access to community-based socio-economic opportunities and rehabilitation services to facilitate their self-reliance;
(b) Continued capacity-building efforts, inter alia, through the participation of key staff in training-of-trainers courses that centre on gender issues;
(c) Maintaining up-to-date register of refugees to track eligibility patterns.
Subprogramme 4 Microfinance and microenterprise
Strategy
21.9 The strategy for attaining the objective includes the development of a range of self-sustaining credit products that are sufficiently comprehensive to meet the normal range financial needs of microenterprise owners.
The outreach of these products to the business community will be provided through an expanding network of branch offices in each region to ensure that all areas with significant Palestine refugee populations have access to the programme's loan products.
Each branch office will be developed on the basis of institutional cost recovery; new branch offices will be established only in cases where the market is able to support self-sufficient credit operations.

Programme 22
Humanitarian assistance
Overall orientation
22.1 The overall purpose of the programme is to ensure the timely, coherent and coordinated response of the international community to disasters and emergencies, to promote natural disaster reduction and to facilitate the smooth transition from emergency relief to rehabilitation and development.
The legislative authority and mandate for this programme are derived from General Assembly resolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991, in which the Assembly reaffirmed the guiding principles of humanitarian assistance and reinforced earlier decisions and resolutions adopted by it and the Economic and Social Council concerning humanitarian assistance and the leadership role of the Secretary-General in responding to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies.
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is responsible for the implementation of this programme and the achievement of its objectives.
22.2 The strategy for implementing the programme is based on the need for the development and promotion of a common policy on humanitarian issues for the United Nations system and its partners; the mobilization and coordination of assistance in complex emergencies and disasters; the development and mobilization of United Nations capacity to expedite the provision of international humanitarian assistance; advocacy of humanitarian issues; the promotion of natural disaster reduction; and the availability of timely information on emergencies and natural disasters to facilitate global humanitarian assistance.
The principal responsibility for the implementation of disaster reduction activities resides with the secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and the United Nations Development Programme, while responsibility for the transition from relief to rehabilitation and development also involves organizations participating in the United Nations Development Group.
Subprogramme 1 Policy and analysis
Strategy
22.3 Substantive responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Policy Development and Studies Branch in New York.
22.4 The Branch will continue to develop a humanitarian policy agenda which will identify emerging humanitarian trends and changes in the humanitarian environment in order to build harmonized policy positions among humanitarian agencies based on international humanitarian law, humanitarian principles, including those recognized in General Assembly resolution 46/182, and human rights.
22.5 It will foster strategic and operational coherence, crafting practical policies, guidance and analytic tools for use in the field by humanitarian practitioners.
It will develop aides-memoires and diagnostic tools for political actors, such as Member States and peacekeepers, to use during crisis management to help ensure consideration of key humanitarian concerns.
It will also contribute to the development of training programmes to ensure that staff and other actors in emergencies are aware of key humanitarian policies and methodologies and are able to apply them flexibly and appropriately in varied contexts.
The Branch will help identify best practice and innovative concepts that should be disseminated widely to inform and guide policy, operational decisions and crisis management.
22.6 Moreover, the Branch will support and promote the efforts of Governments of affected countries, upon their request, and those of other agencies, with the approval of the Government concerned, to assist and protect internally displaced persons.
Support will be given to the establishment of effective planning capacity for the management of the transition from relief to reconstruction and development.
In addition, efforts will be made to ensure that lessons learned from past experience are applied to the strengthening of future humanitarian assistance activities.
The secretariat of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee will provide support to the Committee in its efforts to ensure a well-coordinated international response to humanitarian crises and should conduct regular briefings with Member States on its activities.
Subprogramme 2 Coordination of humanitarian action and emergency response
Strategy
22.7 Substantive responsibility for this subprogramme is vested with the Humanitarian Emergency Branch in New York and the Response Coordination Branch in Geneva.
22.8 The Humanitarian Emergency Branch will prepare day-to-day analysis on complex emergencies and natural disasters through its link to resident and humanitarian coordinators and field coordination units of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs worldwide; provide inputs to and monitor all Security Council deliberations on issues with humanitarian implications; represent the Office in relevant United Nations interdepartmental or inter-agency forums dealing with crisis management; provide analysis and recommendations for consideration by the Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs, as well as other United Nations executive committees; enhance preparedness in countries at risk of crisis through support to contingency planning; lead or participate in inter-agency and interdepartmental assessment missions and offer the United Nations system information and advice on a timely basis with respect to humanitarian assistance activities, in strict conformity with the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality, as contained in General Assembly resolution 46/182.
22.9 The Response Coordination Branch will provide support to resident and humanitarian coordinators in the field to ensure effective field-based coordination; aim at the timely mobilization and coordination of international assistance to countries affected by emergencies through strengthened cooperation between assisting and recipient countries; activate international disaster response mechanisms to facilitate international relief assistance; provide support to Member States and international response networks to ensure improved coordination in crisis management; facilitate, where appropriate, field-based strategic planning for the common humanitarian action plans of the United Nations; and draw up appeals to solicit support from the donor community for humanitarian action by the United Nations system and partners.
In addition, it will reinforce services to field offices through greater participation in the inter-agency structure and management of the regional disaster response advisers; strengthen partnerships through the efficient and systematic monitoring of the implementation of policies and programmes; contribute to the analysis of issues related to access security; and analyse emergencies and lessons learned.
Subprogramme 3 Natural disaster reduction
Strategy
22.10 The subprogramme will follow a twofold strategy to achieve its objective concurrent with the focus of activities with the two participating organizations, namely, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
22.11 The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction will continue to pursue promoting links and synergies and the coordination of disaster reduction activities in the socio-economic, humanitarian and development fields, as well as to support policy development and integration in this field.
This will be carried out through increasing public awareness, increasing the application of policy, scientific and technical knowledge for risk and vulnerability reduction in close partnership with various organizations working in this field and, in particular, ensuring the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction into major international sustainable development policy processes and sensitizing the international community and decision-making authorities about the cost-effectiveness of investing in reducing disaster risk and vulnerability.
22.12 Through its network of country offices, UNDP will continue to support the development and implementation of disaster risk reduction programmes and projects at the regional and national levels as an essential objective of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.
This will be carried out through the development of disaster reduction capacity-building strategies and programmes, training for human resource development, mainstreaming risk reduction into ongoing frameworks of cooperation, programmes and projects in country offices and the design and implementation of frameworks and programmes for sustainable recovery.
22.13 A particular relevant result sought from the work of the two organizations is increased investment in disaster risk reduction.
Subprogramme 4 Emergency support services
Strategy
22.14 Substantive responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Emergency Services Branch in Geneva.
22.15 Support will be provided to disaster-affected countries through the strengthening of mechanisms for emergency response; the promotion of the membership of developing and disaster-prone countries in emergency response networks; the development and strengthening of the Office's response capacities; and the improvement of mechanisms, instruments and procedures for the mobilization and coordination of international assistance in case of natural disasters and complex emergencies.
In addition, support will be provided through the increased involvement of potential recipient and donor countries, using a regional approach, as well as United Nations agencies, in relevant activities, including training and exercise programmes and capacity-building for response preparedness.
22.16 Emphasis will be placed on ensuring the timely dissemination of information on the situation in countries affected by emergencies and disasters, including the identification of resource requirements, to humanitarian and other partners; activating emergency and disaster-response tools to reduce their impact; expanding the United Nations Disaster Assessment Coordination team in different regions; standardizing operational procedures for international urban search and rescue teams; further developing a comprehensive network of partners comprising Governments, United Nations agencies, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the Partnership on Environmental Emergencies; and strengthening civil and military coordination through national training programmes to support international humanitarian relief operations.
Subprogramme 5 Humanitarian emergency information and advocacy
Strategy
22.17 Substantive responsibility for this subprogramme rests with the Advocacy, External Relations and Information Management Branch.
22.18 Advocacy being a core mandate of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Branch will enhance partnerships with United Nations departments and agencies, non-governmental organizations, Member States, regional organizations and other stakeholders in order to increase the commitment and support to humanitarian action globally.
The Branch will strengthen public information and media relations capacities at Headquarters and in the field in order to raise awareness of the plight and needs of civilians affected by conflicts and natural disasters and promote adherence to international humanitarian law and principles.
It will also undertake outreach and targeted campaigns, in concert with its partners, to focus attention on specific humanitarian crises and issues.
22.19 Another vital aspect of the subprogramme is to provide timely and reliable information on unfolding emergencies and natural disasters in order to inform decision-making and support humanitarian action on the ground.
The Branch will strengthen the systems for collection, analysis, dissemination and sharing of humanitarian information through expanded networks, coverage and reach.
This includes updating and improving its principal web sites, namely OCHA-Online and ReliefWeb, as well as the Integrated Regional Information Networks, its independent field-based humanitarian news service.
Partnerships with other members of the humanitarian community for information sharing, coordination and standardization will be further enhanced.
22.20 With regard to humanitarian emergencies, the Branch will provide appropriate early information with regard to preventive and preparedness measures.
It will continue to provide secretariat and technical support to the United Nations inter-agency framework for coordination teams and to assist United Nations country teams in the preparation of contingency plans.

Programme 23
Public information
Overall orientation
23.1 The central purpose of the programme is to help fulfil the substantive aims of the United Nations by strategically communicating the activities and concerns of the Organization in order to achieve the greatest public impact.
The responsibility for the programme is vested in the Department of Public Information both at Headquarters in New York and in the worldwide network of United Nations information centres and services, information components and regional hubs, where applicable.
The mandate of the Department is contained in General Assembly resolution 13 (I) of 13 February 1946.
The Department's work is guided by the priorities laid down by the Assembly and its subsidiary body, the Committee on Information, through resolutions on questions relating to information, the most recent of which are 58/101 A and B.
23.2 The strategic framework of the Department seeks to promote global awareness and enhanced understanding of the diverse functions of the United Nations.
To this end and using the United Nations Millennium Declaration as its guide, the Department will focus on priority issues for the Organization, including the eradication of poverty, conflict prevention, sustainable development, human rights, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and the needs of the African continent.
As the Department responsible for the communication policies of the United Nations, the Department of Public Information works closely with substantive offices of the United Nations system to deliver effective and targeted information programmes on the aforementioned key areas.
It strives to reach global audiences, particularly influential opinion leaders, as well as youth, through intermediaries such as the media, governmental and non-governmental organizations, educational institutions, business and professional organizations and other segments of civil society, including through enhanced partnerships.
23.3 Progress will continue to be made towards rationalizing the network of United Nations information centres, in conformity with paragraph 15 of resolution 57/300 of 20 December 2002, resolution 58/101 B of 9 December 2003 and resolution 59/126 B of 10 December 2004, with the objective of enhancing the strategic capacity and value of the centres as a key element in the Department's outreach activities.
23.4 Within this framework, special efforts will be made to ensure that gender mainstreaming is incorporated into the design of public information products and activities, particularly those at the core of the various promotional campaigns for the United Nations system that are spearheaded by the Department.
23.5 Increased use is being made of the latest technology, in both the traditional and electronic media, including the Internet, to deliver news directly and instantaneously to the media worldwide.
Particular attention is given to tailoring the news disseminated to different regions, bearing in mind their technological capacity.
23.6 A major challenge for the Department in implementing this programme is to build bridges effectively in order to make the relevance of the work of the United Nations resonate in the lives and daily concerns of people everywhere.
Subprogramme 1 Strategic communication services
Strategy
23.7 The subprogramme will be implemented by the Strategic Communications Division, which consists of the Communications Campaigns Service, the Information Centres Service, the United Nations information centres and services, information components and regional hubs, where applicable, and the Committee Liaison Unit.
23.8 The objective will be accomplished by giving a more strategic focus to the activities of the Department and the United Nations information centres and services, information components and regional hubs, where applicable.
Priority issues and activities of substantive departments will be identified through a new client planning process and will form the basis of communications plans.
These plans will identify key messages tailored to specific target audiences, which will be reached using the most appropriate tools.
The United Nations Communications Group will be utilized to enhance the coordination of communications activities between the Department and the organizations of the United Nations family relating to these issues.
23.9 In order to generate better-informed public opinion on priority issues, information products for specialized media will be developed and disseminated in the official languages, as well as in local languages where possible, by United Nations information centres and services and regional hubs, where applicable.
Strategic media outreach activities, such as press conferences and interviews with senior officials, will be organized.
Web sites in local languages will continue to be created and maintained by the information centres and regional hubs, where applicable.
23.10 Operational support and strategic communications advice will continue to be provided to the information component of United Nations peace missions, including the maintenance of relevant web sites.
Subprogramme 2 News services
Strategy
23.11 The subprogramme will be implemented primarily by the News and Media Division, supported by the Office of the Spokesman for the Secretary-General and, away from Headquarters, by the United Nations information centres and services, information components and regional hubs, where applicable.
23.12 The objective will be accomplished through the timely delivery of accurate, balanced and, where feasible, customized news and information materials and services, namely, radio, television, photographic, print and Internet, to media and other users globally, utilizing new information technologies to reach a wider audience more quickly.
Multilingualism and developing-country media will be particular priorities of the subprogramme's outreach efforts.
23.13 New information technologies will also enable the subprogramme to focus on improving access from the field, especially during breaking news.
Other benefits from modernization will include enhanced productivity and integration across different media, presenting a coordinated and seamless multimedia service.
23.14 A cohesive promotional and distribution strategy will build more innovative partnerships with major broadcasters.
These collaborations will help meet the needs of a global audience by offering to radio and television networks quality programmes which reflect the priorities identified by Member States, including the Millennium Development Goals.
Special programmes will be produced and distributed as required.
Subprogramme 3 Library services

Programme 24
Management and support services
Overall orientation
24.1 The overall purpose of this programme, the responsibility for which is vested in the Department of Management and the administrative services of the United Nations Office at Geneva, the United Nations Office at Vienna and the United Nations Office at Nairobi, is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Organization in managing its resources in three broad management areas, namely, finance, human resources and support services; to provide support services to the intergovernmental processes of the Organization; to secure financing for the mandated programmes and activities of the Secretariat; and to support the implementation of those programmes and activities.
24.2 The programme derives its mandates from relevant articles of the Charter of the United Nations, specifically Articles 8, 17, 97, 100 and 101, as well as the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Rules, the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation, General Assembly resolutions 41/213 and 42/211 and the successive annual resolutions on the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations, as well as resolutions 52/12 A and B, 57/300 and 58/269 addressing issues of the reform and revitalization of the Organization and other relevant resolutions.
24.3 The programme is oriented principally towards fully meeting client needs and taking a proactive approach to implementing the Secretary-General's management reform measures, including those approved by the General Assembly, with the support of a communication strategy that ensures that Member States, managers and staff are fully informed of and engaged in the efforts to ensure a more effective and results-oriented Organization.
Through a continuous dialogue, the status quo in the functioning of the Organization will be challenged, client priorities identified and management policies developed or improved to ensure that the work of the Organization is carried out in a more timely, efficient and effective manner.
The capacity of managers to deliver mandated programmes will be strengthened through management training and the process of greater delegation of authority, with accountability ensured through systematic monitoring, evaluation and greater transparency in decision-making.
24.4 In pursuing the Secretary-General's management reform measures, results-based budgeting will be further refined to enable programme managers to demonstrate to Member States the impact of their work programmes so that together they may take informed decisions about the priorities of the Organization, the nature and scope of outputs and services and related resource allocations.
Improvements in the financial management of the Organization will continue to be made, particularly with respect to simplification of financial management processes.
Results-based management will be reflected not only in a more effective programme planning and budgeting process, but also in the Organization's management of human resources.
24.5 Human resources management reform will continue to reflect the multicultural environment of the Organization and will be implemented to empower staff, increase their flexibility and mobility in adapting to the priorities of the Organization and enhance their ability to carry out their work more effectively.
The Department will continue to support and strengthen the integration of the gender perspective into the work of the Organization, in fulfilment of its leading role in implementing gender-sensitive policies.
24.6 Safety and security issues have changed dramatically since the formulation of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005.
The apparent immunity of the United Nations to terrorist attacks no longer exists.
The programme will move towards a unified security management structure and strengthened security arrangements for the safety and security of delegations, staff and property at Headquarters and offices away from Headquarters.
The first phases of modernization of the Headquarters buildings will proceed under the auspices of the capital master plan to provide a more secure, safe and efficient working environment for delegations and staff, subject to any decisions that the General Assembly may take on the project.
24.7 Improvements in administrative processes and strategies, streamlining of established procedures and implementation of the information and communication technology strategy will lead to attaining better value for money and achievement of overall goals.
Coherence in management and administration will be promoted with the offices away from Headquarters, regional commissions and peacekeeping and other missions, which will be given greater authority to respond to the requirements of their offices.
24.8 The Department's leadership role within the United Nations common system will be maintained and synergies will be achieved through partnering with other organizations of the United Nations common system.
Within the context of the Secretary-General's management reform, efforts will continue towards further strengthening of the existing common and joint services and the expansion and development of new common and joint services among the United Nations organizations when such services appear to be more efficient and cost-effective than the decentralized arrangements.
24.9 The Department will provide strategic policy guidance to all entities of the Secretariat in the above-mentioned broad management areas.
It will provide substantive and/or technical secretariat support to the Administrative and Budgetary (Fifth) Committee, the Committee for Programme and Coordination, the Committee on Contributions, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Board of Auditors.

Programme 25
Internal oversight
Overall orientation
25.1 The overall purpose of the programme is to enhance effectiveness in the implementation of all programmes through continually improved internal control mechanisms within the Organization.
The mandate for the programme derives from the responsibility of the Secretary-General as the chief administrative officer of the United Nations, entrusted to him under Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations.
The Office of Internal Oversight Services exercises operational independence under the authority of the Secretary-General in the conduct of its duties, in accordance with Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations.
The Office has the authority to initiate, carry out, and report on any action which it considers necessary to fulfil its responsibilities with regard to its oversight functions.
25.2 The mandate for the programme is derived from General Assembly resolutions 48/218 B and 54/244, the relevant provisions of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2003/7) and of the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2000/8).
25.3 The Office assists Member States and the Organization in protecting its assets and in ensuring the compliance of programme activities with resolutions, regulations, rules and policies as well as the more efficient and effective delivery of the Organization's activities; preventing and detecting fraud, waste, abuse, malfeasance or mismanagement; and improving the delivery of the Organization's programmes and activities to enable it to achieve better results by determining all factors affecting the efficient and effective implementation of programmes.
25.4 The strategy of the Office is focused on ensuring that the Organization has an effective and transparent system of accountability in place and on developing the capacity of the Organization to identify, assess and mitigate the risks and threats that might prevent it from achieving its objectives.
To that end, the Office will: (a) propose measures to assist the Organization to respond rapidly to emerging risks and opportunities; (b) provide independent information and assessments to assist effective decision-making; (c) provide independent reviews on the effective use of the Organization's resources; and (d) promote a culture of change, including accountability, planning, integrity, results orientation and risk awareness and management.
25.5 The Office undertakes a number of activities to support the Organization's commitment to gender mainstreaming, including oversight of United Nations gender mainstreaming efforts.
In addition, the Office assists the Organization in achieving better results by determining the factors affecting the efficient and effective implementation of programmes in accordance with, inter alia, the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992.
The Office is also working to enhance coordination with the United Nations Board of Auditors and the Joint Inspection Unit.
Subprogramme 1 Internal audit
Strategy
25.6 Based on the standards for the professional practice of internal auditing, the Internal Audit Division will perform independent audits and make recommendations to mitigate risks, increase efficiency and effectiveness, and improve compliance with legislative mandates, regulations and rules by programme managers.
The Internal Audit Division will provide the Secretary-General and the legislative bodies with timely reports and recommendations to facilitate their decision-making, to improve United Nations programmes and field operations, and actively monitor, follow up and report on the implementation of audit recommendations.
Subprogramme 2 Monitoring, evaluation and consulting
Strategy
25.7 The Monitoring, Evaluation and Consulting Division will advance results-based management by assisting programme managers in the application of the relevant methodologies and tools.
The Division will promote efficiencies by providing timely assessments and advice on programme design and implementation to programme managers.
It will offer consulting, learning and self-evaluation services using a collaborative, results-driven and client-oriented approach.
It will continue to report to the intergovernmental bodies on the relevance, usefulness, efficiency and effectiveness of the Organization, in order to facilitate their decision-making.
Subprogramme 3 Investigations
Strategy
25.8 The Investigations Division will undertake professional investigations of reported allegations of fraud, misconduct, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, violations of regulations and rules of the United Nations and other malfeasance in accordance with mandated requirements.
Every matter that is received by the Division is assessed in order to identify the level of risk each of those matters presents to the Organization.
Those which are deemed as “significant” or higher-risk are given priority, but lower risks still warrant inquiry as resources are available.
On the basis of its findings, the Division will recommend the administrative, disciplinary, jurisdictional or other corrective action that should be taken.
The Division has also sought to provide managers with the ability to identify risks, including undertaking basic investigative training for departments and offices so that they may be better equipped to address lower-risk matters that the Division would not be able to address.
In addition, without compromising the operational independence granted under General Assembly resolutions 48/218 B and 54/244, the Division will provide investigative services to the United Nations Funds and Programmes, as appropriate.
Legislative mandates
General Assembly resolutions
Programme 26
Jointly financed activities
International Civil Service Commission
Overall orientation
26.1 By its resolution 3357 (XXIX) of 18 December 1974, the General Assembly established the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) for the regulation and coordination of the conditions of service of the United Nations common system.
Under its statute, the Commission is a subsidiary organ of the Assembly.
It performs its functions in respect of the United Nations and of those specialized agencies and other international organizations that participate in the United Nations common system.
In the exercise of its functions, the Commission is guided by the principle set out in the agreements between the United Nations and the other organizations, aiming at the development of a single unified international civil service through the application of common personnel standards, methods and arrangements.
The Commission is further mandated through Assembly resolutions 51/216 and 52/216 to play a lead role in the development of innovative approaches in the field of human resources management as part of the overall reform currently taking place in the organizations of the common system.
Strategy
26.2 To accomplish its objectives, the Commission's programme of work includes the following areas: (a) to develop further and to strengthen a common system of salaries, allowances and benefits under the Noblemaire and Flemming principles; (b) to equalize the purchasing power of salaries worldwide through post adjustment classifications; (c) to develop and maintain equitable job evaluation and other human resources management systems; (d) to provide guidance and advice on their administration; and (e) to provide substantive support to Member States and common system organizations (including staff) in the reform and maintenance of a coherent and effective human resources management system more closely aligned with the achievement of organizational goals and objectives.
Joint Inspection Unit
Overall orientation
26.3 According to the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit, the Inspectors have the broadest powers of investigation in all matters bearing on the efficiency of services and the proper use of funds, and provide an independent view through inspection and evaluation aimed at improving management and methods and at achieving greater coordination between organizations.
The Unit is to satisfy itself that the activities undertaken by the organizations are carried out in the most economical manner and that the optimum use is made of resources available for carrying out these activities.
26.4 In line with the directives of the legislative organs of its participating organizations, the Unit takes full advantage of its system-wide competence, which puts it in the unique position of acting as a catalyst for the comparison and dissemination of best managerial, administrative and programming practices in the system as a whole.
Based on comparative analyses of trends and problems faced by various organizations, it proposes harmonized and concrete solutions.
The Unit focuses its work on important priority items for the participating organizations, with a view to providing the legislative organs of those organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations on precisely defined issues.
Strategy
26.5 In achieving its objectives the Unit will concentrate on: (a) identifying the key issues and risk areas of the organizations and undertaking research and analysis of those issues; (b) giving greater attention to issues of major importance to legislative organs and the executive heads of the participating organizations and to the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination; (c) producing action-oriented reports and recommendations; (d) monitoring the implementation of approved/accepted recommendations and reporting thereon; and (e) strengthening its capacity to provide, in accordance with article 5.3 of the statute, reasonable independent assurances to the legislative organs that the activities undertaken by the organizations are conducted in the most effective and economical manner.
The Unit will continue streamlining and improving its working methods with a view to increasing its efficiency and the effectiveness of its recommendations.
C. United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination
Overall orientation
26.6 The responsibility for the promotion of inter-agency coordination and cooperation within the organizations of the United Nations system is vested in the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), which, pursuant to Economic and Social Council decision 2001/321 of 24 October 2001, replaced the Administrative Committee on Coordination, established in 1946 by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 13 (III).
Two high-level committees assist the executive heads in performing their functions: the High-level Committee on Programmes, whose central role is the development of concerted and effective responses by the United Nations system to emerging policy challenges and issues relating to international cooperation and development; and the High-level Committee on Management, whose mandate is to provide guidance on administrative and management issues that are of system-wide relevance and promote inter-agency cooperation and coordination on those matters.
26.7 During the biennium 2006-2007, the main focus of CEB in programme matters will be on coordinated system-wide implementation of the outcomes of the first comprehensive review of the follow-up to the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the associated high-level event in 2005 provided for in General Assembly resolution 57/270 B.
It will thus focus its work on accelerating progress in the implementation of internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992, and the continued strengthening of system-wide support for the sustainable development of Africa within the overall framework of the New Partnership for Africa's Development.
On the management side, CEB will continue its emphasis on implementation of inter-agency agreements on the security and safety of United Nations system personnel and human resources management, capitalizing on investments in information and communication technologies and promoting best practices in the management and financial administration areas.
Those activities are all geared towards ensuring a more integrated and coordinated United Nations system response to the policy directives and mandates of Member States.
Strategy
26.8 During the biennium 2006-2007, both the High-level Committee on Programmes and the High-level Committee on Management will continue to engage the organizations of the United Nations system on a system-wide framework to pursue strategic actions pertaining to programme matters and management and administrative issues for the consideration of CEB.
The High-level Committee on Programmes will focus on promoting greater synergies among the policies and programmes of the organizations of the United Nations system so as to enhance their overall impact and on ensuring mutual reinforcement between global and country monitoring activities of the Millennium Development Goals.
As necessary, the Committee will draw on inter-agency networks and working groups to undertake specific and time-bound activities.
In the management area, the High-level Committee on Management will keep on its agenda the strengthening of inter-agency cooperation to reinforce measures for the security and safety of United Nations personnel and focus on promoting best practices, modern management approaches and partnerships in all areas of management, finance and budget.
In the areas of information and communication technologies, the Committee will continue to promote greater accessibility to United Nations system information of Member States and the general public, including the further development of the United Nations system Extranet and tools for knowledge-sharing and management.
D. Inter-organizational security measures
Overall orientation
26.9 The primary responsibility under the Charter for the security and protection of personnel of the United Nations system lies with the Member States.
However, there are situations under which Governments do not provide security coverage, particularly during emergency situations, such as abrupt changes in Government, civil disorder and the absence of de facto authorities.
In order to enhance the security and safety of personnel of the organizations of the United Nations system in such situations and to prepare for any eventuality, a set of arrangements have been in place since 1980 to ensure coordinated action in all matters relating to the security and safety of field-based staff and their families.
Under those arrangements, the responsibility for the coordination of all security matters rests with the Secretary-General, who has appointed the United Nations Security Coordinator to act on his behalf.
The Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator was created in 1988 and has the responsibility to coordinate and manage the United Nations security management system.
Concerned about the occurrence of attacks and threats against United Nations personnel, the General Assembly, in its resolution 54/192 of 17 December 1999, recognized the need to improve the safety and security arrangements for United Nations personnel and to strengthen the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator.
The Security Coordinator acts on behalf of and reports directly to the Secretary-General.
26.10 The United Nations Security Coordinator coordinates and monitors the planning and implementation of inter-agency security and safety programmes, including all training.
The Security Coordinator acts as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation concerning security matters and reviews security plans formulated by designated officials in each country to ensure that each duty station is adequately prepared for likely contingencies.
The Coordinator will, inter alia, maintain on a continuing basis an assessment of exposures and vulnerabilities to actual or potential emergency situations, prepare information and instructions and arrange for pre-assignment briefings so as to assist designated officials, review all requests for security and communication equipment and issue monthly travel advisories.
A mechanism of accountability and responsibility of security officials at all levels of the security management system is in place to ensure that the officials responsible for the security of the United Nations operations and personnel in the field are held accountable for both their action and inaction.
Strategy
26.11 In achieving its objective, the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator will concentrate on creating conditions to minimize security-related incidents by: (a) coordinating safety and security issues between the organizations of the United Nations system; (b) monitoring the implementation of established security and safety policies; (c) developing security requirements for new missions as well as for special, regular and emergency operations; (d) monitoring, through compliance, assessment, survey and inspection missions, the implementation of the minimum operating security standards at field duty stations; (e) updating guidelines and directives and conducting training; and (f) coordinating with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Political Affairs and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on the planning, implementation and review of safety and security programmes for peacekeeping, humanitarian and other special missions in the field.
Those efforts will enforce the accountability and responsibility of designated officials, field security officers and other actors within the framework of the new mechanism of accountability and responsibility in the area of field security for the implementation of the minimum operating security standards at all duty stations of the United Nations system.
