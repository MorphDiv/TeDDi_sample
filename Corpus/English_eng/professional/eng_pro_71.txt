SIXTH MEETING OF THE 10 17 June
ON THE PROHIBITION OF THE USE,
STOCKPILING, PRODUCTION AND
Sixth Meeting
Zagreb, 28 November - 2 December
Item 4 11 (e) (iv) of the revised provisional agenda
Consideration of the general status and
operation of the Convention
Other matters essential for achieving the Convention's aims
Implementation Support
THE IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT UNIT,
Prepared by the Director of the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining
Background
At their Third Meeting (3MSP), taking place in Managua in September 2001, the States Parties endorsed the President's Paper on the Establishment of the Implementation Support Unit (ISU) and mandated the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) to establish this Unit.
The 3MSP also encouraged States Parties in a position to do so to make voluntary contributions in support of the ISU.
In addition, the States Parties mandated the President of the 3MSP, in consultation with the Coordination Committee, to finalise an agreement between the States Parties and the GICHD on the functioning of the ISU.
The Council of Foundation of the GICHD accepted this mandate on 28 September 2001.
In accordance with the above-mentioned actions taken by the States Parties at the 3MSP, an agreement on the functioning of the ISU was finalised between the States Parties and the GICHD on 7 November 2001.
This agreement indicates i.a. that the Director of the GICHD shall submit a written report on the functioning of the ISU to the States Parties and that this report shall cover the period between two Meetings of the States Parties.
As the First Review Conference was a formal meeting of the States Parties, this report has been prepared to cover the period between the First Review Conference and the Sixth Meeting of the States Parties.
Activities
The adoption by the States Parties of the Nairobi Action Plan gave the ISU clear and comprehensive direction for the post-Review Conference period.
Since the First Review Conference, the ISU supported the President, Co-Chairs, Contact Group Coordinators and individual States Parties in their pursuit of the aims of the Nairobi Action Plan.
In particular, the ISU supported the Coordinating Committee in ensuring the success of the June 2005 meetings of the Standing Committees, in part by preparing, on behalf of the Coordinating Committee, a comprehensive package of background materials for these meetings.
Certain Co-Chairs and Contact Group Coordinators launched particularly ambitious initiatives and the ISU responded accordingly.
For example, the Co-Chairs of the Standing Committee on Victim Assistance sought to assist the 24 most relevant States Parties in establishing concrete victim assistance objectives for the 2005-09 period.
This involved the ISU developing a comprehensive information gathering tool for these States Parties to use and saw the ISU provide substantive and organizational support to two regional conferences.
At the request of the Coordinator of the Resource Mobilization Contact Group, the ISU conducted research on the flow of mine action resources.
In addition, for the Coordinator of the Universalisation Contact Group Coordinator, the ISU has prepared a compilation of key documents from the First Review Conference.
The ISU provided its traditional substantive and organizational support to the President-Designate of the Sixth Meeting of the States Parties (6MSP), working closely with the UN Department for Disarmament Affairs (UNDDA).
Providing advice and information to individual States Parties on implementation matters continued to be a central feature of the work of the ISU.
The ISU responded to an average of 20 to 40 such requests each month in addition to requests for information from States not parties, the media, and interested organizations and individuals.
The GICHD continued to administer the Sponsorship Programme established by some States Parties to the Convention.
This Programme aims to support widespread participation in meetings related to the Convention.
During the June 2005 Standing Committee meetings, the GICHD administered sponsorship to 45 delegates.
In accordance with the mandate to provide assistance in administrating the Sponsorship Programme, the ISU provided advice to the Programme's donors' group and information to sponsored delegates on how to maximise their participation in the Intersessional Work Programme.
This assistance contributed to an increase in the number and quality of presentations made by States Parties which are in the process of fulfilling obligations.
The ISU continued to collect a large number of pertinent documents for the Convention's Documentation Centre, which is maintained by the ISU as part of its mandate.
The Documentation Centre currently contains over 5,000 records and continues to be used by States Parties and other interested actors as an important source of information on the Convention.
In addition, in 2005 the ISU expanded the content on the GICHD's web site concerning the Convention and its implementation.
Financial Arrangements
In 2005, the permanent staffing of the ISU remained unchanged: a full-time ISU Manager, a full-time Implementation Support Officer, and a half-time Administrative Assistant.
As indicated in the President's Paper on the Establishment of the Implementation Support Unit (ISU) and the agreement between the States Parties and the GICHD, the GICHD created a Voluntary Trust Fund for activities of the ISU in late 2001.
The purpose of this fund is to finance the on-going activities of the ISU, with the States Parties endeavouring to assure the necessary financial resources.
Contributions to the ISU Voluntary Trust Fund
1 January 2004 to 31 October
In accordance with the agreement between the States Parties and the GICHD, prior to the First Review Conference the Coordinating Committee was consulted on the 2005 ISU budget.
As of 7 November 2005 preparations were underway to consult the Coordinating Committee on a 2006 ISU budget covering the period from 1 January to 31 December 2006.
The 2005 ISU budget, which had been distributed to all States Parties by the President of the Fifth Meeting of the States Parties prior to the First Review Conference, was again distributed to the States Parties in 2005 by the President of the First Review Conference.
In accordance with the agreement between the States Parties and the GICHD, the Voluntary Trust Fund's 2004 financial statement was independently audited (by PriceWaterhouseCoopers).
The audit indicated that the financial statement of the Voluntary Trust Fund had been properly prepared in accordance with relevant accounting policies and the applicable Swiss legislation.
The audited financial statement, which indicated that the 2004 expenditures of the ISU totalled CHF 576,074, was forwarded to the Presidency, the Coordinating Committee and donors in summer 2005.
