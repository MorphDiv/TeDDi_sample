Sixtieth session
Item 114 of the provisional agenda*
Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments
Appointment of members of the Committee on Conferences
Note by the Secretary-General
By its resolution 43/222 B of 21 December 1988, the General Assembly decided that the Committee on Conferences should be composed of 21 members to be appointed by the President of the Assembly, after consultations with the chairmen of the regional groups, for a period of three years, on the basis of the following geographical distribution:
(a) Six members from African States;
(b) Five members from Asian States;
(c) Four members from Latin American and Caribbean States;
(d) Two members from Eastern European States;
(e) Four members from Western European and other States.
The Assembly further decided that one third of the Committee's membership should retire annually and that retiring members would be eligible for reappointment.
The present membership of the Committee on Conferences is as follows:
* Term of office expires on 31 December 2005.
** Term of office expires on 31 December 2006.
*** Term of office expires on 31 December 2007.
Since the terms of office of Bolivia, the Congo, France, India, Japan, the Russian Federation and Zambia will expire on 31 December 2005, it will be necessary for the President of the General Assembly at the sixtieth session to appoint seven members to fill the resulting vacancies.
The members so appointed will serve for a period of three years, beginning on 1 January 2006.
