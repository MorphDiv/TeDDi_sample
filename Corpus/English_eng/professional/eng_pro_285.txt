Regional Ministerial Conference of French-speaking Countries of Africa for the ratification and implementation of the United Nations Conventions on combating terrorism, corruption and transnational organized crime and universal counter-terrorism instruments
Port Louis, Mauritius, 25-27 October 2004
Report
Introduction
The Regional Ministerial Conference of French-speaking African Countries for the ratification and implementation of the United Nations Conventions against corruption, transnational organized crime and the universal anti-terrorism instruments was held at Port Louis, Mauritius from 25 to 27 October 2004.
This meeting was jointly sponsored by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Agence intergouvernementale de la Francophonie (AIF) with the cooperation of the Government of Mauritius.
It is a direct result of the Cairo Declaration, adopted on 4 September 2003 at the conclusion of the Regional Ministerial Conference of the French-speaking Countries of Africa to promote the ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTO) and its additional protocols.
This Declaration requested the AIF and UNODC to set up a support and follow-up mechanism for their implementation by States, by implementation, to their benefit, of exchanges of expertise and technical assistance of the most varied kind and adapted to their needs.
Organization of the Conference
Opening of the Conference
The Conference was opened by His Excellency Mr. Pravind Jugnauth, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economic Development of Mauritius, followed by four statements.
In his opening address, Mr. Jean-Paul Laborde, representative of UNODC, underlined the capital importance of the Mauritius meeting, which offered Ministers of Justice an opportunity to receive an update on progress made and difficulties encountered since the Cairo Conference, to evaluate the legislative changes necessary and to explore the new fields of operation opened by the adoption of the United Nations Convention against Corruption.
He also thanked the Government of Mauritius for the warm welcome and fine organization of the Conference.
Next, Mr. Pasteur Nzinahora, representative of AIF, expressed the thanks of his organization to the host country, before recalling the main purpose of the meeting, which demonstrated the continuing interest of Ministers of Justice in the development of cooperation and mutual exchange.
He stressed the degree to which the strengthening of the rule of law was affected by the combating of international criminal activity in all its forms.
Mr. Emmanuel Jean Leung Shing, Minister of Justice and Human Rights of Mauritius, then took the floor to welcome his counterparts and all the participants, and to reveal that the choice of Mauritius to host the Conference had been neither accidental nor fortuitous, given his country's repeatedly demonstrated commitment to contribute to the global fight against impunity for the crimes that offended the universal conscience.
To combat the scourges of terrorism, transnational organized crime and corruption effectively, he stressed the imperative need for the countries of Africa to unite and work together.
Mr. Pravind Jugnauth, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economic Development, thanked UNODC and AIF for choosing Mauritius to host this important event and stressed the need for a combined offensive by States to counter the global crime industry.
He detailed the efforts undertaken by Mauritius to combat the crimes that were the subject of the Conference and promised the participants the unwavering support of his country's Government for the success of the objectives of the meeting.
He then declared the Conference open.
Participation
The Ministers and delegations representing the following French-speaking States of Africa participated in the Conference: Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Morocco, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tomé and Principe, Senegal, Togo and Tunisia.
The following organizations and institutes also participated in the Conference as observers: the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the African Union and the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders.
The detailed list of participants is contained in annex III.
C. Election of the Bureau and adoption of the agenda
After the opening of the Conference, the representative of Egypt proposed that the Minister of Justice and Human Rights of Mauritius, the host country, should be elected President of the Conference by acclamation.
This proposal was immediately accepted by all delegations.
After his election, the President proposed that the representatives of Senegal and Egypt should be elected Vice-Presidents and nominated Cameroon and Guinea as co-rapporteurs.
The Conference endorsed these proposed nominations by acclamation.
The Bureau of the Conference was composed of the following:
President: His Excellency Mr. Emmanuel Jean Leung Shing, Minister of Justice and Human Rights of Mauritius
Vice-Presidents: His Excellency Mr. Serigne Diop, Minister of Justice of Senegal
His Excellency Mr. Iskandar Ghattas, Secretary of State for Justice of Egypt
Rapporteurs: Mr. Michel Mahouvé, representative of Cameroon
Mr. Sekou Keita, representative of Guinea
The participants subsequently adopted the agenda and organization of work attached in annex I.
Proceedings of the Conference
Technical presentations were made on the various items of the agenda, following which the participants exchanged views on their experience and expectations.
Implementation of the Cairo Declaration: follow-up and support to the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto and the universal anti-terrorism instruments
The representatives of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime made a detailed presentation on the progress made by the French-speaking States of Africa in the ratification of the Convention and its three protocols concerning trafficking in persons, illicit trafficking in migrants and manufacture of and illicit trafficking in firearms, as well as in the ratification of the universal anti-terrorism instruments.
The participants welcomed the quality of the reports produced, which had highlighted the very positive elements directly related to the commitments made in the Cairo Declaration.
In particular, it was noted that, since the Cairo Ministerial Conference, the number of ratifications or adherences to the instruments in question had markedly increased.
The representatives of the Office made available to participants Legislative Guides for the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the protocols thereto, which would support States in their efforts to ratify and implement those instruments.
Each participating delegation then presented national reports on that agenda item.
It was noted that since the Cairo Conference:
- a noticeable effort had been made by most States present to sign and ratify the universal instruments against organized crime, terrorism and corruption or to accede to them;
- although some States had completed the internal procedures for ratification or accession, they had not yet deposited the instruments with the depositary indicated in each of those international treaties;
- the implementation of the instruments ratified was more or less in effect or in progress;
- the delay experienced by certain other States in signing, ratifying or acceding to these instruments was essentially due to political, institutional or economic crises they had undergone or were undergoing, a situation which nevertheless did not affect their desire to become parties.
After these reports, the League of Arab States, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the African Union and the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders underlined the importance of this Conference, and affirmed that they were fully prepared to take up these initiatives and participate in their actions in this field.
Presentation of the Legislative Guide to the Universal Anti-Terrorism Conventions and Protocols
At the request of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the United Nations Security Council, a Guide for the incorporation into legislation and the implementation of the anti-terrorism instruments had been developed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for use by French-speaking States and presented at the Port Louis Ministerial Conference in implementation of the Cairo Declaration.
The purpose of this Guide is to assist States in the ratification, incorporation into domestic law and implementation of anti-terrorism instruments.
This working tool was particularly welcomed by the participants, who recommended its broadest possible dissemination.
C. United Nations Convention against Corruption: overview, prospects and promotion of its entry into force and future work with a view to its effective application
The representatives of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime presented the objectives, structure and essential elements of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, as well as the signatures and ratifications of the instrument.
It was pointed out that the ten ratifications registered to date out of the thirty necessary for its entry into force included two French-speaking African States.
African Union Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Corruption
An expert from the Agence intergouvernementale de la Francophonie presented a comparative study of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Corruption, noting their complementarity.
He did, however, underline the low number of ratifications: four out of the fifteen necessary for its entry into force.
While noting the usefulness of this regional instrument, the participants mentioned the risk of potential jurisdictional conflicts in the event of the proliferation of legal instruments on the same subject.
E. Necessary measures for the implementation of those instruments
Noting the technical difficulties related to the deposit of the instruments of ratification of the conventions and protocols, it was considered useful to specify the modalities.
The delegates unanimously expressed the need for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Agence intergouvernementale de la Francophonie to continue to provide and further develop technical assistance appropriate to States.
On the subject of combating corruption, a particular effort for the ratification of the United Nations Convention among French-speaking African States was urged, so that they would have adequate representation at the Conference of States Parties once that instrument entered into force, and could thus take an active part in its monitoring mechanism.
The same ratification efforts should be undertaken with regard to the African Union Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Corruption.
Furthermore, the participants considered that it was important expressly to designate a focal point within each Ministry of Justice with responsibility for follow-up on those matters.
Considering the results obtained since the Cairo Declaration and the proven usefulness of its monitoring mechanism, the delegates wished to see the Ministerial Conference held annually.
Finally, the participants also requested that the Port Louis Declaration should be brought to the attention of the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, to be held in Bangkok from 18 to 25 April 2005.
Port Louis Declaration
At the conclusion of their work, the Ministers and Heads of delegations adopted the Port Louis Declaration, contained in annex II.
Closure of the session
His Excellency Mr. Emmanuel Jean Leung Shing, Minister of Justice and Human Rights of Mauritius, presided over the closing ceremony.
The representatives of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Agence intergouvernementale de la Francophonie, after thanking the participants for the high quality of their work and the Government of the Republic of Mauritius for the excellent organization of the Conference, undertook to continue and expand their actions in support of States.
His Excellency Mr. Emmanuel Jean Leung Shing drew attention to the dangers of cybercrime, invited participants to pay close attention to that worrisome phenomenon, and stressed the importance of beginning work on a new United Nations instrument without delay.
He expressed particular thanks to His Excellency Mr. Serigne Diop, Minister of Justice of Senegal, for his invitation to host the next Regional Ministerial Conference of the French-speaking African Countries in Dakar in 2005.
Finally, on behalf of all the delegations, the representative of Egypt expressed his warmest thanks to the Republic of Mauritius.
His Excellency Mr. Emmanuel Jean Leung Shing, after thanking UNODC and AIF for the excellent manner in which they had organized its work, declared the Port Louis Conference closed.
