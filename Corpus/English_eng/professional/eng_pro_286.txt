"COOPERATING FOR DEMOCRACY"
30 April 2005
We, the Participants in the Third Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies held in Santiago on April 28-30, 2005 approve:
Reaffirming the vital importance of the observance of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, the International Bill of Human Rights, as well as the fundamental principles of international law.
Recommitting to act in accordance with universally recognized standards of human rights with the purpose of strengthening dialogue and cooperation between states, peoples and individuals.
Reaffirming further our commitment to the "Warsaw Declaration: Toward a Community of Democracies", approved at the First Ministerial Conference on June 27, 2000 in Warsaw, and to the implementation of the "Seoul Plan of Action: Investing for Peace and Prosperity," and the “Community of Democracies Statement on Terrorism,” adopted at the Second Ministerial Conference, held in Seoul on November 16, 2002, declare that:
We renew our conviction that democracy, sustainable development, peace, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing.
Democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social, and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives.
We reaffirm that education in human rights and democracy is essential for participation in the democratic process and governance.
We recognize, in line with the Seoul Plan of Action, that respect for human rights - civil, political, economic, social and cultural - including freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of religion and conscience; access to and free exercise of power in accordance with the rule of law; the holding of periodic free and fair elections based on secret balloting and universal sufferage monitored by independent election authorities; freedom of association, including the right to form independent political parties; separation of powers, especially an independent judiciary; and constitutional subordination of all state institutions, including the military, to the legally-constituted civilian authority, are essential elements of democracy.
We are also convinced that democracy cannot be sustained without strict adherence to the principle of non-discrimination, including protection for persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and indigenous peoples, and persistent efforts to eliminate extreme poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, economic disparities, and social exclusion.
We reaffirm our commitment to uphold the values of tolerance and compromise that underpin effective democratic systems and to promote respect for pluralism, so as to enable societies to retain their multicultural characters.
We firmly reject ethnic and religious hatred, violence, and other forms of extremism.
We take note of the significant expansion in the number of democracies over the last half century and welcome the progress made thus far towards achieving goals and objectives contained in the Warsaw Declaration and the Seoul Plan of Action.
We believe that increasing the number of democratic nations and supporting the development and strengthening of emerging democracies helps to build a safer world in which individuals, women and men equally, can live freely and in an environment of peace, stability, and well-being characterized by respect for the rule of law.
To that end, we reiterate our commitment to supporting processes of transition to democracy, to the strengthening of institutions and democratic processes, at the national, regional and international levels, and to working in partnership with those promoting democracy, including civil society.
The democratization of the multilateral system, particularly the United Nations (UN), is the necessary counterpart to democratic practice within nations.
Every nation that practices democracy must strive to ensure that in international affairs decision-making is equally open, transparent legitimate and equitably representative.
In the Millennium Declaration, all members States of the UN have pledged to strengthen their capacity to implement the principles and practices of democracy.
In this context, we emphasize that the UN plays a central role in achieving such objectives and we pledge to support the further expansion and strengthening of its activities to broaden and reinforce democratic trends throughout the world.
Given that democratic governance is a key element for development, security and human rights, our governments will actively engage in the discussion of UN reform initiated by the Secretary-General's recent report “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all.”
Truthful to the guiding tenets expressed in the Warsaw Declaration and with the aim of continuing implementing the Seoul Plan of Action, we therefore adopt this Commitment, which represents the agenda for the activities of the Community of Democracies based upon reflections on the situation of democracy worldwide at the dawn of the 21st Century, reiterating our firm will to promote and strengthen democracy domestically, regionally and globally, in particular through appropriate international organizations and institutions.
Democratic Governance and Civil Society.
We are committed to enhancing the participation of a dynamic civil society at the domestic and international level, and we encourage non-governmental organizations who are actively promoting activities to strengthen and support democracies and respect for human rights worldwide.
To that end we will,
Promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms to foster the empowerment of a vital civil society and the elimination of all forms of discrimination and intolerance.
Encourage a culture of tolerance, actively promoting dialogue and mutual respect, by developing educational and other programs aimed at the prevention of violations of human rights, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Cooperate and build partnerships with civil society in pursuit of the rule of law, human rights, democratic governance and institution building.
Promote regular dialogue between governmental and civil society actors, to exchange ideas on strengthening domestic democratic development, effectively fighting corruption, promoting and protecting human rights, upholding the government's integrity and good governance, fighting poverty, promoting transparency and access to information via free media, promoting development and dialogue at the international level to support democracy in regional and international fora.
Promote an environment for the strengthening, democratization, innovation and modernization of political parties and other political organizations, in order to achieve a democracy in which citizens are full participants.
Special attention will be paid to the implementation of free and fair elections, including the transparent and impartial administration of elections, and establishing a transparent system for their financing.
Encourage the full participation of women on the basis of equality in all spheres of society, including participation in the decision-making process and access to power, as a fundamental element in the promotion and exercise of a democratic culture.
Affirm that democracy demands an active participation of young people.
We express our commitment to promote among youth a set of democratic values and we urge all countries to implement strategies, policies, programs and concrete measures designed to foster education for democracy and encourage the contribution of youth in all areas of society.
Acknowledge that the promotion and strengthening of democratic governance is a shared responsibility of all public authorities, civil society and political parties.
Welcome the work of the Non-Governmental Process of the Community of Democracies as a significant contribution to the government and civil society dialogue and we encourage its participants to support the implementation of this Ministerial Commitment and participate in future Ministerial Meetings of the Community of Democracies as appropriate.
Poverty, Development and Democratic Governance.
We recognize the importance our citizens place on the improvement of living conditions.
We also recognize the mutually reinforcing benefits that democratic process offers to achieve sustained economic growth and poverty eradication.
We recognize the importance of the progressive realization, in all countries, of the economic, social, and cultural rights as constituting a solid basis for the economic and political empowerment, including the progressive improvement of the quality of life of all individuals.
We reaffirm the principles outlined in the Monterrey Consensus: good governance at both national and international levels is essential for sustainable development.
Sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people, and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth, poverty eradication, and employment creation.
Freedom, peace and security, domestic stability, respect for human rights, including the right to development, and the rule of law, gender equality, market oriented policies, and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies are also essential and mutually reinforcing.
In this sense, we identify as a main mission of the Community of Democracies the strengthening of democratic governance as an essential component of our efforts to alleviate poverty and support economic growth and sustainable human development and our common pursuit of growth, poverty eradication, inequality reduction and sustainable development, and achieving the internationally-agreed goals, including those contained in the Millennium Summit Declaration.
To that end we will
While emphasizing the primary responsibility that each country has for its own economic and social development, and the role of national policies and development strategies, underline the importance of a democratic, transparent, and enabling international economic environment.
Seek to assist each other in economic and social development, including eradication of poverty, as an essential contributing factor to the promotion and preservation of democratic development.
Work with international and regional development organizations and one another to improve the design and implementation of poverty reduction strategies which support democratic institution building.
Countries that promote the rule of law, including respect for human rights and good governance, seek to eliminate corruption and invest in their people are in a position to better utilize development assistance and promote aid effectiveness.
Support concrete actions at the national, regional and international level on Financing for Development, in fulfillment of the commitments of the Monterrey Consensus and recall the commitments made to increase the level and effectiveness of official development assistance and encourage further progress towards the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product.
Encourage efforts to enhance political support to chart a practical path for development financing and the promotion of development.
We note with great interest the "Initiative Against Hunger and Poverty" and other related initiatives, as innovative programs to bridge the gap between political undertaking and development financing.
Foster the creation of jobs to confront poverty and strengthen democratic governance and promote the exercise of workers' rights in the frame of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the protection of the rights of workers overseas.
Encourage men and women to develop their full potential to create an educated public who can participate in the national decision-making process by strengthening education, health services and other basic needs, by promoting the progressive realization of the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and strengthening other basic needs.
Jointly work for a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round, which is vital to economic development, empowerment and reduction in poverty.
Seek cooperation schemes which tend to achieve not only respect for civil and political rights, but also economic, social and cultural rights, so as to attain societies wherein all persons are able to fully exercise their rights.
Support the elaboration of an expanded and comprehensive response to the HIV-AIDS pandemic, which places an enormous drag on economic growth, weakens governance and security structures, and cooperate on seeking adequate resources to reverse the spread of HIV-AIDS.
Regional and Interregional Cooperation for Democratic Governance.
Guided by the tenet of due respect for sovereignty and the principle of non-interference in internal affairs as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations and the Warsaw Declaration, we intend to continue promoting inter- and cross-regional democratic progress and cooperation, and to that end we will,
Continue to contribute with technical expertise and cooperation to countries requesting assistance to build democratic institutions.
Promote dialogue among civilizations, to strengthen a culture of peace and respect for racial, religious and cultural diversity.

Democracy Caucus within the United Nations and Other Multilateral Fora to Support Democracy.
We will strengthen our process of informal consultation and coordination, wherever possible, at the UN and other international and regional organizations on democracy related issues, through, among others, informal coalitions and caucuses to support democracy.
To that end we will seek to,
Continue convening as an informal democracy caucus at the UN General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), in order to consult, coordinate possible actions and foster cooperation to deepen democratic governance, protect human rights, and to promote and improve democratic practices.
