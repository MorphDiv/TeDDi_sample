The Commission also urged all States to become parties to the Convention; called upon States to ensure that no reservation was incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention and to review their reservations with a view to withdrawing them; invited States ratifying or acceding to the Convention and those States parties that had not yet done so to make the declarations under articles 21 and 22 and urged States parties to notify the Secretary-General of their acceptance of the amendments to articles 17 and 18; and called upon States to consider signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol.
