DECLARATIONS CONCERNING PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION
1.
Declaration on Article I-6
The Conference notes that Article I-6 reflects existing case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and of the Court of First Instance.
2.
Declaration on Article I-9(2)
The Conference agrees that the Union's accession to the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms should be arranged in such a way as to preserve the specific features of Union law.
In this connection, the Conference notes the existence of a regular dialogue between the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights; such dialogue could be reinforced when the Union accedes to that Convention.
3.
Declaration on Articles I-22, I-27 and I-28
In choosing the persons called upon to hold the offices of President of the European Council, President of the Commission and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, due account is to be taken of the need to respect the geographical and demographic diversity of the Union and its Member States.
4.
Declaration on Article I-24(7) concerning the European Council decision on the exercise of the Presidency of the Council
The Conference declares that the Council should begin preparing the European decision establishing the measures for applying the European decision of the European Council on the exercise of the Presidency of the Council as soon as the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is signed and should give its political approval within six months.
A draft European decision of the European Council, which will be adopted on the date of entry into force of the said Treaty, is set out below:
DRAFT EUROPEAN DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON THE EXERCISE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE COUNCIL
Article 1
1.
The Presidency of the Council, with the exception of the Foreign Affairs configuration, shall be held by pre-established groups of three Member States for a period of 18 months.

Each member of the group shall in turn chair for a six-month period all configurations of the Council, with the exception of the Foreign Affairs configuration.
The other members of the group shall assist the Chair in all its responsibilities on the basis of a common programme.
Members of the team may decide alternative arrangements among themselves.
Article 2

The Member States holding the Presidency shall take all necessary measures for the organisation and smooth operation of the Council's work, with the assistance of the General Secretariat of the Council.
Article 4
The Council shall adopt a European decision establishing the measures for the implementation of this decision.
5.
Declaration on Article I-25
The Conference declares that the European decision relating to the implementation of Article I-25 will be adopted by the Council on the day the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe enters into force.
The draft decision is set out below:
DRAFT EUROPEAN DECISION OF THE COUNCIL RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE I-25
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Whereas:
(1)
Provisions should be adopted allowing for a smooth transition from the system for decision-making in the Council by a qualified majority as defined in the Treaty of Nice and set out in Article 2(2) of the Protocol on the transitional provisions relating to the institutions and bodies of the Union annexed to the Constitution, which will continue to apply until 31 October 2009, to the voting system provided for in Article I-25 of the Constitution, which will apply with effect from 1 November 2009.
(2)
It is recalled that it is the practice of the Council to devote every effort to strengthening the democratic legitimacy of decisions taken by a qualified majority.
(3)
It is judged appropriate to maintain this decision as long as is necessary to ensure smooth transition to the new voting system provided for in the Constitution,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1
If members of the Council, representing:
(a)
at least three quarters of the population; or
(b)
at least three quarters of the number of Member States.
necessary to constitute a blocking minority resulting from the application of Article I-25(1), first subparagraph, or Article I-25(2), indicate their opposition to the Council adopting an act by a qualified majority, the Council shall discuss the issue.
Article 2
The Council shall, in the course of these discussions, do all in its power to reach, within a reasonable time and without prejudicing obligatory time limits laid down by Union law, a satisfactory solution to address concerns raised by the members of the Council referred to in Article 1.
Article 3
To this end, the President of the Council, with the assistance of the Commission and in compliance with the Rules of Procedure of the Council, shall undertake any initiative necessary to facilitate a wider basis of agreement in the Council.
The members of the Council shall lend him or her their assistance.
Article 4
This decision shall take effect on 1 November 2009.
It shall remain in force at least until 2014.
Thereafter the Council may adopt a European decision repealing it.
6.
Declaration on Article I-26
The Conference considers that when the Commission no longer includes nationals of all Member States, the Commission should pay particular attention to the need to ensure full transparency in relations with all Member States.
Accordingly, the Commission should liaise closely with all Member States, whether or not they have a national serving as member of the Commission, and in this context pay special attention to the need to share information and consult with all Member States.
The Conference also considers that the Commission should take all the necessary measures to ensure that political, social and economic realities in all Member States, including those which have no national serving as member of the Commission, are fully taken into account.
These measures should include ensuring that the position of those Member States is addressed by appropriate organisational arrangements.
7.
Declaration on Article I-27
The Conference considers that, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the European Parliament and the European Council are jointly responsible for the smooth running of the process leading to the election of the President of the European Commission.
Prior to the decision of the European Council, representatives of the European Parliament and of the European Council will thus conduct the necessary consultations in the framework deemed the most appropriate.
These consultations will focus on the backgrounds of the candidates for President of the Commission, taking account of the elections to the European Parliament, in accordance with Article I-27(1).
The arrangements for such consultations may be determined, in due course, by common accord between the European Parliament and the European Council.
8.
Declaration on Article I-36
The Conference takes note of the Commission's intention to continue to consult experts appointed by the Member States in the preparation of draft delegated European regulations in the financial services area, in accordance with its established practice.
9.
Declaration on Articles I-43 and III-329
Without prejudice to the measures adopted by the Union to comply with its solidarity obligation towards a Member State which is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of natural or man-made disaster, none of the provisions of Articles I-43 and III-329 of the Constitution is intended to affect the right of another Member State to choose the most appropriate means to comply with its own solidarity obligation towards that Member State.
10.
Declaration on Article I-51
The Conference declares that, whenever rules on protection of personal data to be adopted on the basis of Article I-51 could have direct implications for national security, due account will have to be taken of the specific characteristics of the matter.
It recalls that the legislation presently applicable (see in particular Directive 95/46/EC) includes specific derogations in this regard.
11.
Declaration on Article I-57
The Union will take into account the particular situation of small-sized countries which maintain specific relations of proximity with it.
12.
Declaration concerning the explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights
The Conference takes note of the explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and updated under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention, as set out below.
EXPLANATIONS RELATING TO THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
These explanations were originally prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
They have been updated under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention, in the light of the drafting adjustments made to the text of the Charter by that Convention (notably to Articles 51 and 52(
1
)) and of further developments of Union law.
Although they do not as such have the status of law, they are a valuable tool of interpretation intended to clarify the provisions of the Charter.
PREAMBLE
The peoples of Europe, in creating an ever closer union among them, are resolved to share a peaceful future based on common values.
Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
The Union contributes to the preservation and to the development of these common values while respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe as well as the national identities of the Member States and the organisation of their public authorities at national, regional and local levels; it seeks to promote balanced and sustainable development and ensures free movement of persons, services, goods and capital, and the freedom of establishment.
To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes in society, social progress and scientific and technological developments by making those rights more visible in a Charter.
This Charter reaffirms, with due regard for the powers and tasks of the Union and the principle of subsidiarity, the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to the Member States, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Social Charters adopted by the Union and by the Council of Europe and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the European Court of Human Rights.
In this context the Charter will be interpreted by the courts of the Union and the Member States with due regard to the explanations prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and updated under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention.
Enjoyment of these rights entails responsibilities and duties with regard to other persons, to the human community and to future generations.
The Union therefore recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out hereafter.
TITLE I
DIGNITY
2
)
Human dignity
Human dignity is inviolable.
It must be respected and protected.
Explanation
The dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis of fundamental rights.
The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrined human dignity in its preamble: &#x2018; Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. &#x2019; In its judgment of 9 October 2001 in case C-377/98 Netherlands v European Parliament and Council [2001] ECR 7079, at grounds  70 to 77, the Court of Justice confirmed that a fundamental right to human dignity is part of Union law.
It results that none of the rights laid down in this Charter may be used to harm the dignity of another person, and that the dignity of the human person is part of the substance of the rights laid down in this Charter.
It must therefore be respected, even where a right is restricted.
3
)
Right to life
1.
Everyone has the right to life.
2.
No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed.
Explanation
1.
&#x2018; 1.
Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law... &#x2019;
2.
&#x2018; The death penalty shall be abolished.
No-one shall be condemned to such penalty or executed. &#x2019;
Article 2(2) of the Charter(
4
) is based on that provision.
3.
3
) correspond to those of the above Articles of the ECHR and its Protocol.
They have the same meaning and the same scope, in accordance with Article 52(3) of the Charter(
5
).
Therefore, the &#x2018; negative &#x2019; definitions appearing in the ECHR must be regarded as also forming part of the Charter:
(a)
&#x2018; Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:
(a)
in defence of any person from unlawful violence;
(b)
in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;
(c)
in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection. &#x2019;
(b)
&#x2018; A State may make provision in its law for the death penalty in respect of acts committed in time of war or of imminent threat of war; such penalty shall be applied only in the instances laid down in the law and in accordance with its provisions... &#x2019;
6
)
Right to the integrity of the person
1.
Everyone has the right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity.
2.
In the fields of medicine and biology, the following must be respected in particular:
(a)
the free and informed consent of the person concerned, according to the procedures laid down by law;
(b)
the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at the selection of persons;
(c)
the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain;
(d)
the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of human beings.
Explanation
1.
In its judgment of 9 October 2001 in case C-377/98 Netherlands v European Parliament and Council [2001] ECR 7079, at grounds  70, 78 to 80, the Court of Justice confirmed that a fundamental right to human integrity is part of Union law and encompasses, in the context of medicine and biology, the free and informed consent of the donor and recipient.
2.
7
) are already included in the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, adopted by the Council of Europe (ETS 164 and additional protocol ETS 168).
The Charter does not set out to depart from those principles, and therefore prohibits only reproductive cloning.
It neither authorises nor prohibits other forms of cloning.
Thus it does not in any way prevent the legislature from prohibiting other forms of cloning.
3.
The reference to eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at the selection of persons, relates to possible situations in which selection programmes are organised and implemented, involving campaigns for sterilisation, forced pregnancy, compulsory ethnic marriage among others, all acts deemed to be international crimes in the Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted in Rome on 17 July 1998 (see its Article 7(1)(g)).
8
)
Prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Explanation
The right in Article 4(
8
) is the right guaranteed by Article 3 of the ECHR, which has the same wording: &#x2018; No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment &#x2019; .
By virtue of Article 52(3) of the Charter(
9
), it therefore has the same meaning and the same scope as the ECHR Article.
10
)
Prohibition of slavery and forced labour
1.
No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.2.
No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.
3.
Trafficking in human beings is prohibited.
Explanation
1.
11
) corresponds to Article 4(1) and (2) of the ECHR, which has the same wording.
It therefore has the same meaning and scope as the ECHR Article, by virtue of Article 52(3) of the Charter(
12
).
Consequently:
-
no limitation may legitimately affect the right provided for in paragraph 1;
-
&#x2018; For the purpose of this article the term &#x201C; forced or compulsory labour &#x201D; shall not include:
(a)
any work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention imposed according to the provisions of Article 5 of this Convention or during conditional release from such detention;
(b)
any service of a military character or, in case of conscientious objectors in countries where they are recognised, service exacted instead of compulsory military service;
(c)
any service exacted in case of an emergency or calamity threatening the life or well-being of the community;
(d)
any work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations. &#x2019;
2.
acquis
, in which the United Kingdom and Ireland participate, contains the following wording in Article 27(1) which refers to illegal immigration networks: &#x2018; The Contracting Parties undertake to impose appropriate penalties on any person who, for financial gain, assists or tries to assist an alien to enter or reside within the territory of one of the Contracting Parties in breach of that Contracting Party's laws on the entry and residence of aliens. &#x2019; On 19 July 2002, the Council adopted a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings (OJ L 203/1) whose Article 1 defines in detail the offences concerning trafficking in human beings for the purposes of labour exploitation or sexual exploitation, which the Member States must make punishable by virtue of that framework decision.
TITLE II
FREEDOMS
13
)
Right to liberty and security
Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.
Explanation
The rights in Article 6(
13
) are the rights guaranteed by Article 5 of the ECHR, and in accordance with Article 52(3) of the Charter(
14
), they have the same meaning and scope.
Consequently, the limitations which may legitimately be imposed on them may not exceed those permitted by the ECHR, in the wording of Article 5:
&#x2018; 1.
(a)
the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;
(b)
the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;
(c)
the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;
(d)
the detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of educational supervision or his lawful detention for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority;
(e)
the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;
(f)
the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.
2.
Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.
3.
Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.
Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.
4.
Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.
5.
Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation. &#x2019;
The rights enshrined in Article 6(
15
) must be respected particularly when the European Parliament and the Council adopt laws and framework laws in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, on the basis of Articles III-270, III-271 and III-273 of the Constitution, notably to define common minimum provisions as regards the categorisation of offences and punishments and certain aspects of procedural law.
16
)
Respect for private and family life
Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications.
Explanation
The rights guaranteed in Article 7(
16
) correspond to those guaranteed by Article 8 of the ECHR.
To take account of developments in technology the word &#x2018; correspondence &#x2019; has been replaced by &#x2018; communications &#x2019; .
In accordance with Article 52(3)(
17
), the meaning and scope of this right are the same as those of the corresponding article of the ECHR.
Consequently, the limitations which may legitimately be imposed on this right are the same as those allowed by Article 8 of the ECHR:
&#x2018; 1.
Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
2.
There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. &#x2019;
18
)
Protection of personal data
1.
Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.2.
Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law.
Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.
3.
Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority.
Explanation
This Article has been based on Article 286 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (
OJ L 281, 23.11.1995
) as well as on Article 8 of the ECHR and on the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, which has been ratified by all the Member States.
Article 286 of the EC Treaty is now replaced by Article I-51 of the Constitution.
Reference is also made to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (
OJ L 8, 12.1.2001
).
The abovementioned Directive and Regulation contain conditions and limitations for the exercise of the right to the protection of personal data.
19
)
Right to marry and right to found a family
The right to marry and the right to found a family shall be guaranteed in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of these rights.
Explanation
This Article is based on Article 12 of the ECHR, which reads as follows: &#x2018; Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family according to the national laws governing the exercising of this right. &#x2019; The wording of the Article has been modernised to cover cases in which national legislation recognises arrangements other than marriage for founding a family.
This Article neither prohibits nor imposes the granting of the status of marriage to unions between people of the same sex.
This right is thus similar to that afforded by the ECHR, but its scope may be wider when national legislation so provides.
20
)
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion
1.
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
This right includes freedom to change religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or in private, to manifest religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.
2.
The right to conscientious objection is recognised, in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of this right.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in paragraph 1 corresponds to the right guaranteed in Article 9 of the ECHR and, in accordance with Article 52(3) of the Charter(
21
), has the same meaning and scope.
Limitations must therefore respect Article 9(2) of the Convention, which reads as follows: &#x2018; Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. &#x2019;
The right guaranteed in paragraph 2 corresponds to national constitutional traditions and to the development of national legislation on this issue.

1.
Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.
This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.
2.
The freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.
Explanation
1.
22
) corresponds to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which reads as follows:
&#x2018; 1.
Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.
This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.
This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.
2.
The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. &#x2019;
Pursuant to Article 52(3) of the Charter(
23
), the meaning and scope of this right are the same as those guaranteed by the ECHR.
The limitations which may be imposed on it may therefore not exceed those provided for in Article 10(2) of the Convention, without prejudice to any restrictions which competition law of the Union may impose on Member States' right to introduce the licensing arrangements referred to in the third sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECHR.
2.
Paragraph 2 of this Article spells out the consequences of paragraph 1 regarding freedom of the media.
It is based in particular on Court of Justice case-law regarding television, particularly in case C-288/89 (judgment of 25 July 1991, Stichting Collectieve Antennevoorziening Gouda and others [1991] ECR I-4007), and on the Protocol on the system of public broadcasting in the Member States annexed to the EC Treaty and now to the Constitution, and on Council Directive 89/552/EC (particularly its seventeenth recital).
24
)
Freedom of assembly and of association
1.
Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association at all levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters, which implies the right of everyone to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his or her interests.
2.
Political parties at Union level contribute to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union.
Explanation

), limitations on that right may not exceed those considered legitimate by virtue of Article 11(2) of the ECHR.
2.
This right is also based on Article 11 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.
3.
Paragraph 2 of this Article corresponds to Article I-46(4) of the Constitution.
26
)
Freedom of the arts and sciences
The arts and scientific research shall be free of constraint.
Academic freedom shall be respected.
Explanation
This right is deduced primarily from the right to freedom of thought and expression.
It is to be exercised having regard to Article 1(
27
) and may be subject to the limitations authorised by Article 10 of the ECHR.
28
)
Right to education
1.
Everyone has the right to education and to have access to vocational and continuing training.2.
This right includes the possibility to receive free compulsory education.
3.
The freedom to found educational establishments with due respect for democratic principles and the right of parents to ensure the education and teaching of their children in conformity with their religious, philosophical and pedagogical convictions shall be respected, in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of such freedom and right.
Explanation
1.
&#x2018; No person shall be denied the right to education.
In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions. &#x2019;
It was considered useful to extend this article to access to vocational and continuing training (see point 15 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers and Article 10 of the Social Charter) and to add the principle of free compulsory education.
As it is worded, the latter principle merely implies that as regards compulsory education, each child has the possibility of attending an establishment which offers free education.
It does not require all establishments which provide education or vocational and continuing training, in particular private ones, to be free of charge.
Nor does it exclude certain specific forms of education having to be paid for, if the State takes measures to grant financial compensation.
Insofar as the Charter applies to the Union, this means that in its training policies the Union must respect free compulsory education, but this does not, of course, create new powers.
Regarding the right of parents, it must be interpreted in conjunction with the provisions of Article 24(
29
).
2.
Freedom to found public or private educational establishments is guaranteed as one of the aspects of freedom to conduct a business but it is limited by respect for democratic principles and is exercised in accordance with the arrangements defined by national legislation.

)
Freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work
1.
Everyone has the right to engage in work and to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation.2.
Every citizen of the Union has the freedom to seek employment, to work, to exercise the right of establishment and to provide services in any Member State.
3.
Nationals of third countries who are authorised to work in the territories of the Member States are entitled to working conditions equivalent to those of citizens of the Union.
Explanation
Freedom to choose an occupation, as enshrined in Article 15(1)(
30
), is recognised in Court of Justice case-law (see

Freedom to conduct a business
The freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices is recognised.
Explanation
This Article is based on Court of Justice case-law which has recognised freedom to exercise an economic or commercial activity (see judgments of 14 May 1974, Case 4/73 Nold [1974] ECR 491, paragraph 14 of the grounds, and of 27 September 1979, Case 230-78 SPA Eridiana and others [1979] ECR 2749, paragraphs 20 and 31 of the grounds) and freedom of contract (see
inter alia
Sukkerfabriken Nykøbing judgment, Case 151/78 [1979] ECR 1, paragraph 19 of the grounds, and judgment of 5 October 1999, C-240/97 Spain v Commission, [1999] ECR I-6571, paragraph 99 of the grounds) and Article I-3(2) of the Constitution, which recognises free competition.
Of course, this right is to be exercised with respect for Union law and national legislation.
It may be subject to the limitations provided for in Article 52(1) of the Charter(
33
).
34
)
Right to property
1.
Everyone has the right to own, use, dispose of and bequeath his or her lawfully acquired possessions.
No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss.
The use of property may be regulated by law insofar as is necessary for the general interest.
2.
Intellectual property shall be protected.
Explanation
This Article is based on Article 1 of the Protocol to the ECHR:
&#x2018; Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.
No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.
The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties. &#x2019;
This is a fundamental right common to all national constitutions.
It has been recognised on numerous occasions by the case-law of the Court of Justice, initially in the Hauer judgment (13 December 1979, ECR [1979] 3727).
The wording has been updated but, in accordance with Article 52(3)(
35
), the meaning and scope of the right are the same as those of the right guaranteed by the ECHR and the limitations may not exceed those provided for there.
Protection of intellectual property, one aspect of the right of property, is explicitly mentioned in paragraph 2 because of its growing importance and Community secondary legislation.
Intellectual property covers not only literary and artistic property but also inter alia patent and trademark rights and associated rights.
The guarantees laid down in paragraph 1 shall apply as appropriate to intellectual property.
36
)
Right to asylum
The right to asylum shall be guaranteed with due respect for the rules of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 and the Protocol of 31 January 1967 relating to the status of refugees and in accordance with the Constitution.
Explanation
The text of the Article has been based on TEC Article 63, now replaced by Article III-266 of the Constitution, which requires the Union to respect the Geneva Convention on refugees.
Reference should be made to the Protocols relating to the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the [Treaty of Amsterdam] Constitution and to Denmark to determine the extent to which those Member States implement Union law in this area and the extent to which this Article is applicable to them.
This Article is in line with the Protocol on Asylum annexed to the Constitution.
37
)
Protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition
1.
Collective expulsions are prohibited.
2.
No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Explanation
Paragraph 1 of this Article has the same meaning and scope as Article 4 of Protocol  4 to the ECHR concerning collective expulsion.
Its purpose is to guarantee that every decision is based on a specific examination and that no single measure can be taken to expel all persons having the nationality of a particular State (see also Article 13 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights).
Paragraph 2 incorporates the relevant case-law from the European Court of Human Rights regarding Article 3 of the ECHR (see Ahmed v Austria, judgment of 17 December 1996, [1996] ECR VI-2206 and Soering, judgment of 7 July 1989).
TITLE III
EQUALITY
38
)
Equality before the law
Everyone is equal before the law.
Explanation
This Article corresponds to a general principle of law which is included in all European constitutions and has also been recognised by the Court of Justice as a basic principle of Community law (judgment of 13 November 1984, Case 283/83 Racke [1984] ECR 3791, judgment of 17 April 1997, Case 15/95 EARL [1997] ECR I-1961, and judgment of 13 April 2000, Case 292/97 Karlsson [2000] ECR 2737).

)
Non-discrimination
1.
Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.
2.
Within the scope of application of the Constitution and without prejudice to any of its specific provisions, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.
Explanation
Paragraph 1 draws on Article 13 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-124 of the Constitution, Article 14 of the ECHR and Article 11 of the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine as regards genetic heritage.
Insofar as this corresponds to Article 14 of the ECHR, it applies in compliance with it.
There is no contradiction or incompatibility between paragraph 1 and Article III-124 of the Constitution which has a different scope and purpose:
Article III-124 confers power on the Union to adopt legislative acts, including harmonisation of the Member States' laws and regulations, to combat certain forms of discrimination, listed exhaustively in that Article.
Such legislation may cover action of Member State authorities (as well as relations between private individuals) in any area within the limits of the Union's powers.
In contrast, the provision in paragraph 1 does not create any power to enact anti-discrimination laws in these areas of Member State or private action, nor does it lay down a sweeping ban of discrimination in such wide-ranging areas.
Instead, it only addresses discriminations by the institutions and bodies of the Union themselves, when exercising powers conferred under other articles of Parts I and III of the Constitution, and by Member States only when they are implementing Union law.
Paragraph 1 therefore does not alter the extent of powers granted under Article III-124 nor the interpretation given to that Article.
Paragraph 2 corresponds to Article I-4(2) of the Constitution and must be applied in compliance with that Article.
40
)
Cultural, religious and linguistic diversity
The Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.
Explanation
This Article has been based on Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and on Article 151(1) and (4) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-280(1) and (4) of the Constitution, concerning culture.
Respect for cultural and linguistic diversity is now also laid down in Article I-3(3) of the Constitution.
The Article is also inspired by Declaration No 11 to the Final Act of the Amsterdam Treaty on the status of churches and non-confessional organisations, now taken over in Article I-52 of the Constitution.
41
)
Equality between women and men
Equality between women and men must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and pay.
The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.
Explanation
The first paragraph has been based on Articles 2 and 3(2) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Articles I-3 and III-116 of the Constitution which impose the objective of promoting equality between men and women on the Union, and on Article 141(1) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-214(1) of the Constitution.
It draws on Article 20 of the revised European Social Charter of 3 May 1996 and on point 16 of the Community Charter on the rights of workers.
It is also based on Article 141(3) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-214(3) of the Constitution, and Article 2(4) of Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.
The second paragraph takes over in shorter form Article III-214(4) of the Constitution which provides that the principle of equal treatment does not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.
In accordance with Article 52(2)(
42
), the present paragraph does not amend Article III-214(4).

3.
Every child shall have the right to maintain on a regular basis a personal relationship and direct contact with both his or her parents, unless that is contrary to his or her interests.
Explanation
This Article is based on the New York Convention on the Rights of the Child signed on 20 November 1989 and ratified by all the Member States, particularly Articles 3, 9, 12 and 13 thereof.
Paragraph 3 takes account of the fact that, as part of the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, Union legislation on civil matters having cross-border implications, for which Article III-269 of the Constitution confers power, may include notably visiting rights ensuring that children can maintain on a regular basis a personal and direct contact with both his or her parents.

Explanation
Article 41(
61

inter alia
, good administration as a general principle of law (see,
inter alia
, Court of Justice judgment of 31 March 1992 in Case C-255/90 P, Burban [1992] ECR I-2253, and Court of First Instance judgments of 18 September 1995 in Case T-167/94 Nölle [1995] ECR II-2589, and 9 July 1999 in Case T-231/97 New Europe Consulting and others [1999] ECR II-2403).
The wording for that right in the first two paragraphs results from the case-law (Court of Justice judgment of 15 October 1987 in Case 222/86 Heylens [1987] ECR 4097, paragraph 15 of the grounds, judgment of 18 October 1989 in Case 374/87 Orkem [1989] ECR 3283, judgment of 21 November 1991 in Case C-269/90 TU München [1991] ECR I-5469, and Court of First Instance judgments of 6 December 1994 in Case T-450/93 Lisrestal [1994] ECR II-1177, 18 September 1995 in Case T-167/94 Nölle [1995] ECR II-258) and the wording regarding the obligation to give reasons comes from Article 253 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article I-38(2) of the Constitution (see also the legal base in Article III-398 of the Constitution for the adoption of legislation in the interest of an open, efficient and independent European administration).
Paragraph 3 reproduces the right now guaranteed by Article III-431 of the Constitution.
Paragraph 4 reproduces the right now guaranteed by Articles I-10(2)(d) and III-129 of the Constitution.
In accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter(

&#x2018; Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity. &#x2019;
However, in Union law the protection is more extensive since it guarantees the right to an effective remedy before a court.
The Court of Justice enshrined that right in its judgment of 15 May 1986 as a general principle of Union law (Case 222/84 Johnston [1986] ECR 1651; see also judgment of 15 October 1987, Case 222/86 Heylens [1987] ECR 4097 and judgment of 3 December 1992, Case C-97/91 Borelli [1992] ECR I-6313).
According to the Court, that general principle of Union law also applies to the Member States when they are implementing Union law.
The inclusion of this precedent in the Charter has not been intended to change the system of judicial review laid down by the Treaties, and particularly the rules relating to admissibility for direct actions before the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The European Convention has considered the Union's system of judicial review including the rules on admissibility, and confirmed them while amending them as to certain aspects, as reflected in Articles III-353 to III-381 of the Constitution, and in particular in Article III-365(4).
Article 47(
70
) applies to the institutions of the Union and of Member States when they are implementing Union law and does so for all rights guaranteed by Union law.
The second paragraph corresponds to Article 6(1) of the ECHR which reads as follows:
&#x2018; In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.
Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. &#x2019;
In Union law, the right to a fair hearing is not confined to disputes relating to civil law rights and obligations.
That is one of the consequences of the fact that the Union is a community based on the rule of law as stated by the Court in Case 294/83, &#x2018; Les Verts &#x2019; v European Parliament (judgment of 23 April 1986, [1988] ECR 1339).
Nevertheless, in all respects other than their scope, the guarantees afforded by the ECHR apply in a similar way to the Union.
With regard to the third paragraph, it should be noted that in accordance with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, provision should be made for legal aid where the absence of such aid would make it impossible to ensure an effective remedy (ECHR Judgment of 9 October 1979, Airey, Series A, Volume 32, 11).
There is also a system of legal assistance for cases before the Court of Justice of the European Union.

)
Presumption of innocence and right of defence
1.
Everyone who has been charged shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.
2.
Respect for the rights of the defence of anyone who has been charged shall be guaranteed.
Explanation
Article 48(
71
) is the same as Article 6(2) and (3) of the ECHR, which reads as follows:
&#x2018; 2.
Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.
3.
Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:
(a)
to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;
(b)
to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;
(c)
to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;
(d)
to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;
(e)
to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court. &#x2019;
In accordance with Article 52(3)(
72
), this right has the same meaning and scope as the right guaranteed by the ECHR.

Principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties
1.
No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national law or international law at the time when it was committed.
Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than that which was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.
If, subsequent to the commission of a criminal offence, the law provides for a lighter penalty, that penalty shall be applicable.2.
This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles recognised by the community of nations.
3.
The severity of penalties must not be disproportionate to the criminal offence.
Explanation
This Article follows the traditional rule of the non-retroactivity of laws and criminal sanctions.
There has been added the rule of the retroactivity of a more lenient penal law, which exists in a number of Member States and which features in Article 15 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Article 7 of the ECHR is worded as follows:
&#x2018; 1.
No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed.
Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.
2.
This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations. &#x2019;
In paragraph 2, the reference to &#x2018; civilised &#x2019; nations has been deleted; this does not change the meaning of this paragraph, which refers to crimes against humanity in particular.
In accordance with Article 52(3)(
74
), the right guaranteed here therefore has the same meaning and scope as the right guaranteed by the ECHR.
Paragraph 3 states the general principle of proportionality between penalties and criminal offences which is enshrined in the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and in the case-law of the Court of Justice of the Communities.
75
)
Right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence
No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings for an offence for which he or she has already been finally acquitted or convicted within the Union in accordance with the law.
Explanation
Article 4 of Protocol No 7 to the ECHR reads as follows:
&#x2018; 1.
No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.
2.
The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law and the penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.
3.
No derogation from this Article shall be made under Article 15 of the Convention. &#x2019;
The &#x2018; non bis in idem &#x2019; rule applies in Union law (see, among the many precedents, the judgment of 5 May 1966, Cases 18/65 and 35/65, Gutmann v Commission [1966] ECR 103 and a recent case, the decision of the Court of First Instance of 20 April 1999, Joined Cases T-305/94 and others, Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij NV v.
Commission [1999] ECR II-931).
The rule prohibiting cumulation refers to cumulation of two penalties of the same kind, that is to say criminal law penalties.
In accordance with Article 50(
75
), the &#x2018; non bis in idem &#x2019; rule applies not only within the jurisdiction of one State but also between the jurisdictions of several Member States.
That corresponds to the
acquis
in Union law; see Articles 54 to 58 of the Schengen Convention and the judgment of the Court of Justice of 11 February 2003, C-187/01 Gözütok (not yet published), Article 7 of the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests and Article 10 of the Convention on the fight against corruption.
The very limited exceptions in those Conventions permitting the Member States to derogate from the &#x2018; non bis in idem &#x2019; rule are covered by the horizontal clause in Article 52(1) of the Charter(
76
) concerning limitations.
As regards the situations referred to by Article 4 of Protocol No 7, namely the application of the principle within the same Member State, the guaranteed right has the same meaning and the same scope as the corresponding right in the ECHR.
TITLE VII
GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER
77
)
Field of application
1.
The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law.
They shall therefore respect the rights, observe the principles and promote the application thereof in accordance with their respective powers and respecting the limits of the powers of the Union as conferred on it in the other Parts of the Constitution.
2.
This Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined in the other Parts of the Constitution.
Explanation
The aim of Article 51(
77
) is to determine the scope of the Charter.
It seeks to establish clearly that the Charter applies primarily to the institutions and bodies of the Union, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.
This provision was drafted in keeping with Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which required the Union to respect fundamental rights, and with the mandate issued by Cologne European Council.
The term &#x2018; institutions &#x2019; is enshrined in Part I of the Constitution.
The expression &#x2018; bodies, offices and agencies &#x2019; is commonly used in the Constitution to refer to all the authorities set up by the Constitution or by secondary legislation (see, e.g., Articles I-50 or I-51 of the Constitution).
As regards the Member States, it follows unambiguously from the case-law of the Court of Justice that the requirement to respect fundamental rights defined in a Union context is only binding on the Member States when they act in the scope of Union law (judgment of 13 July 1989, Case 5/88 Wachauf [1989] ECR 2609; judgment of 18 June 1991, ERT [1991] ECR I-2925); judgment of 18 December 1997 (C-309/96 Annibaldi [1997] ECR I-7493).
The Court of Justice confirmed this case-law in the following terms: &#x2018; In addition, it should be remembered that the requirements flowing from the protection of fundamental rights in the Community legal order are also binding on Member States when they implement Community rules ... &#x2019; (judgment of 13 April 2000, Case C-292/97, [2000] ECR 2737, paragraph 37 of the grounds).
Of course this rule, as enshrined in this Charter, applies to the central authorities as well as to regional or local bodies, and to public organisations, when they are implementing Union law.
Paragraph 2, together with the second sentence of paragraph 1, confirms that the Charter may not have the effect of extending the competences and tasks which the other Parts of the Constitution confer on the Union.
Explicit mention is made here of the logical consequences of the principle of subsidiarity and of the fact that the Union only has those powers which have been conferred upon it.
The fundamental rights as guaranteed in the Union do not have any effect other than in the context of the powers determined by Parts I and III of the Constitution.
Consequently, an obligation, pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph 1, for the Union's institutions to promote principles laid down in the Charter, may arise only within the limits of these same powers.
Paragraph 2 also confirms that the Charter may not have the effect of extending the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union as established in the other Parts of the Constitution.
The Court of Justice has already established this rule with respect to the fundamental rights recognised as part of Union law (judgment of 17 February 1998, C-249/96 Grant, 1998 ECR I-621, paragraph 45 of the grounds).
In accordance with this rule, it goes without saying that the incorporation of the Charter into the Constitution cannot be understood as extending by itself the range of Member State action considered to be &#x2018; implementation of Union law &#x2019; (within the meaning of paragraph 1 and the above-mentioned case-law).
78
)
Scope and interpretation of rights and principles
1.
Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by this Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms.
Subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.2.
Rights recognised by this Charter for which provision is made in other Parts of the Constitution shall be exercised under the conditions and within the limits defined by these relevant Parts.3.
Insofar as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention.
This provision shall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.4.
Insofar as this Charter recognises fundamental rights as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, those rights shall be interpreted in harmony with those traditions.5.
The provisions of this Charter which contain principles may be implemented by legislative and executive acts taken by institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, and by acts of Member States when they are implementing Union law, in the exercise of their respective powers.
They shall be judicially cognisable only in the interpretation of such acts and in the ruling on their legality.6.
Full account shall be taken of national laws and practices as specified in this Charter.
7.
The explanations drawn up as a way of providing guidance in the interpretation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights shall be given due regard by the courts of the Union and of the Member States.
Explanation
The purpose of Article 52(
79
) is to set the scope of the rights and principles of the Charter, and to lay down rules for their interpretation.
Paragraph 1 deals with the arrangements for the limitation of rights.
The wording is based on the case-law of the Court of Justice: &#x2018; ... it is well established in the case-law of the Court that restrictions may be imposed on the exercise of fundamental rights, in particular in the context of a common organisation of the market, provided that those restrictions in fact correspond to objectives of general interest pursued by the Community and do not constitute, with regard to the aim pursued, disproportionate and unreasonable interference undermining the very substance of those rights &#x2019; (judgment of 13 April 2000, Case C-292/97, paragraph 45 of the grounds).
The reference to general interests recognised by the Union covers both the objectives mentioned in Article I-2 of the Constitution and other interests protected by specific provisions of the Constitution such as Articles I-5(1), III-133(3), III-154 and III-436.
Paragraph 2 refers to rights which were already expressly guaranteed in the Treaty establishing the European Community and have been recognised in the Charter, and which are now found in other Parts of the Constitution (notably the rights derived from Union citizenship).
It clarifies that such rights remain subject to the conditions and limits applicable to the Union law on which they are based, and for which provision is now made in Parts I and III of the Constitution.
The Charter does not alter the system of rights conferred by the EC Treaty and now taken over by Parts I and III of the Constitution.
Paragraph 3 is intended to ensure the necessary consistency between the Charter and the ECHR by establishing the rule that, insofar as the rights in the present Charter also correspond to rights guaranteed by the ECHR, the meaning and scope of those rights, including authorised limitations, are the same as those laid down by the ECHR.
This means in particular that the legislator, in laying down limitations to those rights, must comply with the same standards as are fixed by the detailed limitation arrangements laid down in the ECHR, which are thus made applicable for the rights covered by this paragraph, without thereby adversely affecting the autonomy of Union law and of that of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The reference to the ECHR covers both the Convention and the Protocols to it.
The meaning and the scope of the guaranteed rights are determined not only by the text of those instruments, but also by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The last sentence of the paragraph is designed to allow the Union to guarantee more extensive protection.
In any event, the level of protection afforded by the Charter may never be lower than that guaranteed by the ECHR.
The Charter does not affect the possibilities of Member States to avail themselves of Article 15 ECHR, allowing derogations from ECHR rights in the event of war or of other public dangers threatening the life of the nation, when they take action in the areas of national defence in the event of war and of the maintenance of law and order, in accordance with their responsibilities recognised in Articles I-5 (1), III-131, III-262 of the Constitution.
The list of rights which may at the present stage, without precluding developments in the law, legislation and the Treaties, be regarded as corresponding to rights in the ECHR within the meaning of the present paragraph is given hereafter.
It does not include rights additional to those in the ECHR.

-
Finally, citizens of the European Union may not be considered as aliens in the scope of the application of Union law, because of the prohibition of any discrimination on grounds of nationality.
The limitations provided for by Article 16 of the ECHR as regards the rights of aliens therefore do not apply to them in this context.
The rule of interpretation contained in paragraph 4 has been based on the wording of Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union (cf. now the wording of Article I-9(3) of the Constitution) and takes due account of the approach to common constitutional traditions followed by the Court of Justice (e.g., judgment of 13 December 1979, Case 44/79 Hauer [1979] ECR 3727; judgment of 18 May 1982, Case 155/79, AM & S, [1982] ECR 1575).
Under that rule, rather than following a rigid approach of &#x2018; a lowest common denominator &#x2019; , the Charter rights concerned should be interpreted in a way offering a high standard of protection which is adequate for the law of the Union and in harmony with the common constitutional traditions.
Paragraph 5 clarifies the distinction between &#x2018; rights &#x2019; and &#x2018; principles &#x2019; set out in the Charter.
According to that distinction, subjective rights shall be respected, whereas principles shall be observed (Article 51 (1))(
96
).
Principles may be implemented through legislative or executive acts (adopted by the Union in accordance with its powers, and by the Member States only when they implement Union law); accordingly, they become significant for the Courts only when such acts are interpreted or reviewed.
They do not however give rise to direct claims for positive action by the Union's institutions or Member States authorities.
This is consistent both with case-law of the Court of Justice (Cf. notably case-law on the &#x2018; precautionary principle &#x2019; in Article 174 (2) TEC (replaced by Article III-233 of the Constitution): judgment of the CFI of 11 September 2002, T-13/99, Pfizer vs.
Council, with numerous references to earlier case-law; and a series of judgments on Article 33 (ex 39) on the principles of agricultural law, e.g. judgment of the Court of Justice C-265/85, Van den Berg, 1987 ECR 1155: scrutiny of the principle of market stabilisation and of reasonable expectations) and with the approach of the Member States' constitutional systems to &#x2018; principles &#x2019; particularly in the field of social law.
For illustration, examples for principles recognised in the Charter include e.g.
Articles 25, 26 and 37(
97
).
In some cases, an Article of the Charter may contain both elements of a right and of a principle, e.g.
Articles 23, 33 and 34(
98
Paragraph 6 refers to the various Articles in the Charter which, in the spirit of subsidiarity, make reference to national laws and practices.

)
Level of protection
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as restricting or adversely affecting human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognised, in their respective fields of application, by Union law and international law and by international agreements to which the Union or all the Member States are party, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and by the Member States' constitutions.
Explanation
This provision is intended to maintain the level of protection currently afforded within their respective scope by Union law, national law and international law.
Owing to its importance, mention is made of the ECHR.

)
Prohibition of abuse of rights
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as implying any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms recognised in this Charter or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for herein.
Explanation
This Article corresponds to Article 17 of the ECHR:
&#x2018; Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention. &#x2019;
13.
Declaration on Article III-116
The Conference agrees that, in its general efforts to eliminate inequalities between women and men, the Union will aim in its different policies to combat all kinds of domestic violence.
The Member States should take all necessary measures to prevent and punish these criminal acts and to support and protect the victims.
14.
Declaration on Articles III-136 and III-267
The Conference considers that in the event that a draft European law or framework law based on Article III-267(2) would affect fundamental aspects of the social security system of a Member State, including its scope, cost or financial structure, or would affect the financial balance of that system as set out in Article III-136(2), the interests of that Member State will be duly taken into account.
15.
Declaration on Articles III-160 and III-322
The Conference recalls that the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms implies, in particular, that proper attention is given to the protection and observance of the due process rights of the individuals or entities concerned.
For this purpose and in order to guarantee a thorough judicial review of European decisions subjecting an individual or entity to restrictive measures, such decisions must be based on clear and distinct criteria.
These criteria should be tailored to the specifics of each restrictive measure.
16.
Declaration on Article III-167(2)(c)
The Conference notes that Article III-167(2)(c) shall be interpreted in accordance with the existing case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and of the Court of First Instance regarding the applicability of the provisions to aid granted to certain areas of the Federal Republic of Germany affected by the former division of Germany.
17.
Declaration on Article III-184
With regard to Article III-184, the Conference confirms that raising growth potential and securing sound budgetary positions are the two pillars of the economic and fiscal policy of the Union and the Member States.
The Stability and Growth Pact is an important tool to achieve these goals.
The Conference reaffirms its commitment to the provisions concerning the Stability and Growth Pact as the framework for the coordination of budgetary policies in the Member States.
The Conference confirms that a rule-based system is the best guarantee for commitments to be enforced and for all Member States to be treated equally.
Within this framework, the Conference also reaffirms its commitment to the goals of the Lisbon Strategy: job creation, structural reforms, and social cohesion.
The Union aims at achieving balanced economic growth and price stability.
Economic and budgetary policies thus need to set the right priorities towards economic reforms, innovation, competitiveness and strengthening of private investment and consumption in phases of weak economic growth.
This should be reflected in the orientations of budgetary decisions at the national and Union level in particular through restructuring of public revenue and expenditure while respecting budgetary discipline in accordance with the Constitution and the Stability and Growth Pact.
Budgetary and economic challenges facing the Member States underline the importance of sound budgetary policy throughout the economic cycle.
The Conference agrees that Member States should use periods of economic recovery actively to consolidate public finances and improve their budgetary positions.
The objective is to gradually achieve a budgetary surplus in good times which creates the necessary room to accommodate economic downturns and thus contribute to the long-term sustainability of public finances.
The Member States look forward to possible proposals of the Commission as well as further contributions of Member States with regard to strengthening and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The Member States will take all necessary measures to raise the growth potential of their economies.
Improved economic policy coordination could support this objective.
This Declaration does not prejudge the future debate on the Stability and Growth Pact.
18.
Declaration on Article III-213
The Conference confirms that the policies described in Article III-213 fall essentially within the competence of the Member States.
Measures to provide encouragement and promote coordination to be taken at Union level in accordance with this Article shall be of a complementary nature.
They shall serve to strengthen cooperation between Member States and not to harmonise national systems.
The guarantees and practices existing in each Member State as regards the responsibility of the social partners will not be affected.
This Declaration is without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution conferring competence on the Union, including in social matters.
19.
Declaration on Article III-220
The Conference considers that the reference in Article III-220 to island regions can include island States in their entirety, subject to the necessary criteria being met.
20.
Declaration on Article III-243
The Conference notes that the provisions of Article III-243 shall be applied in accordance with the current practice.
The terms &#x2018; such measures are required in order to compensate for the economic disadvantages caused by the division of Germany to the economy of certain areas of the Federal Republic affected by that division &#x2019; shall be interpreted in accordance with the existing case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and of the Court of First Instance.
21.
Declaration on Article III-248
The Conference agrees that the Union's action in the area of research and technological development will pay due respect to the fundamental orientations and choices of the research policies of the Member States.
22.
Declaration on Article III-256
The Conference believes that Article III-256 does not affect the right of the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure their energy supply under the conditions provided for in Article III-131.
23.
Declaration on Article III-273(1), second subparagraph
The Conference considers that the European laws referred to in the second subparagraph of Article III-273(1) should take into account national rules and practices relating to the initiation of criminal investigations.
24.
Declaration on Article III-296
The Conference declares that, as soon as the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is signed, the Secretary-General of the Council, High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, the Commission and the Member States should begin preparatory work on the European External Action Service.
25.
Declaration on Article III-325 concerning the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements by Member States relating to the area of freedom, security and justice
The Conference confirms that Member States may negotiate and conclude agreements with third countries or international organisations in the areas covered by Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Chapter IV of Title III of Part III of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe insofar as such agreements comply with Union law.
26.
Declaration on Article III-402(4)
Article III-402(4) of the Constitution provides that where no European law of the Council establishing a new financial framework has been adopted by the end of the previous financial framework, the ceilings and other provisions corresponding to the last year of that framework shall be extended until such time as that law is adopted.
The Conference states that if no European law of the Council establishing a new financial framework has been adopted by the end of 2006 and where the Treaty of Accession of 16 April 2003 provides for a phasing-in period for the allocation of appropriations to the new Member States ending in 2006, the allocation of funds as from 2007 will be established on the basis of the same criteria being applied for all Member States.
27.
Declaration on Article III-419
The Conference declares that Member States may indicate, when they make a request to establish enhanced cooperation, if they intend already at that stage to make use of Article III-422 providing for the extension of qualified majority voting or to have recourse to the ordinary legislative procedure.
28.
Declaration on Article IV-440(7)
The High Contracting Parties agree that the European Council, pursuant to Article IV-440(7), will take a European decision leading to the modification of the status of Mayotte with regard to the Union in order to make this territory an outermost region within the meaning of Article IV-440(2) and Article III-424, when the French authorities notify the European Council and the Commission that the evolution currently underway in the internal status of the island so allows.
29.
Declaration on Article IV-448(2)
The Conference considers that the possibility of producing translations of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe in the languages mentioned in Article IV-448(2) contributes to fulfilling the objective of respecting the Union's rich cultural and linguistic diversity as set forth in the fourth subparagraph of Article I-3(3) of that Treaty.
In this context, the Conference confirms the attachment of the Union to the cultural diversity of Europe and the special attention it will continue to pay to these and other languages.
The Conference recommends that those Member States wishing to avail themselves of the possibility recognised in Article IV-448(2) communicate to the Council, within six months from the date of the signature of that Treaty, the language or languages into which translations of that Treaty will be made.
