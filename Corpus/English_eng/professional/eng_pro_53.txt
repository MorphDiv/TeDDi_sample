Note by the secretariat
At its fifth session, the African Ministers' Council on Water produced a number of outcomes and decisions which have been at the centre of activities undertaken overduring the last eight months.
The activities undertaken have also contributed to the consolidation of the achievements of the Council.
In conformity with existing practices, the implementation of the decisions taken by the Council at its fifth session was carried out in close collaboration with the Council's partners, notably UN Water-Africa (the former Interagency Group for Water in Africa), the African Development Bank, African institutions, civil society organizations and development cooperation partners.
The following report provides a snapshot of activities undertaken between November 2004 and June 2005.
Report of the President on the implementation of the decisions of the Council at its fifth session
The decisions of the Council at its fifth session touch essentially on ten main areas,
(a) Strengthening the governance and institutional arrangements of the Council by adopting rules of procedure for the Council;
(b) Strengthening arrangements for the Council secretariat,
(c) Work programme of the Council;
(d) Trust fund of the Council for financing the work programme;
(e) Operationalizing the African Water Facility by implementing the Group of Eight (G-8) Africa Action Plan water component, notably the transboundary water initiative;
(f) European UnionU Water Initiative for Africa;
(g) Phase II of the Water for African Cities Programme of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat);
(h) Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative;
(i) Council's eEngagement by the Council with with civil society groups;
(j) Contributing to global processes, particularly those linked to the water-related targets of the Millennium Declaration and associated events such as the Fourth World Water Forum and Africa Water Week.
In my letter of March 2005, which in essence was a progress report, I highlighted the efforts made by us all of us in tohe furtherance of the implementation of the decisions made by the Council in Entebbe.
These are set out in the following sectionsincluded:
Work programme 2005-2007
The work programme 2005-2007 work programme was adopted by the Council at its fifth session, held in Entebbe, Uganda, in November 2004.
It outlines the mid-term programme for the CouncilIn response to our request, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) submitted on our behalf a proposal to the European Union Water Facility for financial support to implement the work programme (a copy of the proposal is available).
Trust fund of the Council
At its fifth session, the Council adopted a decision to request UNEP to host a Council trust fund and manage it on behalf of the Council.
The trust fund has now been established with an initial contribution of $100,000 from UNEP.
The President of the Council has written to major development cooperation partners to:
(a) To bBring to their attention the establishment of the trust fund;
(b) To pProvide banking details for contributions to the fund; and
(c) To iInvite partners to make contributions to the fund.
The President has also held a number of bilateral consultations with donor countries, including Denmark and Germany, both of which responded positively.
The necessary follow-up is being undertaken.
African Water Facility
The African Development Bank has successfully undertaken the measures necessary to initiate the operationalization of the African Water Facility.
Those measures include the recruitment of a director and associated staff for the Facility.
The Governing Council of the Facility has also been properly constituted with the designation of representatives by all parties concerned (Council Executive Committee, donor countries, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and UN Water-Africa).
The report of its inaugural meeting, which took place in this building on 28 June 2005, is available and will be introduced by the director of the Facility during the currentis session.
Hosting agreement for the secretariat of the Council
It will be recalled that, at its fifth session, the Council asked the Government of Nigeria to submit within six months a formal request to host the secretariat of the Council in Abuja, Nigeria.
The Government of Nigeria has complied with that request and the request has been circulated at this session (in English and French).
The Council's technical advisory committee has formulated the necessary recommendations for the consideration of the Council.
Rules of procedure for the Council
At its fifth session, the Council formally adopted its rules of procedure.
Governments were requested to formally to confirm their endorsement.
Those rules of procedure will be applied in the governance and operations of the Council.
Communication strategy
A number of steps have been taken by the President to improve communications among the membership of the Council and to maintain effective collaboration with Council partners.
The President initiated the launch of quarterly progress reports in the form of a letter to ministers highlighting the activities and decisions aimed at implementing the outcomes of the fifth session of the Council.
The first of those letters from the President to ministers was distributed in March 2005.
Efforts are also being made to update the Council's directory of members and partners, this being an important tool for keeping in contact with its membership.
Some more work is needed in order to make the directory more comprehensive and up-to-date.
With the assistance of the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and UNEP, terms of reference have been prepared for a consultancy on recommendations for the information technology required to improve the communication systems of the Council.
This work is in progress.
The Council website became operational on 13 June 2005.
The AMCOW Council's corporate profile will be of particular interest to members.
It has now been published and distributed, and provides a snapshot overview of the mandate, structure and activities of the Council.
It will be particularly useful for raising awareness of, and commitment to, the Council.
Report of the Commission for Africa
As all are no doubt aware, the report of the Commission for Africa, which was established by British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, was recently released.
Further information on the work of the Commission is available on the internet (www.commissionforafrica.org).
You will note in the report that paragraphs 65-72, on pages 199-200, refer to subjects expanding on water supply and sanitation in Africa and the role of the Council in coordinating water initiatives in the region.
An extract of this section is included in the working documents for the present meeting.

This was undertaken in close collaboration with members of UN Water-Africa.
A high degree of attention was accorded to regional perspectives and dimensions at the session.
The Council and Africa were once again cited as having evolved strategic approaches, putting in place processes and approaches worthy of emulation by other regions.

The Council's technical advisory committee members have submitted proposals in this regard for our consideration.
Relationship between the Council and the African Union
In conformity with the Constitutive Act of the African Union, relationships between African ministerial bodies and the African Union have become the subject of consultations with a view to establishing the best options for integration of these bodies with the Union.
The Union recently held discussions with the bureau of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN).
The Union will also be holding discussions with the leadership of the Council as a follow-up to our initial contacts.
The Sirte Declaration on the Challenges of Implementing Integrated and Sustainable Development in Agriculture and Water in Africa, included an agreement to request the chair of the African Union Commission to adopt the mandate, structures and activities of the African Minister's Council on Water, AMCEN and the African Ministerial Conference on Agriculture [ck and unify this title: elsewhere it appears as “of”], in order to integrate them into the activities of the Commission of the African Union and its specialized technical committees.
The Council's technical advisory committee has prepared a paper which draws attention to the key issues to be taken into account.
Strengthening coordination with regional economic communities, river and lake basin organizations
The full cooperation of the regional economic communities as well as the river and lake basin organizations in Africa is recognized as crucial.
In order to harness, to the maximum, this huge reservoir of potential, a coordination meeting will be held in this building, tomorrow, 30 June 2005.
The Council's technical advisory committee has made specific recommendations for our consideration.
Outcomes of the ministerial meeting on the Millennium Development Goals

Council ministers were invited to participate in the meeting, which accorded particular attention to the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative launched at the Pan-African Implementation and Partnership Conference on Water and managed by the African Development Bank.
The outcomes of the Paris meeting included the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and other documents.
The African Development Bank will present the main outcomes of the meeting and their implications for the Council to the present meeting.
African Water Week and the Fourth World Water Forum
The African Development Bank organized a water week in Tunis, Tunisia, in June 2004.
At the fifth session of the Council, the Bank proposed that future African Water Weeks be organized under the aegis auspices of the Council.
The Council's technical advisory committee has held deliberations on the matter and has submitted specific recommendations for our consideration.
It has also put forward proposals relating to the Council's contribution to the Fourth World Water Forum.
High-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly to review the five-year implementation of the Millennium Declaration
The Council's contribution to the thirteenth session of the Commission on [NB not “for”check that is right everywhere] for Sustainable Development at its thirteenth session contains sections relevant to the special summit of the General Assembly on the review of the five-year implementation of the Millennium Declaration.
The President of the United Nations General Assembly, in preparation for the above-mentioned meeting to be held in New York from 14 to -16 September 2005, met with Ggovernment delegations in New York on 3  June 2005 and with delegations preparing for the high-level plenary meeting and presented a draft outcome document.
The document was presented following the examination by four working groups of facilitators of different parts of the report of the United Nations Secretary-General entitled “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all”.
The President of the United Nations General Assembly has indicated that he would like to reconvene informal consultations on the document on 21 June 2005.
He expressed the view that the draft outcome document could provide the basis for the outcome of the high-level plenary meeting.
In order to facilitate our discussions on the subject, the Council's technical advisory committee has submitted, for our consideration, specific proposals which might form the basis for the Council's inputs to the discussion on the matter.
The report of the Commission on Africa contains recommendations for the establishment of centres of excellence in Africa on water science and technology.
The importance of establishing centres of excellence in water science and technology was also recognized in the G-8 Africa Action Plan, which envisages international support for improving water resources management in Africa.
The NEPAD science and technology forum, UNEP, the United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (UNESCO) and the French Institute of Research for Development co-sponsored a workshop held at the headquarters of UNEP in Nairobi, 9-12 May 2005, to consider the implications of the Commission's recommendations.
The Council was closely involved in the arrangements for the workshop and chaired the high-level ministerial segment.
Mr. Mukthar Shagari, XX, Federl Minister for Water Resources of Nigeria [Editor's note: what is Mr. Shagari's title?

I have reassigned one of my senior officers to servebe, on a full-time basis, as my special assistant on all matters relating to my duties as President of the Council.
In this connection, I have set up a special unit which is referred to as the Office of the President of the African Ministers' Council on Water, which only handles and processes matters related to the Council.
Council logo
I have taken the liberty of commissioning a new logo for the Council.
Please find attached, for your approval, a large version of the logo intended for the covers of Council brochures and other publications, and a smaller letterhead version, in both English and French.
I believe that the logo will help the Council to establish itself and the recipients of our publications and letters to recognize a proactive corporate Council identity.
I have authorized the use of the logo on an experimental basis pending its formal consideration by the present meeting.
Your approval of the logo design would be greatly appreciated.
