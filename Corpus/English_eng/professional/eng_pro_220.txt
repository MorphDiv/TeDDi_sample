Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Financing of the United Nations Mission in Liberia
Financial performance report for the period from 1 August 2003 to 30 June 2004 and proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 of the United Nations Mission in Liberia
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
Introduction
The recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in paragraph 38 below involves a reduction of $211,500 in the proposed budget of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006.
The Committee also makes several observations and recommendations regarding the administration and management of the Mission and opportunities for further savings.
The general report of the Advisory Committee on United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/59/736) contains its views and recommendations on cross-cutting issues.
In the paragraphs below, the Committee therefore deals with resources and other items specifically relating to UNMIL.
The documents used by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the financing of UNMIL are listed at the end of the present report.
Financial performance report for the period from 1 August 2003 to 30 June 2004
On the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, the General Assembly, by its resolution 58/261 A of 23 December 2003, appropriated to the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Liberia the amount of $564,494,300 for the period from 1 August 2003 to 30 June 2004.
The total amount has been assessed on Member States.
The Advisory Committee notes that the performance report (A/59/624) is the first on UNMIL since the inception of the Mission.
Expenditures for the period from 1 August 2003 to 30 June 2004 totalled $548,278,700 gross ($545,065,600 net), which is $16,315,600 gross ($14,218,700 net) or 2.9 per cent lower than the appropriation of $564,494,300 ($559,284,300 net).
The Committee notes overall savings of $16,315,600 gross for the time period from 1 August 2003 to 30 June 2004.
UNMIL's unutilized balance of $16,315,600 represents a combination of savings and additional requirements under various line items:
(a) UNMIL's savings were attributable to:
(i) Lower-than-budgeted costs for rations and the installation of water purifications units, which made the mission self-sufficient in potable water;
(ii) Higher delayed civilian police deployment rate;
(iii) Delays in the recruitment of international and national staff;
(iv) Hiring of national staff during start-up under special service/individual contractor agreements before converting them into national staff;
(v) Reduced flying hours owing to reduced requirements for aircraft;
(b) UNMIL's budget overruns were attributable to:
(i) Higher-than-estimated acquisition of prefabricated facilities for disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation camps;
(ii) Acquisition of a higher number of generators owing to the unavailability of commercial electrical supply and to the fact that not all contingents brought enough generators for self-sustainment;
(iii) Fuel requirements for generators;
(iv) Faster-than-planned procurement of vehicles and accident-related repairs;
(v) Transport of 80 per cent of contingent-owned equipment by air, whereas the budget had provided for only 20 per cent to be transported by air.
The Advisory Committee points out that some expenditures were erroneously placed against wrong account codes.
For example: travel of staff officers was charged to military observers instead to military contingents; freight costs for formed police units were charged to military contingents; and fuel for generators was incorrectly charged to petrol, oil and lubricants under ground transportation instead of to facilities and infrastructure.
The Committee was informed that these inconsistencies occurred during mission start-up.
The Committee notes with satisfaction that these errors have been addressed in the narrative and points out that peacekeeping missions, especially during the difficult start-phase, rely on their counterparts at New York Headquarters to verify the integrity of information before presenting it to Member States.
The Advisory Committee expects that submitted financial information will be accurate and that errors will be corrected prior to submission, particularly in view of the fact that budget cycle dates are fixed and the related work should be planned well in advance.
The Committee also addresses this matter in its general report (A/59/736).
The Advisory Committee notes with appreciation that, overall, the performance report was detailed and precise.
It included quantifiable explanations of achievements and explained shortcomings in a frank and objective manner.
Further improvement could be made in qualifying some benchmarks.
For instance, the Committee was informed that the term “zero violations” did not necessarily signify no violations at all.
“Zero violations” would need to be interpreted as the absence of violations that are sufficiently serious to be considered destabilizing and would therefore, in a results-based budgeting context, have an impact on UNMIL's attainment of expected accomplishments.
Moreover, the term advice was used without further explanation as to its exact scope and nature; it would be useful to avoid using generic terms but rather to briefly explain the nature of such advice.
In conjunction with similar recommendations in section IV below, the Advisory Committee trusts that future results-based budgeting texts will include transparent and succinct terminology as a matter of routine.
The comments of the Advisory Committee on the information in the performance report on individual expenditure objects can be found in the discussion of the proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 in the paragraphs below.
Information on performance for the current financial period
This year, owing to various constraints, rather than including standard statistical data on performance for the current period in each of the individual peacekeeping reports, it has been necessary to supply this information in consolidated tables, which are annexed to the Advisory Committee's general report on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736).
The information to be provided covers the following: (a) expenditure for the current period; (b) current incumbency; (c) status of reimbursement for troop/formed police costs, contingent-owned equipment and death and disability; (d) cash position of the missions; and (e) status of contributions.
The Advisory Committee notes that during budget periods 2003/04 and 2004/05, financial provisions were made in support of the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation programme.
Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that, during the 2003/04 budget period, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) had billed UNMIL an amount approximately $481,000, including costs for the rental of premises, construction services, fuel and the acquisition of equipment related to the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation programme.
In its latest report on UNMIL, the Committee referred to its earlier recommendation that disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation-related activities be more clearly defined (A/58/591, para.
The Committee was informed that the disarmament and demobilization portion had been completed in November 2004 and that the focus was now on the reintegration and rehabilitation side of the programme.
In the sixth progress report of the Secretary-General (see S/2005/177, part VI), it was indicated that, as at 1 March 2005, the total number of formally disarmed combatants was 101,495, including 22,370 women, 8,523 boys and 2,440 girls.
Ninety-eight per cent of former child combatants have rejoined their families with the assistance of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
The final figures of collected weapons and ammunition were 28,314 weapons, 33,604 pieces of heavy munitions and 6,486,136 rounds of small arms ammunition.
UNMIL has destroyed all weapons and ammunition collected during the disarmament process and has received and destroyed an additional 252 assorted weapons and 3,513 pieces of ammunition since the formal closure of the disarmament and demobilization exercise in November 2004.
The Secretary-General, in his report, highlights a current donor funding shortfall for reintegration and rehabilitation in the amount of $40 million, which is urgently needed for reintegration projects for ex-combatants.
The Advisory Committee was informed that one donation, denominated in euros and totalling approximately $3.7 million, had been firmly pledged while other donations were being finalized.
UNMIL is hopeful that, once these pledges are finalized, the funding shortfall will be narrowed to approximately $10 million.
The Committee's discussion of certain considerations regarding the activities of the humanitarian pillar in this regard is contained in its general report on peacekeeping operations (A/59/736).
The Advisory Committee notes with satisfaction that significant progress has been made in finalizing memorandums of understanding; as at 31 March 2005, 43 memorandums of understanding have been signed while eight are in draft form, awaiting finalization.
Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006
Mandate and planned results
General
The Advisory Committee notes with satisfaction that, in general, UNMIL's budget presentation took into account observations made in the Committee's earlier report (A/58/798, para.
10) and that quantitative and qualitative performance indicators were used to measure achieved and planned outputs.
The Committee trusts that the Mission's efforts in this respect will continue and that its results-based budgeting presentation will be further refined.
The Advisory Committee expresses concern about information presented in footnote c/ to the human resources table in the proposed budget (A/59/630, Summary).
The footnote refers to a proposed increase in the number of civilian police officers to 875 and a reduction of officers in formed police units to 240 in 2005/06; while the table itself shows a formed police unit strength of 480.
The table gives the impression that UNMIL has a new authorized strength at 1,355 police officers (875 civilian police and 480 formed police unit officers).
Only by referring to the footnote does it become apparent that UNMIL's authorized strength remains unchanged at 1,115 police officers.
In future presentations, this ambiguity should be avoided.
The Committee urges that all relevant information be integrated into tables and that explanations be kept simple and straightforward.
In this respect, the Advisory Committee notes that some information in the proposed budget was drafted in a less than transparent manner, for example, the proposed addition of four P-3 posts for the office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/630, table 3).
The proposal to establish two of these posts was noted in the text; however, the proposal to establish two more P-3 posts could be interpreted only after some effort and by “reading between the lines”.
Also, on several occasions the text merely indicates that a post is “needed” without further explanation as to whether this post should be newly established, reclassified or redeployed.
The Committee trusts that the text in future budget proposals is written so as to avoid possible misinterpretation.
In its latest report on UNMIL (A/58/798, para.
14), the Advisory Committee requested the Mission to provide more information on collaboration and coordination with other United Nations-system partners.
The Committee notes with appreciation the informative briefings and useful responses provided by substantive and administrative officials of the Mission.
However, as noted below, the presence of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General or the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Humanitarian Coordination, Rehabilitation, Recovery and Reconstruction) in order to share their vision of UNMIL's present and future operations, as well as the Mission's exit strategy would have been helpful.
The Advisory Committee was informed that, overall, cooperation with the various segments of the country team is progressing satisfactorily and that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Humanitarian Coordination, Rehabilitation, Recovery and Reconstruction) ensures regular contact with partners, including UNDP, UNICEF and the United Nations Office for Project Services.
Nonetheless, the Committee believes that more could be done to conduct cooperation and collaboration with a view to an optimal and measurable use of resources.
The Committee notes in paragraph 10 of its report on the financing of the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) (A/59/768) that a work plan for 2005, containing an integrated list of priorities, has been developed and approved by United Nations agencies, funds and programmes in the Sudan.
The Committee encourages UNMIL to pursue the preparation of a similar work plan, perhaps using the work plan of UNMIS as a reference, in conjunction with its already existing integrated mandate implementation plan, and looks forward to follow-up during the 2006/07 budget presentation.
Resource requirements
General
The Advisory Committee notes that UNMIL's proposed 2005/06 budget, excluding voluntary contributions, totals $711,382,900 (net) or $100,518,200 (12.4 per cent) less than the appropriation for 2004/05 of $811,901,100.
Military and civilian police personnel
Cost estimates for military observers for the period 2005/06 total $11,711,500 which is an increase of $265,700 over the 2004/05 apportionment of $11,445,800.
The proposed increase is a combination of: (a) higher travel costs, for example $3,200/one-way as compared to $2,500/one-way in the previous budget period; and (b) lower rations expenses due to provisions limited to reserve water only, not for reserve rations, which will be replaced from the existing standard ration provision.
UNMIL's troop strength remains unchanged at 14,785.
Cost estimates for military contingents for 2005/06 total $312,042,200, which is a decrease of $43,696,600 from the previous budget period apportionment of $355,738,800.
Supplementary information submitted indicates that the main factors for the proposed decrease results from: (a) the repatriation of three infantry battalions (2,348 troops) during March 2006; and (b) the discontinuance of mission subsistence allowance payments to staff officers, except to four sector commanders, since the Mission will now provide accommodation and food.
As at 1 March 2005, UNMIL reported a strength of 128 military staff officers.
The Committee points out that in its previous report on UNMIL (A/58/798, para.
18), it was informed by the Secretariat that hard-walled accommodations for staff officers would be available as at July/August 2004.
The Committee regrets the delay in completing these accommodations and the related payment of mission subsistence allowance for an extended period, but is cognizant of the demands placed on the Mission's integrated support services during start-up operations and in relation to the construction of camps for ex-combatants.
In his sixth progress report on UNMIL, the Secretary-General proposed that the Security Council authorize an additional 120 civilian police personnel for six months, commencing in August 2005, for the temporary deployment of a fifth formed police unit (S/2005/177, para.
The Advisory Committee stands ready to consider any additional budgetary requirements that may arise in this respect.
Civilian personnel
Information on UNMIL's proposed new and abolished posts, as well as on planned redeployments and reclassifications was provided to the Advisory Committee by the Secretariat and is summarized here as follows:
a FS: Field service; GS (OL): General Service, Other level; NO: National officer; LL: Local level; UNV: United Nations Volunteers.
b Denotes staff redeployed or reclassified from an office or to an office at UNMIL.
Redeployments/reclassifications are not necessarily an “even exchange” among offices; as a result, numbers at individual levels vary while only the net total is the same.
The net number of international staff remains unchanged at 635, calculated as follows:
An increase of 11 national staff posts from 798 to 809 is proposed, calculated as follows:
The Advisory Committee was informed that, following the closure of the office of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Liberia, which was staffed with 32 professional and 14 administrative personnel, UNMIL recruited 11 former national staff and two former international staff of that office.
As at the end of November 2004, the coordination of humanitarian-related functions within Liberia was assumed by the office of the Deputy Special Representative for the Secretary-General (Humanitarian Coordination, Rehabilitation, Recovery and Reconstruction).
UNMIL is now tasked with the coordination of the efforts of UNDP, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and various non-governmental organizations; UNMIL will organize bi-monthly meetings to facilitate the coordination process.
To augment its humanitarian coordination functions, UNMIL proposed the establishment of four P-3 posts and the reclassification and/or redeployment of one P-5 post of Chief of Section, two P-4 posts of Humanitarian Affairs Officers and one General Service (Other level) post with humanitarian coordination, rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction.
In this context, the Committee would have welcomed an exchange with the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, in particular with regard to the Mission's envisioned hand-over and exit strategy relating to its humanitarian tasks.
Given the continued need for humanitarian coordination activities, the Committee expresses concern at the sudden departure of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the absorption of these functions by UNMIL.
The Committee trusts that UNMIL will develop a long-term perspective on how functions currently within the scope of humanitarian coordination, rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction activities may be transformed and eventually phased out; the Committee anticipates an update in this respect during the 2006/07 budget presentation.
The Committee comments on the collaboration of missions and their United Nations-system partners in the humanitarian and development pillars of integrated missions in its general report (A/59/736).
Recommendations on posts
Establishment of one P-5 post for a Personnel Conduct Officer in the immediate office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/630, table 1 and para.
The Advisory Committee was informed that UNMIL has a vigorous oversight policy in place to prevent and identify misconduct.
The Committee was informed that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has instructed all missions to include personnel conduct functions in their budget proposals, but that this instruction was issued without the support of a larger review or policy framework, which is now being formulated.
The Committee points out that personnel conduct functions are not new and are not necessarily separate functions, but are an integral part of the functions of human resources, as well as military and civilian chief of staff functions.
In fact, guidelines have routinely been issued for civilian police, military observers and contingents all of which operate under their respective civilian police and military chains of command.
The Committee regrets that the approach of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to personnel conduct matters within a Mission's administrative structures has been reactive rather than preventative.
In view of the current efforts of the Department to formulate a strategic approach on personnel conduct functions, the Committee does not object to the establishment of a P-5 Personnel Conduct Officer post at UNMIL.
The Committee comments further on this matter in its general report.
(a) Establishment of two P-3 Programme Officers for programme planning and assessment functions, office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (A/59/630, table 3).
The budget proposal indicates that these two functions are required to provide expanded programme planning and assessment functions the UNMIL's substantive sections.
The two P-3 posts will also provide advice and support for the results-focused transition framework;
(b) Establishment of two P-3 Programme Officers for the Relief, Recovery and Rehabilitation section of the office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Humanitarian Coordination, Rehabilitation, Recovery and Reconstruction) (A/59/630, table 3).
The proposal for two P-3 posts results from the decision to add a total of five P-3 Humanitarian Area Coordinators for the Humanitarian Coordination Section; this would be partially offset by the transfer and reclassification downward of two posts from P-4 to P-3;
(c) Pending the development of the long-term perspective referred to in paragraph 24 above and related action by the General Assembly, the Advisory Committee is recommending the provision of general temporary assistance to cover the above functions.
Abolition of one D-1 Deputy Director post in the Electoral Division (A/59/630, table 5).
The abolition of the D-1 post is proposed following a March 2004 review by the Department of Political Affairs.
The D-2 post in the Division will remain.
The Advisory Committee notes that after the October 2005 elections, and as at 31 December 2005, the Division will become a section with eight staff, to be headed by one P-5.
The Advisory Committee has no objection to the abolition of the D-1 post.
Establishment of five Humanitarian Affairs Officers (national officers), Humanitarian Coordination Section (A/59/630, table 3).
Although the Advisory Committee in general supports the establishment of national officer posts, for the reasons given in paragraph 26 above, the Committee recommends the provision of general temporary assistance.
Reclassification of four international General Service posts to national posts, and establishment of two additional national posts at the Electoral Division (A/59/630, table 5).
The Advisory Committee supports the conversion of four international General Service posts into national staff posts and the establishment of two new national posts, which would be consistent with its recommendations to utilize national staff whenever operationally possible and practical.
The budget document contains a number of proposed reclassifications and redeployments, listed in the paragraphs below by organizational component.
The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the following proposals for the reasons given in the report of the Secretary-General.
As with all posts, they should be subject to periodic review on the basis of operational needs.
Immediate office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General:
(a) International staff: redeployment of one General Service (Other level) post from component 1; transfer of the Integrated Mission Staff Development and Training Centre, along with its P-4 post, to the office of the Chief of Administrative Services;
(b) National staff: transfer of eight national staff posts to the office of the Chief of Administrative Services; and redeployment of one national General Service post to component 1;
(c) United Nations Volunteers: transfer of seven United Nations Volunteers positions to the office of the Chief of Administrative Services; and redeployment of two United Nations Volunteers positions to component 2.
Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Humanitarian Coordination, Rehabilitation, Recovery and Reconstruction), component 1, ceasefire (A/59/630, table 2):
(a) International staff: abolition of the Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration and Rehabilitation Section and transfer of three P-4 posts to component 2; redeployment of one General Service post to the office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General; and redeployment of one P-5 post and two P-3 posts to component 2;
(b) National staff: redeployment of one national officer post to component 2;
(c) United Nations Volunteers: redeployment of four United Nations Volunteers positions to component 2.
Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Humanitarian Coordination, Rehabilitation, Recovery and Reconstruction), component 2, humanitarian and human rights (A/59/630, table 3).
The proposals in this component are driven by the closure of the OCHA office in Liberia.
(a) International staff: following the closure of the office of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, its functions were integrated into the Humanitarian Coordination Section, some of whose functions are proposed to be changed as follows: reclassification from P-4 to P-3 of three Recovery and Rehabilitation posts and their redeployment to the Relief, Recovery and Rehabilitation Section; redeployment of two P-4 Humanitarian Affairs Officers posts to the Humanitarian Coordination Section; transfer of one General Service Administrative Assistant to the office of the Special Representative;
(b) National staff: redeployment of one Report Officer (national); and the redeployment of six Administrative Assistant posts (national General Service) to the Humanitarian Coordination Section;
(c) United Nations Volunteers: redeployment of two positions from the office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and four positions from component 1; and redeployment of three positions to component 4.
Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Operations and Rule of Law, component 3, security reform (A/59/630, table 4).
There are no proposed staffing changes for component 3.
Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Operations and Rule of Law, component 4, peace process (A/59/630, table 5).
(a) International staff/Electoral Division: redeployment of one P-3 post to component 2; reclassification of two P-3 posts to P-4 and one P-3 post to P-2; reclassification of three P-3 County Electoral Officer posts to two P-4 Operations Advisers and one P-2 Training Coordinator; redeployment of one P-3 post to component 2.
The Composition of the Electoral Division was reviewed and the revision of 20 functions, ranging from the Field Service level to P-5, is proposed.
Redeployment of posts from the closed liaison office of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) into the Political Planning and Policy Unit, namely one P-5 and one General Service post;
(b) National staff: redeployment of one post from the office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General; conversion of one national post in the Electoral Division to national General Service; redeployment of one national staff post from the closed ECOWAS liaison office to the Political Planning and Policy Unit;
(c) United Nations Volunteers: redeployment to the Electoral Division from component 2 of three United Nations Volunteers positions.
Following the elections scheduled for October 2005, 197 posts in the Electoral Division will be abolished by 31 December 2005.
The Division will be renamed the Electoral Unit and maintained until 30 June 2006 with eight remaining posts: one P-5 post for a Management Administration Adviser; three P-4 posts (Civic/Voter Education Adviser, Electoral Legal Adviser and Operations Adviser); one P-3 post for a Field Coordination Adviser; one Administrative Assistant (international General Service); and two Drivers/Clerks (national General Service).
The proposed budget implies that the existing D-2 post in the Electoral Division will, along with the other 197 posts, also be abolished as at 31 December 2005.
The main role of the Electoral Unit will be to support the National Electoral Commission in the organization of local elections.
Division of Administration, component 5, support (A/59/630, table 6):
(a) International staff: redeployment of one P-4 post from the Integrated Mission Staff Development and Training Centre, office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, to the office of the Chief of Administrative Services; the Contracts Management Unit will be abolished and its two P-3 posts will be redeployed to the Joint Logistics Operations Centre;
(b) National staff: redeployment of eight national posts from the Integrated Mission Staff Development and Training Centre to the office of the Chief of Administrative Services;
(c) United Nations Volunteers: redeployment of seven United Nations Volunteers positions from the Integrated Mission Staff Development and Training Centre to the office of the Chief of Administrative Services; and the redeployment of one United Nations Volunteers position from the abolished Contracts Management Unit to the Joint Logistics Operations Centre.
Other recommendations and observations
The Advisory Committee notes the presence of two Director-level posts in the Relief, Recovery and Rehabilitation Section reporting to the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (HCRRR).
The Committee is not convinced of the added value to relief, recovery and rehabilitation operations of maintaining two director-level posts in a section that is comprised of only 22 staff, including one D-2; one D-1; two P-5 and eight P-3/2 posts, in addition to 10 General Service, United Nations Volunteer and national staff.
The Committee requests that UNMIL review its structure and look into the possibility of abolishing one director-level post.
Pending this review, the Committee recommends a reduction equivalent to one D-1 post.
The Advisory Committee was informed during the hearings that owing to the need for expeditious placement, national staff were recruited initially as individual contractors.
Contractors who successfully passed through all required clearance were subsequently placed against established national staff posts.
Upon enquiry, UNMIL informed the Committee that prior to 1 April 2004, individual contractors were hired in a competitive process utilizing interview panels.
The Committee was also informed that 208 individuals were employed by UNMIL under special service/individual contractor agreements and that four were being charged against authorized posts, pending conversion to regular contracts.
The Committee expresses serious concern at this practice and provides extensive comments in its general report (A/59/736).
It trusts that the expedient use during the very initial stage of the operation has by now been discontinued.
Functions of a continuing nature should be carried out by staff occupying established posts and the related expenditures should be charged to staff costs.
Every effort should be made to regularize the situation at UNMIL as a matter of urgency.
The Advisory Committee notes that UNMIL undertook a preliminary structural review during 2003/04.
While the Committee is cognizant of the fact that UNMIL may present plans for liquidation for inclusion in the 2006/07 budget proposal, it nonetheless recommends a comprehensive review of the Mission's administrative and support components in order to identify opportunities for savings and streamlining Mission operations now that UNMIL has concluded start-up and is in its maintenance phase.
Operational costs
The Committee notes a decreased proposed budget for operational requirements, namely a reduction by $53,317,500 from 2004/05 to 2005/06.
Travel
The Advisory Committee notes that proposed travel plans for the period 2005/06 have, overall, been consolidated with fewer trips now that UNMIL has matured from its start-up to its maintenance phase.
The Committee is cognizant of the fact that UNMIL is undertaking efforts to reduce its travel requirements and that it is increasingly using video conferences for effective and efficient communication between the Mission and Headquarters.
Ground transportation
The Advisory Committee was informed that UNMIL intends to utilize written-off vehicles from the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) in support of the upcoming elections.
The Committee commends both Missions for their cooperation in this respect.
Information provided indicates that UNMIL currently has a total of 44 vehicles on loan to United Nations agencies and other missions.
However, upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that 37 of the 38 vehicles on loan to the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) had already been returned by October 2004 and that one will be written off due to accident damage.
The Committee was informed that while the budget document was being prepared it was not foreseen that these vehicles would be returned before the new budget period.
The Committee notes that, at the time of budget submission, several months had already passed during which the submitted information could easily have been corrected.
The Committee was also informed that five vehicles were on loan to UNDP and one vehicle to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); a reimbursable arrangement is in place in this respect.
In addition, UNMIL currently holds 73 vehicles as mission reserve.
The Committee was informed that there is no specific policy in place in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to determine the ratio of reserve vehicles.
The Committee expects savings as the result of the timely return of vehicles loaned to UNOCI.
Moreover, the vehicle replacement plan does not fully reflect the planned reduction of Mission personnel.
Following the elections in October 2005 and the subsequent drawdown of staff, the Committee expects a commensurate reduction of vehicles in all categories.
The Committee recommends that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations develop a policy on reserve vehicle holdings.
Air transport
The Advisory Committee notes that, during the budget period 2003/04, UNMIL did not utilize all of its approved helicopters: of 8 approved Mi-24 helicopters, 6 were in-Mission; and of 4 approved Mi-26 transport helicopters, 2 were sufficient for Mission operations.
During 2004/05, 3 Mi-26 transport helicopters were approved.
The Committee notes with satisfaction that, while UNMIL is currently using two Mi-26 helicopters, one of them will be phased out effective 1 March 2006.
The remaining helicopter's flying hours will be increased.
The resulting savings from a reduction of the rotary wing aircraft fleet will be considerable, amounting to $7,475,250.
The Committee trusts that UNMIL will continue to monitor its air transport requirements and continue its proactive approach in making appropriate savings for maximum operational efficiency.
Medical
The proposed 2005/06 budget for this object of expenditure amounts to $13,995,700.
This amount is $1,035,300 lower than the 2004/05 budget appropriation of $15,031,000.
The Advisory Committee notes with concern that, overall, the danger of contagious diseases, including haemorrhagic fevers, such as lassa fever, cerebral malaria, and typhoid, remains a matter of concern at UNMIL.
The Committee was informed that 32 deaths have occurred since the inception of the Mission, including 3 deaths from lassa fever, 2 deaths from cerebral malaria and 19 cases of serious psychological stress disorders, including suicides.
Upon enquiry regarding overall staff morale at UNMIL, the Committee was informed that morale was not easy to quantify and that conditions at the Mission were difficult.
The Committee is concerned by this vague response, which may indicate that staff morale at UNMIL might be low.
The Committee was also informed that the number of staff leaving UNMIL had increased and that it was unclear whether this was due to overall mission management or to general mission conditions.
The Committee believes that the physical and psychological well-being of the staff is paramount and recommends that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ascertain, perhaps in conjunction with other appropriate offices, how UNMIL management can best address any staff morale problems in a preventative manner.
In this respect, the Committee refers to its remarks on the establishment of a Personnel Conduct Officer post in paragraph 25 above, and stresses the necessity of urgent remedial action.
The Committee expects that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, in collaboration with UNMIL, will develop appropriate preventative administrative measures.
