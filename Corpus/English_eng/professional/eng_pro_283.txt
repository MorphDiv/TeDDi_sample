Programme planning
Proposed biennial programme plan and priorities for the period 2006-2007
Programme 27 Safety and security
Note by the Secretary-General*
In its resolution 59/275 of 23 December 2004, the General Assembly adopted the biennial programme plan and priorities for the period 2006-2007.
It is recalled that the General Assembly, in its resolution 58/269 of 23 December 2003, requested the Committee for Programme and Coordination, in performing its programmatic role in the planning and budgeting process, to review the programmatic aspects of new and/or revised mandates subsequent to the adoption of the biennial programme plan, as well as any differences that arose between the biennial programme plan and the programmatic aspects of the proposed programme budget.
The only new mandate affecting the programme narratives of the approved biennial programme plan and priorities for the period 2006-2007 relates to safety and security.
The General Assembly, in section XI of its resolution 59/276 of 23 December 2004, decided to establish the Department of Safety and Security to implement activities related to the question of safety and security that had been reflected in the biennial programme plan for the period 2006-2007 under programme 24, Management and support services, and programme 26, Jointly financed activities.
A consolidated and revised programme plan for the new programme 27, Safety and security, has been prepared for review by the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the General Assembly (see annex).
The proposed new programme 27 would replace component (a), Security and safety services of subprogramme 4, Support services, for Headquarters and the United Nations Offices at Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi, of programme 24; and section D, Inter-organizational security measures, of programme 26.
The programme narrative (objectives of the Organization, expected accomplishments of the Secretariat and indicators of achievement) for safety and security in the biennial programme plan has been modified to take into account the consolidation of all of the safety and security activities under the responsibility of the Department of Safety and Security.
The approved new programme will be issued as document A/59/6/Rev.1/Add.1.
The programme narrative of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 for safety and security activities (A/60/6 (Sect.
33)) is identical to that of the consolidated programme 27 attached hereto.
It is understood that any subsequent modifications to the programme narrative of programme 27 will be taken into account by the General Assembly at its sixtieth session when it reviews the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 under section 33, Safety and security.

Overall orientation
27.1 For the first half-century of its existence, the United Nations felt protected by its flag and the perception that it was a neutral, benevolent actor in world events.
Beginning in the early 1990s, there was a rise in the number of deaths and injuries of staff members as a result of malicious acts.
The majority of those incidents occurred because the staff member was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
When United Nations personnel were directly targeted, it was generally viewed as an isolated event.
27.2 In recent years the security environment for the United Nations has changed and become more threatening.
In addition, the mandates of the United Nations have evolved, resulting in a larger number of United Nations staff members, notably from the humanitarian agencies, being deployed on potentially hazardous missions.
At the same time, peacekeeping missions have been established in areas of war or in situations of high risk.
Increasingly, humanitarian staff are being deployed alongside military units in integrated multidisciplinary missions.
27.3 The primary responsibility, under the Charter of the United Nations, for the security and protection of personnel of the United Nations system lies with the Member States.
However, there are situations under which Governments do not provide security coverage, particularly during emergency situations, such as abrupt changes in government, civil disorder and the absence of de facto authorities.
In order to enhance the safety and security of personnel of the organizations of the United Nations system in such situations and to prepare for any eventuality, the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator was created in 1988 to enable the United Nations to effectively and efficiently carry out its activities in a safe and secure working environment.
Over the years, the United Nations Security Coordinator coordinated and monitored the planning and implementation of inter-agency security and safety programmes, including all training.
27.4 Following the report of the Independent Panel on the Safety and Security of United Nations Personnel in Iraq on its investigation of the Baghdad attack in August 2003, a concerted effort has been made across the United Nations system to improve and strengthen security arrangements.
The General Assembly, in its resolution 59/276 of 23 December 2004, decided to establish the Department of Safety and Security, emphasizing the need for an enhanced culture of security awareness on the part of all staff and compliance with safety and security rules and procedures throughout the United Nations system, as well as clear lines of authority and accountability.
27.5 The overall goals of this programme are:
(a) To support and facilitate the effective conduct of United Nations activities by ensuring a coherent, effective and timely response to all security-related threats and other emergencies;
(b) To ensure effective risk mitigation through the establishment of a coordinated security threat and risk assessment mechanism within the framework of a common system-wide methodology;
(c) To develop high-quality best-practice security policies, standards and operational procedures across the United Nations system, including the appropriate degree of standardization;
(d) To support implementation and monitor compliance with those security policies, standards and operational procedures;
(e) To ensure the most cost-effective provision and employment of security personnel by taking advantage of economies of scale and through centrally directed recruitment, selection, training, deployment and career development.
27.6 The work of the Department will be implemented under three subprogrammes: security and safety coordination, regional field operation coordination and field support.
For the period 2006-2007, the Department will focus on enhancing coordination of the United Nations security management system; improving the implementation of policies and procedures relating to the security and safety of United Nations personnel and their eligible dependants; and consolidating, harmonizing and promulgating common policies, standards and operational procedures.
The Department will also coordinate the activities of the United Nations system security and safety management network.
A key element in all these measures will be the enhancement of the professional standards of safety and security personnel through the provision of training services in basic security functions, as well as in various specialized areas of safety and security.
Specific measures will be undertaken to develop supplemental capacity in the Department, beyond the available standing capacity, to facilitate rapid response to security incidents and emergencies and to emergency situations that could affect the viability of United Nations operations.
Subprogramme 1
Security and safety coordination
a Text approved in A/59/6/Rev.1, programme 24.
Strategy
27.7 This subprogramme is the responsibility of the Division of Safety and Security Services.
The strategy for ensuring a secure and safe environment will include increasing the level of preparedness for managing crisis situations.
The standards of professionalism of the security and safety personnel will be further enhanced through the provision of specialized training to the officers on a continuous basis, which will also maximize the use of officers for multiple specialized security functions.
The skills of officers will be increased to keep them abreast of security and safety technology and modernized/upgraded communication equipment to ensure more efficient evacuation response and crisis management capabilities, reduced emergency response time, improved surveillance detection and more effective safety inspections, personal protection and other critical security functions.
Furthermore, security awareness training for delegations and staff at large will be enhanced.
The inspection of all physical structures related to security and safety will continue to be given high priority.
Subprogramme 2
Regional field operation coordination
Strategy
27.8 This subprogramme is the responsibility of the Division of Regional Operations.
The strategy for implementing the subprogramme will focus on creating conditions to minimize security-related incidents by: (a) coordinating safety and security issues between the organizations of the United Nations system; (b) monitoring the implementation of established security and safety policies; (c) developing security requirements for new missions as well as for special, regular and emergency operations; (d) monitoring, through compliance, assessment, survey and inspection missions, the implementation of the minimum operating security standards at field duty stations; (e) updating guidelines and directives; and (f) coordinating with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Political Affairs and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on the planning, implementation and review of safety and security programmes for peacekeeping, humanitarian and other special missions in the field.
Those efforts will enforce the accountability and responsibility of designated officials, field security officers and other actors within the framework of the new mechanism of accountability and responsibility in the area of field security for the implementation of the minimum operating security standards at all duty stations of the United Nations system.
Priority attention will also be given to developing contingency plans for quick response to security incidents and emergencies that are beyond the capacity of in-country security arrangements.
Subprogramme 3
Field support
a Text approved in A/59/6/Rev.1, programme 26.
Strategy
27.9 This subprogramme is the responsibility of the Field Support Service.
The implementation strategy will include the translation of security training standards into a coherent training programme for all actors in the United Nations security management system.
Regional workshops and seminars will be conducted on security and safety issues, including on stress management.
Related training materials will be developed and updated, taking into account gender-specific material.
Counselling services will also be provided to staff as needed.
