We need to start by finding similarities in training and curricula.
In the long run, uniform training courses and uniform curricula would be a great help and we must work towards that.
Until then, the Member States must consider very carefully how and where additional demands and improvements are needed and what sort of subsequent examination then needs to be demanded.
The deadline provided for by the Commission - which says that a decision on recognition must be made within three months - is an excellent move.
Procedures for recognising diplomas acquired in third countries must also be simplified.
We must cut the red tape within the EU, so that our citizens are able to put their skills to good use in every Member State.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening I should simply like to welcome the initiative aimed at simplifying and clarifying the directives relating to the recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications.
I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Weiland, and point out that I agree with what Evelyne Gebhardt said before me.
As an MEP from a border region I am frequently questioned by students that have come up against a system that was implemented in 1989 and 1992, and I am not exaggerating when I say that urgent changes are needed as current mechanisms are far from transparent.
Too many students come up against brick walls in their attempt to have their qualifications validated by the authorities in the various Member States.
All too often they are unjustly denied recognition, which places them in an intolerable position.
As far as principles are concerned, this is a violation of the right to the freedom of movement and, from a more human point of view, it creates an often devastating situation for students who have sought to better their qualifications but then cannot find a relevant job at the end of it.
The cost of the validation process also warrants discussion.
I am personally therefore very pleased to see that measures are finally being taken to apply the principles of free movement in practical terms.
More specifically, the proposal for a directive contains some interesting provisions with regard to clarification.
It provides that the host Member State must take account of all of the experience a person has gained since completing the qualification and can no longer demand countervailing measures.
We clearly could have taken things a stage further, as will undoubtedly be inevitable for other jobs, and I hope that progress can be achieved with the assistance of a Council that is far less cautious in future.
We shall no doubt discuss this issue again, but I hope that this evening' s debate will be welcomed as a step forward in the issue.
Mr President, may I start by thanking the members of your House for the interest they have shown in the proposal and for the work carried out by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and Mr Wieland, in particular?
A number of amendments proposed by Parliament aim to further improve the text of the Council' s common position by illuminating certain points that could otherwise be open to different interpretations.
This is the case for Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6 and 11, amendments which the Commission welcomes.
Moreover, the Commission has taken note of the requests made in Amendments Nos 1 and 2 to codify the directive on "recognition of professional qualifications" and to re-examine the problem of recognition of formal qualifications acquired in third countries.
In principle, the Commission does not object to these requests, but I would remind you once again that these requests do not belong in the preamble to the directive, especially since they are completely unrelated to the content of the directive.
Their approval would contravene the rules governing technical legislation and the interinstitutional agreement that exists in this context.
Regarding medical training, which forms the subject of Amendments Nos 3 and 7 to 10, the Commission shares Parliament' s view that on the one hand, this is a matter of great importance which requires further attention but on the other hand, these amendments only contain a few isolated proposals which require a more general analysis before they can be examined and approved.
Community legislation cannot be altered without a truly global analysis of the role of the GP, the role of the specialist doctor and the respective significance of basic training, specialist training and continuing training.
This is why the Commission believes that it is far too early to adopt Amendments Nos 3 and 7 to 10.
Moreover, it is said that these amendments will considerably delay the final adoption of the proposal, which would not just be terribly unfortunate, it would also be out of all proportion to the many benefits which we stand to gain from this draft directive.
Amendments Nos 12 and 13 are, in fact, not new.
They contain the amendment already adopted at first reading, which was intended to regulate the situation of certain architects from Ireland.
The Council and Commission have already explained why this amendment cannot be adopted, namely because this issue is a purely internal affair.
This concludes my response.
I thank you for the opportunity you have given me to expand on this matter.
Commissioner, allow me to thank you for being both brief and to the point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
