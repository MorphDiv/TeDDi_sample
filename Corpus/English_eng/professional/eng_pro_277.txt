Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 123
Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of
the United Nations peacekeeping operations
Feasibility of consolidating the accounts of the various
peacekeeping operations
Note by the Secretary-General
The present note is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 57/319, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to provide a comprehensive report on the feasibility of consolidating the accounts of the various peacekeeping operations, including a simulation of the proposed options.
The Secretary-General regrets that, owing to the unprecedented surge in peacekeeping operations, the Secretariat has not been in a position to dedicate the necessary resources to the preparation of the report.
In addition, further analysis is required to consider the efficiency aspects of streamlining the processes for the financing of peacekeeping operations and at the same time permitting more consistent and timely reimbursement to troop-contributing Governments, in the context of the Secretary-General's proposals on reform.
The Secretary-General intends to submit the report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.
