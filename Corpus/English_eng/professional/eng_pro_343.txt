Fifty-ninth session
Agenda item 56 (n)
Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations: cooperation between the United Nations
and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
Letter dated 2 September 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Slovenia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly
I have the honour to address myself to you in connection with item 56 (n) of the agenda of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly.
After intense consultations among the member States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, no agreement was reached on the text of a draft resolution.
I would therefore like to request, on behalf of the member States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that consideration of the sub-item “Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe” be postponed to the sixtieth session of the General Assembly and that it be included in the draft agenda of that session.
Without setting a precedent, this request is made on the clear understanding among member States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that this sub-item will again fall under the item entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations”, which is to be included in the agenda of the sixty-first session and which will be considered biennially, pursuant to Assembly resolution 55/285 of 7 September 2001.
(Signed) Roman Kirn Ambassador Permanent Representative of the Republic of Slovenia to the United Nations
