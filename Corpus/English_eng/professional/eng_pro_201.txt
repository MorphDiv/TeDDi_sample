Introduction
The number of active peacekeeping operations during the reporting period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 was 16 (including UNTSO and UNMOGIP, which are funded by the regular budget).
During the same period, four new multidimensional operations were authorized by the Security Council (UNMIL (October 2003), UNOCI (April 2004), MINUSTAH (June 2004) and ONUB (June 2004)) and two missions were extended (UNAMSIL (September 2004) and UNMISET (November 2004)).
This expansion was marginally offset by the closure of UNIKOM (October 2003).
The unprecedented surge in peacekeeping operations resulted in the budget level for 2003/04 increasing from $2.1 billion, as originally approved by the General Assembly in June 2003 to $2.8 billion in December 2003 and $3.9 billion in June 2004.
The number of new missions resulted in an increase in the number of military and police personnel deployed compared with the previous period 2002/03.
The peak number of troops deployed during the reporting period increased to 48,988 compared with 34,901 during the period 2002/03, whereas the peak number of civilian police deployed during the reporting period decreased slightly to 5,251 compared to 6,181 during the period 2002/03.
The peak number of military observers increased from 1,929 in 2002/03 to 2,022 in 2003/04 and the peak number of civilian staff in missions decreased slightly from 11,165 in 2002/03 to 10,545 in 2003/04.
During the period under review, the Secretariat continued to improve its performance in the management of peacekeeping operations, resulting from implementation of the recommendations on peacekeeping reforms of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations (Brahimi report).
The achievements of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other departments during the period are elaborated in detail in the results-based frameworks in the present report and the contributions evidenced by the outputs are presented in the addendum to the report.
In the context of the results-based presentation, the performance report demonstrates the actual performance of the offices and departments concerned against the baselines that were established as part of the 2003/04 budget.
The extent to which progress has been made against the expected accomplishments is presented in the results-based frameworks, which compare actual indicators of achievement with planned indicators of achievement.
Information on planned and actual outputs is provided in the addendum to the report.
The present report and its addendum take into account the recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, contained in its report (A/58/760, paras.
5 and 6), as endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 58/298.
Particular efforts have been made to make the frameworks more concrete, streamlined and reader-friendly by applying standard criteria to the performance information provided and by presenting the addendum to the present report in landscape format.
The standard criteria include a justification and planned completion date if actual indicators of achievement and outputs fell significantly short compared to the plan, an element of measurability if not already provided in the baselines that were established as part of the 2003/04 budget and information on significant unplanned actual indicators of achievement and outputs.
The experience in applying these criteria showed, however, that it is difficult to reduce the volume of the results-based presentation in the performance report and its addendum while trying to provide sufficient information to the Member States to enable them to make fully informed decisions on issues regarding peacekeeping.
Resource performance for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004
The resources approved for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 were $112,075,800, from which expenditures amounted to $111,201,000, resulting in an unencumbered balance of $874,800, which represents a budget implementation rate of 99.2 per cent.
The unencumbered balance is attributable primarily to underexpenditure in respect of consultants, official travel, facilities and infrastructure and other supplies, services and equipment.
The unspent balance under “consultants” is attributable to the following factors:
(a) The postponement of the IDEA software training in the Office of Internal Oversight Services, resulting from a management decision to conduct an analysis of information technology risks and to assess the information technology requirements of the Internal Audit Division prior to the selection of a software;
(b) The postponement of a training course for senior managers in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations owing to difficulties in releasing sufficient staff at the senior level to attend, given the increased workload resulting from the surge in peacekeeping activities;
(c) The postponement of the preparation of the Force Headquarters Standard Operating Procedures in the Military Division, scheduled for completion as part of the overall integrated Department of Peacekeeping Operations Guidance Project.
With regard to official travel, the unspent balance resulted mainly from the following factors:
(a) The postponement of a number of planned activities by the Office of Mission Support, Department of Peacekeeping Operations, owing to the requirement for staff of the Civilian Training Section to concentrate on the mission start-up planning and deployment of new operations and development of a civilian training strategy;
(b) The cost savings in the Procurement Division resulting from the combination of management review visits with business seminars in one of the locations.
The unutilized balance under “facilities and infrastructure” resulted from the cancellation of the proposed enhancement to the connectivity services between the Secretariat, the UNITAR building and Nigeria House owing to the difficulties in identifying a cost-effective contractor.
Moreover, during the reporting period, additional office space in the DC-1 building was made available to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations subsequent to the closure of the oil-for-food programme.
The Department was therefore able to consolidate three sections of the Office of Mission Support and vacate most of Nigeria House.
As a result, the planned enhancement to the connectivity services between the Secretariat and Nigeria House was not carried out.
Furthermore, the user requirement for the connectivity in the UNITAR building was deemed satisfactory, therefore making the project unnecessary.
Underexpenditure in regard of other supplies, services and equipment is attributable mainly to the postponement of the printing of various United Nations publications and training materials in the Military Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, resulting from a decision to redirect efforts and resources in support of pre-deployment training and the establishment of mission training cells in new peacekeeping missions.
The publications are scheduled for completion by mid-2005.
The underexpenditure in respect of consultants, official travel, facilities and infrastructure and other supplies, services and equipment are offset by additional requirements in respect of international staff costs and general temporary assistance.
The additional requirements in respect of international staff costs are attributable mainly to lower than budgeted vacancy rates in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and to an increase in the post adjustment multiplier for staff in New York from 46.3 to 53.9 effective September 2003.
The additional requirements in respect of general temporary assistance are due mainly to higher than budgeted common staff costs for the functions of a Database Administrator and an Investment Accountant in the Treasury, to the clearing and prevention of backlogs in processing payments of travel and vendor claims in the Accounts Division, to the assistance in the development and implementation of the Galaxy e-staffing module for field missions in the Operational Services Division and to the higher than budgeted common staff costs relating to the assessment of career development and learning needs of mission personnel in the Division for Organizational Development.

Analysis of variances1
During the reporting period, there was a need to temporarily refocus and prioritize activities in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to deal with the challenges posed by the surge in peacekeeping activity, in particular the establishment of new peacekeeping operations in UNMIL, MINUSTAH, UNOCI and ONUB and the extension of the mandates of UNAMSIL and UNMISET.
In certain areas, this necessitated reprioritization of planned activities towards support for these missions, with various planned projects being postponed.
The underexpenditure under certain categories, namely, “consultants”, “official travel” and “other supplies, services and equipment”, is attributable to this factor.
The additional requirements of $1,390,000 are attributable mainly to lower than budgeted vacancy rates and to the increase in the post adjustment multiplier payable to staff at New York Headquarters from 46.3 to 53.9 effective September 2003.
The overall vacancy rate in the Department was 3.8 per cent compared to a budgeted vacancy rate of 6.5 per cent.
During the reporting period, general temporary assistance was used to replace staff on maternity and sick leave and to strengthen the Department's capacity to meet the additional requirements resulting from the increase in peacekeeping operations.
The additional requirements of $15,700 resulted primarily from the assistance provided to the team working on preparations and support for the meeting of the 2004 Working Group on Contingent-owned Equipment.
The unspent balance of $78,000 is attributable primarily to the postponement of the people management training for senior staff in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations owing to the unavailability of senior staff as a result of increased workload caused by the surge in peacekeeping operations; cancellation of the evaluation of MONUC, given the operational demands facing the Mission at the time and the postponement of the preparation of the Force Headquarters standard operating procedures in the Military Division, which will be completed as part of the overall integrated Department of Peacekeeping Operations guidance project.
The unspent balance of $107,600 is attributable mainly to the postponement of the peacekeeping management course, one rapid deployment training course and two mission planning skills courses to enable the Civilian Training Section in the Office of Mission Support to concentrate its efforts on the mission start-up planning and deployment of new peacekeeping operations and the development of a civilian training strategy.
The unspent balance of $71,600 is the result of lower than budgeted costs allocated by the Information Technology Services Division for the rental of photocopy machines.
The unspent balance of $216,500 relates mostly to the postponement of printing of various United Nations publications and training materials to enable the Training and Evaluation Services of the Military Division to redirect its efforts and resources during the period towards pre-deployment training and the establishment of mission training cells in response to the surge in peacekeeping operations.
The training publications are due for completion in the current fiscal year 2004/05.

Analysis of variances1
The unspent balance of $669,000 is attributable to higher than budgeted vacancy rates and to the appointment of most of the resident auditors under the 300 series of the Staff Rules and Regulations.
During the reporting period, the overall average vacancy in the office was 14.5 per cent.
The unspent balance of $8,500 resulted from delays in the recruitment of a General Service staff offset by additional requirements in the Executive Office and the Monitoring, Evaluation and Consulting Division.
The unutilized balance of $64,400 relates to the postponement of the training on IDEA software resulting from a management decision to conduct an analysis of the information technology software risks and to assess the information technology requirements of the Internal Audit Division prior to the selection of a software and to delays in purchasing additional licences for the electronic working papers, as the office was awaiting results from the pilot project.
The IDEA training will be conducted in the current period (2004/05).
The unspent balance also relates to the non-utilization of the provision made for the training on methodology, monitoring and reporting on programme performance in the Monitoring, Evaluation and Consulting Division, for which the Division received extrabudgetary funding from UNFIP.
The additional requirements of $4,300 are attributable to the purchase of alarm systems and smoke detectors for the establishment of the Investigations Division Office in Vienna of the Office of Internal Oversight Services owing to the policy of the United Nations Office at Vienna to have such systems in locked offices.
The unspent balance of $9,000 is the result of telephone and fax-related expenses of the Investigations Unit, Vienna, being charged to the United Nations Office at Vienna.
The unspent balance of $20,000 is attributable to lower requirements under the maintenance of information technology equipment.
The unspent balance of $68,300 relates to lower actual costs of training resulting from the use of online courses, the customization of the course for change management and to the cancellation of planned impact assessment training owing to staff being engaged in other projects.

Analysis of resource variances1
The unutilized balance of $62,200 relates to the vacancy of one post for one month and one post being encumbered by a staff at a lower level.
During the reporting period, the overall vacancy rate in the office was 5 per cent.
During the reporting period, travel plans were made for two Senior Legal Officers to visit MONUC.
The Mission was considered a priority owing to the complexity of its legal issues.
However, because of security concerns, the travel plans were cancelled.
The cost of the unused tickets has been reimbursed to the Organization.
The unspent balance of $9,000 is attributable to the expenses related to the maintenance of information technology equipment being charged to the regular budget.

a Reflects accommodation costs for all offices.
The net saving of $317,900 was attributable primarily to higher than budgeted vacancy rates and the incumbency of posts at lower than budgeted levels in the Office of Human Resources Management and the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts.
The additional requirement of $98,700 results mainly from higher than budgeted staff costs owing to the unforeseen general temporary assistance requirements related to the implementation of the enhancements for the Galaxy e-Staffing module in the Operational Services Division of the Office of Human Resources Management.
The savings of $130,100 were primarily in the Procurement Division as a result of combining mission visits with a business seminar in the Africa region.
The Peacekeeping Financing Division undertook fewer mission visits than planned in order to support the establishment of three new peacekeeping missions in the spring of 2004, which also resulted in savings.
Savings of $392,900 resulted when the improvements to the network connectivity between the United Nations Secretariat, the UNITAR building and Nigeria House were not undertaken owing to difficulties in identifying a cost-effective contractor.
With the closure of the Office of the Iraq Programme, additional office space in the DC-1 building became available for occupancy by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
The Department was able to consolidate three sections of its Office of Mission Support and vacate Nigeria House.
As a result, the planned enhancement to the connectivity services between the Secretariat and Nigeria House was no longer necessary.
The overexpenditure of $145,100 was attributed mainly to the purchase of five additional OPICS licences for the implementation of the SWIFT electronic payment system in Treasury.
An unutilized balance of $140,230 was realized mostly in Treasury by the absorption of $41,680 in bank charges by the regular budget and by financial institutions waiving fees for training venues.

Analysis of resource variances1
The unutilized balance of $9,900 relates to lower requirements under training-related travel that resulted from the cost of four participants being paid for by their departments.
The unutilized balance of $1,400 resulted from charging the requirements under this class to the regular budget.
The unspent balance of $15,700 resulted from charging the requirements under this class to the regular budget.
The additional requirements of $2,600 relate to the acquisition of three laptops purchased during the period for the training sessions offset by lower requirements for the maintenance of information technology equipment.
