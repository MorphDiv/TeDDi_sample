Disable Actions for Windows of Type WM_CLASS
This lets you specify windows in which Klipper should not invoke "actions". Use xprop | grep WM_CLASS in a terminal to find out the WM_CLASS of a window. Next, click on the window you want to examine. The first string it outputs after the equal sign is the one you need to enter here.

Keep clipboard contents
Selecting this option has the effect, that the clipboard can never be emptied. E. g. when an application exits, the clipboard would usually be emptied.
When an area of the screen is selected with mouse or keyboard, this is called "the selection". If this option is set, the selection is not entered into the clipboard history, though it is still available for pasting using the middle mouse button.
Synchronize clipboard and selection
When an area of the screen is selected with mouse or keyboard, this is called "the selection". If this option is selected, the selection and the clipboard is kept the same, so that anything in the selection is immediately available for pasting elsewhere using any method, including the traditional middle mouse button. Otherwise, the selection is recorded in the clipboard history, but the selection can only be pasted using the middle mouse button. Also see the'Ignore Selection 'option.
Selection text only
When an area of the screen is selected with mouse or keyboard, this is called "the selection". If this option is selected, only text selections are stored in the history, while images and other selections are not.

Strip whitespace when executing an action
Sometimes, the selected text has some whitespace at the end, which, if loaded as URL in a browser would cause an error. Enabling this option removes any whitespace at the beginning or end of the selected string (the original clipboard contents will not be modified).

Clipboard/ Selection Behavior
Separate clipboard and selection
This option prevents the selection being recorded in the clipboard history. Only explicit clipboard changes are recorded.
There are two different clipboard buffers available: Clipboard is filled by selecting something and pressing Ctrl+C, or by clicking "Copy" in a toolbar or menubar. Selection is available immediately after selecting some text. The only way to access the selection is to press the middle mouse button. You can configure the relationship between Clipboard and Selection.
Klipper - clipboard tool
Action list (right click to add/ remove commands):
Double-click here to set the command to be executed
Double-click here to set the regular expression

Selecting this option synchronizes these two buffers.
Using this option will only set the selection when highlighting something and the clipboard when choosing e. g. "Copy" in a menubar.
& Use graphical editor for editing regular expressions
Click on a highlighted item's column to change it. "%s" in a command will be replaced with the clipboard contents.
