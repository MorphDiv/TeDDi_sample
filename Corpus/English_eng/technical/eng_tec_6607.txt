SSL Ciphers to Use
Select the ciphers you wish to enable when using the SSL protocol. The actual protocol used will be negotiated with the server at connection time.
Cipher Wizard
Strong Ciphers Only
Export Ciphers Only
Enable All
Use these preconfigurations to more easily configure the SSL encryption settings. You can choose among the following modes: Strong Ciphers Only: Select only the strong (gt; = 128 bit) encryption ciphers. Export Ciphers Only: Select only the weak ciphers (lt; = 56 bit). Enable All: Select all SSL ciphers and methods.
Warn on & entering SSL mode
If selected, you will be notified when entering an SSL enabled site
Warn on & leaving SSL mode
If selected, you will be notified when leaving an SSL based site.
Warn on sending & unencrypted data
If selected, you will be notified before sending unencrypted data via a web browser.
Warn on & mixed SSL/ non-SSL pages
If selected, you will be notified if you view a page that has both encrypted and non-encrypted parts.
Path to OpenSSL Shared Libraries

Use EGD
Use entropy file
Path to EGD:
If selected, OpenSSL will be asked to use the entropy gathering daemon (EGD) for initializing the pseudo-random number generator.
If selected, OpenSSL will be asked to use the given file as entropy for initializing the pseudo-random number generator.
Enter the path to the socket created by the entropy gathering daemon (or the entropy file) here.

Enable & TLS support if supported by the server
TLS is the newest revision of the SSL protocol. It integrates better with other protocols and has replaced SSL in protocols such as POP3 and SMTP.
Enable SSLv2
SSL v2 is the second revision of the SSL protocol. It is most common to enable v2 and v3.
Enable SSLv3
SSL v3 is the third revision of the SSL protocol. It is most common to enable v2 and v3.
SSL ciphers cannot be configured because this module was not linked with OpenSSL.
SSLv3 Ciphers to Use
Select the ciphers you wish to enable when using the SSL v3 protocol. The actual protocol used will be negotiated with the server at connection time.
Most Compatible
Most Compatible: Select the settings found to be most compatible.
If you do not select at least one SSL algorithm, either SSL will not work or the application may be forced to choose a suitable default.
If you do not select at least one cipher, SSLv3 will not work.
