Using & ksystemlog;
Introduction
What is & ksystemlog;?
& ksystemlog; is a system log viewer tool.
& ksystemlog; helps users understand what their machine does in the background. & ksystemlog; aims to simplify the reading of system log files. This program is developed for beginner users who do n't know how to find information about their system or where the log files are located in their computer.
But it is also designed for advanced users who want to quickly see problems occuring on their server. & ksystemlog; tries to provide some advanced features to allow sorting and reading logs from specifical programs.

Features
In its current version, & ksystemlog; 0.4.1 has quite a number of helpful features, such as:
Support for many different log files type, with the support of Syslog server formating, Samba
Tabbed view to display several logs at the same time
Reading one log mode from multiple sources
Auto-display of newly logged lines in bold
Group by different criteria (log level, log file, process, hour,...)
Detailed information for each log lines
Adding a log entry manually
It supports the following log files from your system:
Syslog logs (system messages)
X. org logs
Kernel logs
Authentication logs
ACPID logs
Cups logs
Postfix logs
Apache logs
Samba logs
Daemons logs
Cron logs
XSessions logs
Many other features are included and will be discussed in the appropriate chapters of this manual.
Reading logs with & ksystemlog;
As you will see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; provides features to easily sort and filter log lines. We are now going to describe them in the next parts of this documentation.
Getting started
When you start & ksystemlog;, it tries to open the most useful log, the System Log. If it does not display it and pops up a message box, you probably forgot to launch & ksystemlog; as an administrator user (commonly named root). The log files are usually available in the / var/ log folder, which is often protected against normal users.

Reading log files easily
Sorting log lines
Every log lines are displayed in a list view, which can be sorted by clicking on the wanted column. Another click will sort it in the other order. If you want to sort the list as it was on the first loading, you can use the Edit Refresh menu item, or simply click on the first column of the list, generally named Date, to sort the list in the ascending order. Even if your log mode does not use time to describe each log lines, for example the X. org Log, the list will be correctly sorted, because & ksystemlog; keeps an internal order of the list.
Filtering log lines
Filtering on a specific process
Filtering on a specific process
You can also use the filter bar to filter according to the selected criteria and the typed string. Simply type something in the filter, and the list will automatically be modified to only display lines which match your filter string. By default, the combo box next to the filter selects All, which means that a line will be displayed only if one of its columns contains the filter string.
You can select another field to filter only this column of the list. For example, in the System Log, by selecting the Process column, and writing its name in the filter bar, & ksystemlog; will display every log lines sent by this process.
Other features
Colorizing log lines
This option is activated by default and helps you see which lines have a higher level than the others. For example, Error level will be highlighted in a different color than the Notice one. This feature can be disabled in the configuration dialog.
Hiding the process identifier
If you are only interested in a specific process (for example in the System Log or the Cron Log), you can hide its PID in the Process column. This can be useful if you are trying to analyze the output of a specific command, like a Samba server. In this case, please use the Filter Bar.
Monitoring Management
& ksystemlog; provides an easy way to control the reading and the monitoring of log files. Indeed, sometimes you only need to analyze some existing log lines. In this case, you cannot tolerate the appearance of a new line. You can deactivate the monitoring of log files by clicking on the Stop button. This stops the opened log files from being updated while still letting them get filled by other processes. Of course, you can reactivate the monitoring by clicking on Resume, which will display the log lines added since the last pause.
Furthermore, to focus on the newly appeared log lines, you can toggle the Scroll to New Lines option.
Management of several opened tabs
& ksystemlog; allows you to open several log modes by opening multiple tabs. For this, simply use the Window menu to manage and open new tabs. Once you have selected the right tab, simply choose the desired log mode using the dedicated menu.

The & ktouch; main menu and program dialogs
In this chapter we look@some of the details in the program.
You can use the What's this? feature (the little question mark besides the minimize/ maximize window buttons) in many dialogs of the program.
The menu of & ktouch;
Pretty much everything in the & ktouch; menu should be self-explanatory. The file menu contains options to load a user defined lecture and edit lectures. The training menu contains training options and the settings menu contains options to setup the program. The various options in the configuration dialog are explained in the next section.
Configuration options for & ktouch;
You can customize & ktouch; quite a bit. The settings are always stored for the current user of the program. Open the configuration dialog via Settings Configure & ktouch;....
General Options
In this dialog you can change general options that control the behaviour of & ktouch;.
General options
General options
First of all you can switch the sound on or off (might be useful in class rooms). You can also set the sliding speed of the teacher's and student's line.
Most important, however, might be the selection of the lecture font. When showing the teacher's text & ktouch; will normally use the font specified in the lecture file. But if this font does n't exist on your system or none has been specified, & ktouch; uses a default system font. What if this font does not contain all characters needed for your lecture? In such cases you can override the choice of the font and specify any font you like.
& ktouch; distinguishes between lecture and keyboard fonts. Overriding the lecture font does not automatically adjust the keyboard font as well. Use the appropriate option in the Keyboard Options configuration page.
Training Options
In this dialog you can select the options that control how & ktouch; changes difficulty levels based on the user's skill.
If Automatic level adjustment is enabled, & ktouch; checks the given limits@the end of each level and decides whether to increase or decrease the level or stay in the level for another run. Level changes occur always@the end of a level (ie; when the user has finished the last line of a level). If the typing speed (in characters per seconds) and accuracy (correctness) are both above or equal to the Limits to increase level & ktouch; will jump to the next higher level. If either typing speed or accuracy falls below the Limits to decrease level & ktouch; will jump back to the previous lower level.
On this configuration page you can also select that the program remembers your current level when you quit the program and jumps back to it when you restart & ktouch;.
Keyboard Options
In this dialog you can select keyboard specific options.
Keyboard options
Keyboard options
This dialog controls the appearance and functionality of the keyboard. Similar to the Override lecture font option in the general settings configuration page, you can here specify your own keyboard font. The option Highlight keys on keyboard can be used to increase the difficulty of the training.
Once you are familiar with the keyboard you may want to turn keyboard highlighting off so it wo n't distract you when you concentrate on the teacher's text.
Color Options
In this dialog you can tweak the appearance of & ktouch;.
This configuration page does not need much explaination. You can choose among four predefined color schemes for the keyboard. Alternatively you can switch the color schemes on the fly using the menu option Settings Keyboard Color Schemes.
