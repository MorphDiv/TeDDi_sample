(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
pg_delete() deletes record condition specified by assoc_array which has field= value.
If option is specified, pg_convert() is applied to assoc_array with specified option.
Example 1. pg_delete
?php $db = pg_connect ('dbname=foo'); / / This is safe, since $_POST is converted automatically $res = pg_delete($db, 'post_log', $_POST); if ($res) {echo "POST data is deleted: $res\n";} else {echo "User must have sent wrong inputs\n";}?
Note:
This function is experimental.
