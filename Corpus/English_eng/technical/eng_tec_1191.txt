Fine-Tuning the Word Completion for Text Documents
MW created this guide by splitting word_completion.xhp
If you like it that $[officename] automatically completes the words that you frequently use, you can make further adjustments to refine that behaviour.
If you want, you can also save the current list of collected words so that it can be used in subsequent sessions.
Tools â€“ AutoCorrect Options - Word Completion
and select any of the following options:
To Insert an Additional Space Character
Append space
.
The space character is appended after you type the first character of the next word after the auto-completed word.
The space character is suppressed if the next character is a delimiter, such as a full stop or a new line character.
To Define the Accept Key
Accept with
list box.
To Select the Minimum Number of Characters
Minimum word length
box to set the minimum number of characters a word must have to be collected into the list.
To Select the Scope of Collected Words
When closing a document, save the list for later use in other documents
.
Now the list is also valid for other documents that you open.
When you close the last %PRODUCTNAME document, the word list is deleted.
If you do not mark the check box, the list is only valid as long as the current document is open.
If you want the word list to exist longer than the current %PRODUCTNAME session, save it as a document, as described in the following section.
To Use the Word List for Further Sessions
If the automatic spell-check option is enabled, only the words that are recognised by the spell-check are collected.
Use the word list to always start with a defined set of technical terms for the word completion feature.
Open the text document that contains the terms that you want to use for word completion.
The word completion feature collects the words.
Select all or some of the words in the list.
Command
Ctrl
+C to copy all selected words into the clipboard.
Paste the clipboard into a new document and save it to get a reference list of collected words.
Later you can open the reference list and automatically collect the words, so that the word completion feature starts with a defined set of words.
