In "Slideshow Mode", it chooses random images and displays them within the limitations of the Apple ][ display hardware. (Six available colors in hi-res mode!)

Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

To make it easier to visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of each face. Do n't think about it too long, or your brain will melt.

This generates random cloud-like patterns. The idea is to take four points on the edge of the image, and assign each a random "elevation". Then find the point between them, and give it a value which is the average of the other four, plus some small random offset. Coloration is done based on elevation. Written by Juergen Nickelsen and Jamie Zawinski; 1992.
A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. Though actually it does n't look like circles at all!

A surface is filled with a hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. Displays the instantaneous intersections of the circles as well as the aggregate intersections of the circles. The circles begin with a radius of 1 pixel and slowly increase to some arbitrary size. Circles are drawn with small moving points along the perimeter. The intersections are rendered as glowing orbs. Glowing orbs are rendered only when a perimeter point moves past the intersection point. Written by Casey Reas, William Ngan, Robert Hodgin, and Jamie Zawinski; 2004.

Tetrahedron
This does bad things with quasi-spherical objects. You have a tetrahedron with tesselated faces. The vertices on these faces have forces on them: one proportional to the distance from the surface of a sphere; and one proportional to the distance from the neighbors. They also have inertia. The resulting effect can range from a shape that does nothing, to a frenetic polygon storm. Somewhere in between there it usually manifests as a blob that jiggles in a kind of disturbing manner.

This screen saver is not meant to look pretty, but rather, to repair burn-in on LCD monitors. Believe it or not, screen burn is not a thing of the past. It can happen to LCD screens pretty easily, even in this modern age. However, leaving the screen on and displaying high contrast images can often repair the damage. That's what this screen saver does.

Penrose said he does n't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken."

These closed objects are commonly called spherical harmonics, although they are only remotely related to the mathematical definition found in the solution to certain wave functions, most notably the eigenfunctions of angular momentum operators. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Spherical_harmonics#Visualization_of_the_spherical_harmonics Written by Paul Bourke and Jamie Zawinski; 2002.

Pulsating blob
Starfish
This generates a sequence of undulating, throbbing, star-like patterns which pulsate, rotate, and turn inside out. Another display mode uses these shapes to lay down a field of colors, which are then cycled. The motion is very organic. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1997.

Chains of colorful squares dance around each other in complex spiral patterns. Inspired by David Tristram's ` electropaint 'screen saver, originally written for SGI computers in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Written by Andrew Plotkin; 2001.

Image directory
This is a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the system's video input, and then uses some PBM filters (chosen at random) to manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge detection, subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself, etc.) Then it displays that image for a few seconds, and does it again. This works really well if you just feed broadcast television into it. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1998.

Generates a continuous sequence of small, curvy geometric patterns. Written by Tracy Camp and David Hansen; 1997.

Draws a randomly-colored Voronoi tessellation, and periodically zooms in and adds new points. The existing points also wander around. There are a set of control points on the plane, each at the center of a colored cell. Every pixel within that cell is closer to that cell's control point than to any other control point. That is what determines the cell's shapes. http: / /en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Voronoi_diagram Written by Jamie Zawinski; 2007.

This makes collages out of random images pulled off of the World Wide Web. It finds these images by doing random web searches, and then extracting images from the returned pages. WARNING: THE INTERNET SOMETIMES CONTAINS PORNOGRAPHY. The Internet being what it is, absolutely anything might show up in the collage including -- quite possibly -- pornography, or even nudity. Please act accordingly. See also http: / /www. jwz. org/ webcollage/ Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.

XAnalogTV
XAnalogTV shows a detailed simulation of an old TV set showing various test patterns, with various picture artifacts like snow, bloom, distortion, ghosting, and hash noise. It also simulates the TV warming up. It will cycle through 12 channels, some with images you give it, and some with color bars or nothing but static. Written by Trevor Blackwell; 2003.
