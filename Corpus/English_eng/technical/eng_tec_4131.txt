(PHP 4 = 4.0.4)
ob_gzhandler() is intended to be used as a callback function for ob_start() to help facilitate sending gz-encoded data to web browsers that support compressed web pages.
Before ob_gzhandler() actually sends compressed data, it determines what type of content encoding the browser will accept ("gzip", "deflate "or none at all) and will return it's output accordingly.
All browsers are supported since it 's up to the browser to send the correct header saying that it accepts compressed web pages.
Note:
You cannot use both ob_gzhandler() and ini.zlib.output_compression.
Also note that using ini.zlib.output_compression is preferred over ob_gzhandler().
Example 1. ob_gzhandler() Example
?php ob_start( "ob_gzhandler");? html body p This should be a compressed page. / html body
See also ob_start() and ob_end_flush().
