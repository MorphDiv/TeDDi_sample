The Kipi Advanced Slide Show plugin creates a configurable full screen slideshow of your images.
KDE
Kipi
Introduction
With this Kipi-plugin you create a perfect slide show with 3 mouse clicks.
The Settings Dialog
Upon opening of the plugin from the host application the Advanced Slide Show window will appear asking questions as to how you want to stage your slideshow. You can choose between the selected images and all images in the same album.
The Use OpenGL Slideshow Transitions checkbox enables very smooth image transitions using the OpenGL display mode. Be sure to have OpenGL enabled on your graphics card, since otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.
The Print Filename checkbox enables the image filename to be displayed in the lower left corner.
The Loop checkbox enabled will run the whole show in an endless loop (until manually stopped with Esc;).
The Shuffle Image checkbox enables to display randomly the images (not using the current images collection order).
The Delay Between Images may be set in millisecond steps. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. The best timing depends also a bit on your computer power and the transition effect. Try it out before you show it to your friends!
There are more than a dozen Transition Effects available which you can choose from. The Random selection will change the transition effect with every image.
The Slideshow Dialog
Slide Show in Action
During slideshow, user can access to a tool bar on the upper left screen corner. Move the mouse cursor to the top left of the screen for enable it.
With this tool bar, user can drive the progress, for pausing/ playing slideshow, back to the preview image, go to the next image, and stopping slideshow.
On the lower left screen corner you can see the current image file name, the current image id on the slideshow, and the total number of images include in.
