SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Altargo 1% ointment
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
1 g contains 10 mg retapamulin (1% w/ w).
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Ointment
Smooth, off-white ointment.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Short term treatment of the following superficial skin infections:
Impetigo.
Infected small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds.
See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information regarding the clinical activity of retapamulin against different types of Staphylococcus aureus.
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Retapamulin is for cutaneous use only.
Adults (aged 18-65 years), adolescents (aged 12-17 years), infants and children (aged from nine months to 11 years)
A thin layer of ointment should be applied to the affected area twice daily for five days.
The area treated may be covered with sterile bandage or gauze dressing.
Safety and efficacy have not been established in the following:
• Impetiginous lesions > 10 in number and exceeding 100 cm2 in total surface area.
• Infected lesions that exceed 10 cm in length or a total surface area > 100 cm2.
In patients aged less than 18 years the total surface area treated should be no more than 2% of the body surface area.
2 Patients not showing a clinical response within two to three days should be re-evaluated and alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).
Infants under nine months of age
The safety and efficacy of retapamulin ointment has not been established in paediatric patients less than nine months of age.
Elderly (aged 65 and older)
No dosage adjustment is necessary.
Renal impairment
No dosage adjustment is necessary.
See section 5.3.
Hepatic impairment
No dosage adjustment is necessary.
See section 5.3.
4.3 Contraindications
Known or suspected hypersensitivity to retapamulin or to the excipient.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In the event of a sensitisation or severe local irritation from the use of retapamulin ointment, treatment should be discontinued, the ointment carefully wiped off, and appropriate alternative therapy for the infection instituted.
Retapamulin ointment must be kept away from the eyes and mucous membranes.
Care must be taken to avoid ingestion.
Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections known or thought likely to be due to MRSA (see section 5.1).
In clinical studies of secondarily infected open wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin was inadequate in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
The reason for the reduced clinical efficacy observed in these patients is unknown.
Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or a worsening in the infected area after 2-3 days of treatment.
Retapamulin should not be used to treat abscesses.
Retapamulin ointment contains butylated hydroxytoluene, which may cause local skin reaction (e. g. contact dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes.
As with other antibacterial agents, prolonged use of retapamulin may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms, including fungi.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The effect of concurrent application of retapamulin and other topical products to the same area of skin has not been studied, and is not recommended.
3 In human liver microsomes, retapamulin was a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4.
Based on the low plasma concentration achieved in humans after topical application to abraded skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition is not expected in vivo (see section 5.2)
Co-administration of oral ketoconazole 200mg twice daily increased mean retapamulin AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 81% after topical application of retapamulin 1% ointment on the abraded skin of healthy adult males.
Due to low systemic exposure following topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are considered to be unnecessary when topical retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral administration and are insufficient with respect to effects on parturition and fetal/ postnatal development (see Section 5.3).
Retapamulin ointment should only be used in pregnancy when topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is considered to be preferable to administration of a systemic antibacterial agent.
Lactation It is unknown whether retapamulin is excreted in human breast milk.
Minimal systemic exposure is observed in adults, therefore exposure of the breast-feeding infant is likely to be negligible.
The excretion of retapamulin in milk has not been studied in animals.
A decision on whether to continue/ discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/ discontinue therapy with Altargo should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Altargo therapy to the woman.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Altargo is administered topically and is unlikely to have an effect on the ability to drive or use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In clinical studies in which 2150 patients with superficial skin infections applied Altargo, the most commonly reported adverse reaction was application site irritation, which affected approximately 1% of patients.
The following convention has been used for the classification of frequency:
Common Uncommon
> 1/ 100 to< 1/10 > 1/1000 to< 1/100
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Dermatologicals
ATC code:
D06AX13
Mode of action
Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of the compound pleuromutilin, which is isolated through fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).
Retapamulin selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting at a unique site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome that is distinct from the binding sites of other non- pleuromutilin antibacterial agents that interact with the ribosome.
Data indicate that the binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and peptidyl transferase centre.
By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl transfer, partially block P-site interactions, and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.
Therefore the pleuromutilins appear to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by multiple mechanisms.
Retapamulin is predominantly bacteriostatic against S. aureus and S. pyogenes.
Mechanism of Resistance
Due to its distinct mechanism of action, retapamulin does not demonstrate target specific cross-resistance with other classes of antibacterial agents.
In vitro, two mechanisms have been identified which reduce susceptibility to retapamulin.
One involves mutations in ribosomal protein L3, the other is a non- specific efflux mechanism (ABC transporter vgaAv).
This non-target specific efflux mechanism has also been demonstrated to reduce the in vitro activity of streptogramin A.
5 No development of resistance was observed during treatment with retapamulin in the clinical study programme and all clinical isolates were inhibited by retapamulin concentrations of < 2µg/ ml.
Antibacterial spectrum
The prevalence of acquired resistance may vary geographically and with time for selected species, and local information on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections.
As necessary, expert advice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the agent in at least some types of infection is questionable.
Commonly susceptible species
Staphylococcus aureus* $
Streptococcus pyogenes*
Streptococcus agalactiae
Inherently resistant organisms
Enterobacteriaceae
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Enterococcus faecalis
$In vitro, retapamulin was equally active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin- resistant strains of S. aureus.
However, see section 4.4 and below regarding clinical efficacy against MRSA.
Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections known or thought likely to be due to MRSA.
* Activity has been satisfactorily demonstrated in clinical studies
Information from clinical trials
Very few MRSA were isolated in studies in impetigo and all were clinical successes (100%:
8/ 8).
In studies in impetigo and in two studies of secondarily infected open wounds (SIOW), clinical success rates were high for retapamulin in patients with mupirocin-resistant S. aureus (100%:
11/ 11) or fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus (96.7%:
29/ 30).
However, in the two studies that enrolled patients with SIOW the efficacy of retapamulin in infections due to MRSA was inadequate (75.7%).
No differences were observed in the in vitro activity of retapamulin versus S. aureus whether the isolates were susceptible or resistant to methicillin.
The explanation for lower clinical efficacy against MRSA in SIOW is unclear and it may have been influenced by the presence of a particular MRSA clone.
In the case of treatment failure associated with S. aureus, the presence of strains possessing additional virulence factors (such as Panton-Valentine Leukocidin) should be considered.

5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
In a study of healthy adult subjects, 1% retapamulin ointment was applied daily to intact and to abraded skin under occlusion for up to 7 days.
Systemic exposure following topical application of retapamulin through intact skin was very low.
The geometric mean Cmax value in plasma after application to 200 cm2 of abraded skin was 9.75 ng/ ml on day 1 and 8.79 ng/ ml on day 7 and the maximum individual systemic exposure (Cmax) recorded was 22.1 ng/ ml.
Single plasma samples were obtained from 516 adult and paediatric patients who received topical treatment with retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions.
Sampling occurred pre-dose for adult subjects on days 3 or 4, and between 0-12 hours after the last application for paediatric subjects on days 3 or 4.
The majority of samples (89%) were below the lower limit of quantitation (0.5 ng/ ml).
Of the samples that had measurable concentrations 90% had retapamulin concentrations less than 2.5 ng/ ml.
The maximum measured plasma concentration of retapamulin was 10.7 ng/ ml in adults and 18.5 ng/ ml in paediatric patients.
Distribution
Due to the very low systemic exposures, tissue distribution of retapamulin has not been investigated in humans.
In vitro, retapamulin was shown to be a P-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate and inhibitor.
However, the maximum individual systemic exposure in humans following topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of abraded skin (Cmax= 22 ng/ ml; AUC(0-24) = 238 ng. h/ ml) was 660-fold lower than the retapamulin IC50 for Pgp inhibition.
Retapamulin is approximately 94% bound to human plasma proteins.
Metabolism
The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with minor contributions from CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).
Elimination
Retapamulin elimination in humans has not been investigated.
7 Special Patient Populations
No pharmacokinetic data are available in children aged less than 2 years, or in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
However, due to the low systemic plasma levels that have been observed, no safety problems are foreseen.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Repeated-dose toxicity
In 14-day (50, 150 or 450 mg/ kg) oral toxicity studies in rats there was evidence of adaptive hepatic and thyroid changes.
Neither of these findings is of clinical relevance.
In monkeys dosed orally (50, 150 or 450 mg/ kg) for 14 days there was dose-related emesis.
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, reproductive toxicity
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with retapamulin.
There was no evidence of genotoxicity when evaluated in vitro for gene mutation and/ or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma cell assay, in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes, or when evaluated in vivo for chromosomal effects in a rat micronucleus test.
There was no evidence of impaired fertility in male or female rats at oral doses of 50, 150, or 450 mg/ kg/ day, resulting in exposure margins of up to 5-times the highest human estimated exposure (topical application to 200 cm2 abraded skin:
AUC 238 ng. h/ ml).
In an embryotoxicity study in rats, developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and delayed skeletal ossification) and maternal toxicity were observed at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg/ kg/ day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the human estimated exposure (see above).
There were no treatment-related malformations in rats.
Retapamulin was given as a continuous intravenous infusion to pregnant rabbits from day 7 to day 19 of gestation.
Maternal toxicity was demonstrated at dosages of ≥ 7.2 mg/ kg/ day corresponding to ≥ 8 times the estimated human exposure (see above).
There was no treatment-related effect on embryo-fetal development.
No studies to evaluate effects of retapamulin on pre-/ postnatal development were performed.
However, there were no systemic effects on juvenile rats with topical application of retapamulin ointment.
