Agenda Wizard
Starts the wizard to help you create an agenda template.
You can use an agenda to specify discussion topics for conferences and meetings.
$[officename] comes with a sample template for agendas that you can modify to suit your own needs.
The wizard offers numerous layout and design options for creating document templates.
The preview gives you an impression of how the finished agenda will appear.
Within the wizard, you can modify your entries at any time.
You may also skip an entire page or even all the pages, in which case the current (or default) settings remain in effect.
Back
Returns to the selections made on the previous page.
The current settings remain in effect.
This button only becomes active after the first page.
Next
The wizard saves the current settings and goes to the next page.
Once you reach the last page, this button will become inactive.
Finish
According to your selections, the wizard creates a document template and saves it on your hard disc.
A new document based on the template appears in the work area, with the filename &quot; UntitledX &quot; (X stands for an automatic number).
$[officename] saves the current settings in the wizard according to the selected document template.
These will be used as the default settings the next time you activate the wizard.
