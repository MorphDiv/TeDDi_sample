File properties
Overview
The File Properties dialog allows you to choose various options that will apply only to a particular file, stream, device, track, title, or channel. Many of the options are the same or similar to the ones that can be chosen globally in the kplayer; Settings dialog. The options set in file properties will override the global ones. Additionally, options set for a track, title or channel will override options set for the disk or device it comes from. The file properties give you full control of how the file is played, including options that are passed to & mplayer;. Other properties display information that & kplayer; found out about the file or stream, like time length, video size, and audio and video bitrates.
Select File Properties... to open the dialog box for the currently loaded file or URL. You can also open the properties for any item in the multimedia library by right clicking the item and selecting Properties... from the library popup menu or by selecting Library Properties....
The dialog contains several sections which are selected by left clicking one of the items on the left side of the dialog box.
General section
Shows general information about the multimedia item and lets you set a few essential properties.
Size section
If the file or stream contains video, tells you the video resolution and lets you control the video area size when playing it.
Video section
Contains properties that show technical information about the video and let you control video output when playing the file, if it has a video component.
Audio section
Contains properties that show technical information about the audio and let you control audio output when playing the file, if it has an audio component.
Subtitles section
Contains properties that control subtitle loading and display, if the file is played with subtitles.
Advanced section
Contains various properties that affect advanced command line parameters passed to & mplayer;, as well as interaction with the & kde; I/ O Slave if it is used to transfer the file.
The buttons at the bottom of the dialog let you make choices about the contents of all sections of the dialog.
OK button
Accepts your changes and closes the dialog.
Cancel button
Closes the dialog without saving the changes.
Apply button
Applies the changes without closing the dialog.

Help button
Opens this user manual and displays the section that describes the currently selected section of the dialog.
You can also click the small What's This button with a question mark at the top right of the dialog and then click a property to get a brief explanation of it.
Clicking the rightmost button at the top of the dialog closes the dialog discarding any unapplied changes.
General section
This section shows general information about the multimedia item and lets you set a few essential properties.
Name
This property shows and lets you change the name of the item that is displayed in the playlist drop down box, the multimedia library, and also in the & kplayer; title bar when the item is loaded for playing.
Path or URL
This property shows the file path for local files or the full URL for all other files. The URL identifies the file or stream, and all other properties are attached to it. This property is read only. It is not applicable and not shown for CD tracks, DVD titles and tuner device channels.
Type
This property shows the type of the multimedia item. For a device, track, title or channel it is the device type. For other items it is the MIME type if it is known. This property is read only.
Playlist
This property shows and lets you choose whether this item is a playlist file. & mplayer; cannot automatically detect and play a playlist file, so & kplayer; has to explicitly tell it to parse a file as a playlist. Auto lets & kplayer; use the file extension to guess if it is a playlist file. The playlist extensions KPlayer recognizes are ram, rpm, smi, smil, asx, m3u, pls and strm. If a file that is not a playlist has one of these extensions, or a playlist file has a different extension, you will need to correctly set this property in order to be able to play the file or stream.
This property is not applicable and not shown for devices, disks, titles, tracks and channels.
Length
This property shows the time length of the file. & kplayer; tries to detect it with precision of one tenth of a second, and usually it gets it pretty close to the real length. This property is read only. It is not applicable and not shown for devices and channels.
Tuner devices like DVB, PVR and TV and channels available on them have some specific properties that are not applicable to other items.

For now it is not possible to change the URL, you have to create a new playlist entry instead, by using File Open or File Open URL commands, by dragging and dropping files onto & kplayer; window, or by starting & kplayer; with the new URL as the command line argument.
This property lets you choose the full screen or maximized window state for this file. Normally you would simply leave this at the default setting, which will keep the full screen or maximized state of the previous file. The normal setting will force normal windowed mode for this file, the full screen setting will force full screen mode unless it is an audio only file, and the maximized setting will force maximized window mode.
