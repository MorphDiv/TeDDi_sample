ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Kraschinski Arnold
With & kverbos; you can study Spanish verb conjugations. It's main purpose is to learn the different forms of the verbs but it can be used to look up the forms of a verb, too.
KDE
KVerbos
Education
Spanish
Introduction
& kverbos; helps learning Spanish verb conjugation. In contrast to the old 1. x version it is n't necessary for the user to capture verb data before learning. & kverbos; comes with a set of more than 9 000 verbs and the corresponding conjugation patterns. This does not mean that the program can answer every question about Spanish verbs now. It is not the result of linguistic reserach. Its purpose is to support persons learning Spanish.
The main purpose is to learn the verb forms. & kverbos; selects one of the verbs and a time, the user enters the different forms of the verb and the program tells if the solutions are correct. Graphic is used to give a feedback to the user. The user can select the verbs and times that he wants to practice.
& kverbos; can be used to look up unknows verb forms, too.
Since KDE4 verbs can be trained in sentences, too. Also other grammar exercises with gaps are possible. The program comes without such exercises but it is possible to download such exercises. Look for information about installing exercises in chapter 5 and about creating exercises in chapter 4.
Working with & kverbos;
When you start & kverbos; you will see the menu window first. In the tree view you can select the exercise you want to do. A double click on a menu entry is one possibility to select and start an exercise. At the bottom of the window you have five round buttons to control the application.
The Menu-Windows of & kverbos;
Screenshot
Your first step using the program should be to select verbs and tenses. Use the Config button config-button to open the configuration dialogue. In the section verbs you can select verbs and in the section tenses the tenses you want to practice.
The fuction of the buttons in detail are:
The Config button which opens the configuration dialogue Configure & kverbos; Button
Opens the configure dialogue for & kverbos;. There you can select verbs, tenses, image files for the jigsaw feedback and KVTML files where the program looks for translations of verbs.
The Help button which gives access to some help options. The Help Button
First the button reveals three more buttons. One leads to the handbook, one offers short information about & kverbos; and the last general informaton about & kde; itself.
The Next button which starts the next step in the program Next Button
The Next Button has different functions. Let the mouse hover above the button and you will see what it actually does. It starts the next action in the program.
The Config button which opens the configuration dialogue Menu Button
When you are learning and you press the Menu-button you will be brought back to the menu.
The Config button which opens the configuration dialogue Quit Button
As the name tells you leave the program with this button.
The & kverbos; trainer windows
Depending on the selected exercise you will see different windows. There is a window where you can enter an infinitive of a verb and the program will show you how to conjugate the verb. Another type of exercise selects tense and infinitive and you enter the forms. Or you select a gap exercise. The last type of exercises does not come with the program. You have to install additonal files to get them.
The VerbViewTrainer - Look up verb forms
Have a look at the "VerbViewTrainer-" window. Here you can look up how to conjugate the verb that you have entered in the input line. Every infinitive you enter is counted as an exercise. If it exists in the programs database it is counted as a correct solution too.
The VerbViewTrainer Window
Screenshot VerbViewTrainer
The FormsTrainer
You have to be more active in the "FormsTrainer-" window. & kverbos; selects a verb and a tense. You have to enter the forms into the lineedit fields. After that you can use the Config button Next-button to correct your input. If some of your entered forms are not correct the colour is changed to red. You have a second chance to find the solution. If you have no idea you can go to the solution with the Config button Next-button. With this button you can cycle through the whole process: enter forms, correct the input, show the solution, go to the next verb.
The FormsTrainer Window
Screenshot FormsTrainer
The GapTrainer
Another type of trainer window is the "GapTrainer-". You can practice verb conjugation in sentences. Read the task, enter the forms into the gaps and use the Config button Next-button to go through the correction cycle.
You will not see this kind of trainer in a & kverbos; standard installation. To use this trainer you need additional exercise files. Have a look at the & kverbos; webpage to find such files. If exercise files are installed the program extends the menu with this exercises. For further information read the chapter for developers.

How to configure & kverbos;
Configure Dialogue: General
The General Configuration Window
Screenshot General Configuration
Show buttons for the Spanish characters ñ, á, é, í, ó, ú
Depending on the setup of your keyboard it might not be possible to enter the above mentioned characters. This option helps you. If it is selected, a line of button with the characters is shown below the trainer window. You can insert ñ, á, é, í, ó, ú with these buttons.
Use a verb selection instead the entire verb stock
As & kverbos; comes with over 9 000 verbs and you might not know all of them you can select verbs and practice this selection. With this option you decide if your selection is used or all the verbs.
Select verbs automatically if they are n't in the selection
Sometimes there are verbs in an exercise that you still did not select. This may happen in the VerbViewTrainer or the GapTrainer. If you have selected this option the program adds new verbs to your selection.
Ignore accent while checking the user input
Although it is clear that accents belong to correct spelling the user can check this option and the accents will be ignored during the correction process.
The use of the clock
On the left side of the trainer window there is a clock. It can be used in two ways. It simply counts the time that you are learning until all exercises are done or you finish your learning process or it works as a counter. That means you select a time and the clock counts backwards until this time has expired. So you can learn a fixed time.
Configure Dialogue: Tenses
The Tenses Configuration Window
Screenshot Tenses Configuration
Select Tenses
All the tenses you can learn are listed here. Select the ones you want to practice. This selection affects the FormsTrainer. It only uses tenses that you have selected.
Proportion
We talk of normal tense in this part if the tense is formed only by one word. Composed tenses have a form of haber or estar as the first part followed by the particip or a gerund. Because haber and estar are always conjugated the same way the composed tenses are considered easier and they should not ask as often as the normal tenses. You can set the proportion here.
Configure Dialogue: Verbs
The Verbs Configuration Window
Screenshot Verbs Configuration
You can see a tab-widget with three tabs that helps you to select and deselect the verbs you want to train.
First Tab: List of selected Verbs
All selected verbs are listed here. These verbs will be used for training. If this list is empty you cannot start studing and the program will give you a hint to select verbs.
Second Tab: Verbs in Grammatical groups
The known verbs grouped by different conjugation patterns. This helps you to select verbs of a special type, & eg; irregular verbs or changing verbs where'e 'becomes'ie' like'querer '(group verbs e -- > ie).
Third Tab: Verbs in Alphabetical Groups
As the name of the tabs says the verbs or sorted alphabetical.
We must n't forget the input line below the tab widget. Here you can enter a word or a part of word and the programs looks for infinitives that match your input.
You cannot add new verbs to the list or delete one from the list. You cannot edit the verbdata, too. If you encounter mistakes in the verb data, write an e-mail to the author.
Configure Dialogue: KVTML-Files
The KVTML-Files Configuration Window
Screenshot KVTML-Files Configuration
The verb database does n't contain any translations of the Spanish infinitives. If you like to work with translations into other languages you can use your favourtite KVTML-files containing the translations. You can add several files here. The program reads the files and searches for verbs and their translations.
List of KVTML-files to load
A list of files that you have already selected. You can add and delete files here. These files are used to search for translations.
Translated Verbs
Adjust how the translated words are used in & kverbos;.
Configure Dialogue: Jigsaw
The Jigsaw Configuration Window
You can decide if you want to make use of the jigsaw view. Its purpose is to give some motivation. Select images that are used as pictures for the jigsaw. You can also define how many pieces should be made.
Developer's Guide to & kverbos;
& kverbos; can be extended with gap exercises. This chapter informs you how to create exercises and how to install them.
Install exercise files
The exercise files can be installed for the whole system or for the user only.
Installation for the whole system
If you want to install exercises so that they are available for every user you have to put the files into the '$KDEDIR/ share/ kde4/ apps/ kverbos/ exercises/ 'folder
Installation for a user
If you install the exercise files into the folder '$HOME/. kde4/ share/ apps/ kverbos/ exercises/ 'only this user can see and use them. This way users can add additional exercises by themselves.
Create additional exercises
Every exercise consists of at least three files: 'exercisename. html ', 'exercisename. menu. en', 'exercisename. solution '.
The'exercisename. html 'file
This is the exercise itself as it will be presented to the & kverbos; user in the program.
The'exercisename. menu. en 'file
The file contains information used to extend the menu in the program. The menu will be extended, so that the user can select the exercise.
The'exercisename. solution 'file
This file contains the solution. It is used by the program to evaluate the user input.

& kverbos; is an application specially designed to study Spanish verbforms.

Kapp
verb
With & kverbos; the user can learn the forms of Spanish verbs. The program suggests a verb and a time and the user enters the different forms. The program corrects the user input an gives a feedback. The user can edit the list of the verbs that can be studied. The program can built regular verb forms by itself. Irregular verb forms have to be entered by the user. If a form of a verb is uncertain then the internet offers good sources: http: / /csgrs6k1. uwaterloo. ca/ ~dmg/ lando/ verbos/ con-jugador. html
The most interesting feature in the recent release is the use of & kfeeder;. This is a separate program that the user has to install separately if he wants to use it. If it is installed then the learning progress will be shown in the & kfeeder; application. A dog is running around and will be fed with bones if you are a good learner. Otherwise he will be lying around most of the time.
Here's a screenshot of & kverbos;
This window can be seen when the user starts the program.
When the user starts the program he can see this window. This is the main window of the application where the user can train verb forms. At the moment no verb file is loaded. So the program cannot suggest a verb. First the user has to open a file either with the menu File Open or with the menubar or he has to enter some verbs with Edit Enter new verb.
Here's a screenshot of & kverbos; with a loaded verb file
Here you see the main window with a loaded verb file.
Once the user has opened a file with verbs the program suggests one of them and a time. The user can type the solution into the textboxes.
This button wipes out all user input.
The user can test his input with this button. Incorrect forms will be underlined. Then the user has the chance to do it better and correct the forms another time. If one of the forms was n't correct the verb cannot be counted as correct anymore.
If the user wants to see the solution he can use show solution. Then the correct solution is displayed in the editboxes. If the user uses this button the verb cannot be counted as correct anymore.
The last button in this row can have two functions.
If the user presses this button and the verb forms have n't been corrected yet the button behaves like the'corregir 'button. The verb forms are corrected and the user can see if his input was correct. If the user wants to go on he has to press the button again.
If the button is pressed and the verbs already have been corrected the program goes on to the next verb. That means another verb is selected and presented to the user.
A second line of buttons allows the user enter special spanish characters which probably cannot be entered by keyboard.
In the status bar of the program the user gets information about his work. He can see how many verbs he has trained and how many of them have been correct. He can see how many verbs are stored in the opened file and which username has been entered, too.
The progress bar is another feedback for the user. He can see his correct answers as a percentage of trained verbs.

The New Verb Dialog
Here's a screenshot of the New Verb dialog
Here you can see the new verb dialog where the user can enter new verbs.
Use this dialog if you want to make your own verb list or if you want to append some new verbs to an existing verb list. Here you can enter the infinitive of the spanish verb and its meaning in a foreign language. Important is, that you tell the program if it is a regular verb or one of the spanish group verbs or an irregular one. If it is irregular you have to enter the irregular forms, too. Be careful with this dialog and the verb forms you enter because the program uses this data to generate forms automatically.
Some of the Edit boxes where you can enter the verb information. There are similar Edit Boxes for the gerund and participle form and all the other forms if needed.
With this Combo Box you select which type of verb you have entered. Do this carfully because it is important information for the program to do its work properly.
The Spanish language knows three types of regular conjugation. These are the conjugation pattern for the verbs ending on -er, -ar, and -ir. A lot of verbs are not regular in all forms but they are n't completely irregular. This verbs are called group verbs and can be divided in several groups. The program can generate the forms for the regular verbs and the ones for the group verbs itself. It only needs the information to which group the verb belongs. Other verbs are irregular and the irregular forms have to be entered. Select the group in the Combo Box.
regular
Chose this if it is a completely regular verb of one of the patterns -ar, -er or -ir.

You have entered some incorrect information and want to delete them. With this button you can wipe out the data in the Edit box of one single tab.
This buttons insert the displayed spanish characters to the Edit box that has the focus. Often these characters cannot be entered with the keyboard.
You want to wipe out all information in all Edit Boxes on all tabs. Then use this button.
Selects the verb before the actual verb in the verb list into the dialog. You can read an change the information for this verb. If the actual verb is the first one then the last one is loaded into the dialog.
Selects the verb behind the actual verb in the verb list into the dialog. You can read an change the information for this verb. If the actual verb is the last one then the first one is loaded.
Closes the dialog and returns to the main program or the Edit Verblist Dialog depending from where the dialog was opened.
The Edit Verblist Dialog
Here's a screenshot of the Edit Verblist dialog
Here you can see the Edit verblist dialog where the user can edit the list of the verbs.
In the list view of this dialog you can see all the verbs of the opened verb file. If there are n't any verbs in the file or if there is n't a file open the list view will be empty. You can select a verb from the list and edit this verb or you select and delete one of them.
This button deletes the selected verb from the list of verbs.
With this button you can leave the dialog. All changes that have been made until this moment will not affect the verb list of the main program. That means that the list of the main program will be unchanged.
The selected verb will be edited. The new verb dialog opens and the selected verb is loaded to the edit boxes. You can make your changes. If you make a double click on a verb this has the same effect than this button.
With this button you can close the dialog. The changes that have been made are stored in the verb list of the main program.
The Username Dialog
Here's a screenshot of the Username Dialog
Here you can see the Username Dialog where the user can enter his name.
Enter your name here. The name is set as the new username of the program. It will be displayed in the programs status bar. Use the OK Button to confirm your input. The Cancel button leaves the user name unchanged.
The program will store some information about your learning progress. The number of training sessions, the result of the last ten sessions and lists with the verbs that you entered right or wrong recently.
You can have a look at this information in the User Results dialog.
The User Result Dialog
Here's a screenshot of the User Result Dialog
Here you can see the User Result Dialog where the user can see his results.
In this dialog you can see the information that the program stores about you under your username. On the left you can see the results of the latest ten sessions and on the right are lists with the word that you entered right or wrong recently. A verb remains in the list of the right verbs for some time then it changes to the status unlearned again. The verbs that are in the wrong list will appear more frequently. They stay in the list until you enter them correctly. Then they will return to the list of the unlearned verbs.
The Settings Options Dialog
Here's a screenshot of the Settings Options Dialog
Here you can see the Settings Options Dialog where the user can change some options of the program.
In this dialog you can select the tenses that should be trained. So if you want to study a specific tense or if you have n't learned how to build the forms of a specific tense yet so you can select or deselect the tenses here. Your selection is stored to the properties file of the program.
You can select a correction mode too. If you select correct strictly then every missing accent is regarded as an error. You can make it easier with ignore accent then a missing accent is n't an error.
At last you can control the use of & kfeeder; if this application is installed. You can decide if the learning results will be shown with & kfeeder;, if the splash screen can be seen when the program is starting and what type of food animations are used. The last points needs a further explanation. & kfeeder; displays an animal that is running around. When you enter a correct solution your points will be send to & kfeeder;. The dog gets bones for each point. If you chose move food automatically then the bones move down from the ceiling and one point is one bone. Otherwise every point is only a move for a bone. So you will need more points until the dog can reach the bone. Really the option move food automatically is more interesting.
At the moment it is not possible to program any plugins for & kverbos;.
Until now nobody had a question that could be answered here.
& underFDL; & underGPL;
In order to successfully use & kverbos;, you need & kde; 3. x. x. The program is distributed without a verblist file. So you have to enter the verbs yourself or you can download a verbfile.
