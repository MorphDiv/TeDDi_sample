KDE Performance You can configure settings that improve KDE performance here.

Konqueror Performance You can configure several settings that improve Konqueror performance here. These include options for reusing already running instances and for keeping instances preloaded.
Disables the minimization of memory usage and allows you to make each browsing activity independent from the others
With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many file browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously.
If non-zero, this option allows keeping Konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed, up to the number specified in this option. When a new Konqueror instance is needed, one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead, improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances.
If enabled, an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary KDE startup sequence. This will make the first Konqueror window open faster, but at the expense of longer KDE startup times (but you will be able to work while it is loading, so you may not even notice that it is taking longer).
If enabled, KDE will always try to have one preloaded Konqueror instance ready; preloading a new instance in the background whenever there is not one available, so that windows will always open quickly. Warning: In some cases, it is actually possible that this will reduce perceived performance.
Minimize Memory Usage
& Never
For & file browsing only (recommended)
Always (use with care)
Preloading
Maximum number of instances kept & preloaded:
Preload an instance after KDE startup
Always try to have at least one preloaded instance
System Configuration
Disable & system configuration startup check
This option may in rare cases lead to various problems. Consult the What's This (Shift+F1) help for details.
During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration (mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs to be updated. This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications about missing required mimetypes, etc.). Changes of system configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing applications.
