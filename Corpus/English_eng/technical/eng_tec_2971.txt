ftp_nb_put() stores local_file on the FTP server, as remote_file.
The transfer mode specified must be either FTP_ASCII or FTP_BINARY.
The difference between this function and the ftp_put() is that this function uploads the file asynchronously, so your program can perform other operations while the file is being downloaded.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
Example 1. ftp_nb_put() example
/ / Initiate the Upload $ret = ftp_nb_put( $my_connection, "test.remote", "test.local", FTP_BINARY); while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {/ / Do whatever you want echo "."; / / Continue uploading... $ret = ftp_nb_continue ($my_connection);} if ($ret != FTP_FINISHED) {echo "There was an error uploading the file.. ."; exit(1);}
Example 2.
Resuming an upload with ftp_nb_put()
/ / Initiate $ret = ftp_nb_put ($my_connection, "test.remote", "test.local", FTP_BINARY, ftp_size("test.remote")); / / OR: $ret = ftp_nb_put ($my_connection, "test.remote", "test.local", / / FTP_BINARY, FTP_AUTORESUME); while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {/ / Do whatever you want echo "."; / / Continue uploading... $ret = ftp_nb_continue ($my_connection);} if ($ret != FTP_FINISHED) {echo "There was an error uploading the file.. ."; exit(1);}
