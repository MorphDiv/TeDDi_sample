(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
php_ini_scanned_files() returns a comma-separated list of configuration files parsed after php.ini.
These files are found in a directory defined by the --with-config-file-scan-dir. option which is set during compilation.
Returns a comma-separated string of .ini files on success.
If the directive --with-config-files-scan-dir wasn 't set, FALSE is returned.
If it was set and the directory was empty, an empty string is returned.
If a file is unreconizable, the file will still make it into the returned string but a PHP error will also result.
This PHP error will be seen both at compile time and while using php_ini_scanned_files().
The returned configuration files also include the path as declared in the --with-config-file-scan-dir directive.
Also, each comma is followed by a newline.
Example 1.
A simple example to list the returned ini files
?php if ($filelist = php_ini_scanned_files()) {if (strlen($filelist) 0) {$files = explode(' ,', $filelist); foreach ($files as $file) {echo "li". trim($file). "/ li \n";}}}?
