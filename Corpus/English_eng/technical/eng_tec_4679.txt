(PHP 3 CVS only)
Returns:
TRUE if the values are valid, and the settransaction() operation was successful, FALSE otherwise.
sesam_settransaction() overrides the default values for the "isolation level "and "read-only" transaction parameters (which are set in the SESAM configuration file), in order to optimize subsequent queries and guarantee database consistency.
The overridden values are used for the next transaction only.
sesam_settransaction() can only be called before starting a transaction, not after the transaction has been started already.
To simplify the use in php scripts, the following constants have been predefined in php (see SESAM handbook for detailed explanation of the semantics):
Table 1.
Valid values for "Isolation_Level" parameter
Value
Constant
Meaning
1
SESAM_TXISOL_READ_UNCOMMITTED
Read Uncommitted
2
SESAM_TXISOL_READ_COMMITTED
Read Committed
3
SESAM_TXISOL_REPEATABLE_READ
Repeatable Read
4
SESAM_TXISOL_SERIALIZABLE
Serializable
Table 2.
Valid values for "Read_Only" parameter
Value
Constant
Meaning
0
SESAM_TXREAD_READWRITE
Read / Write
1
SESAM_TXREAD_READONLY
Read-Only
The values set by sesam_settransaction() will override the default setting specified in the SESAM configuration file.
Example 1.
Setting SESAM transaction parameters
?php sesam_settransaction (SESAM_TXISOL_REPEATABLE_READ, SESAM_TXREAD_READONLY);?
