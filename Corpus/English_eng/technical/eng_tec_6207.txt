Plugins
& Netscape; Plugins
Currently, & konqueror; supports & Netscape; 4. x plugins.
Selecting Settings Configure Konqueror... Plugins will give you a dialog box with two tabbed pages; Scan and Plugins.
The Scan page controls how & kde; scans for new & Netscape; plugins, either manually by pressing the Scan for New Plugins button or automatically each time & kde; starts up.
The scan is done by looking through the folders listed in the Scan Folders list for. so files containing plugin code. It examines every such file to find out which MIME types the plugin supports. It then creates MIME type definitions for & kde; in the user's ~/. kde/ share/ mimelnk folder to make other applications aware of them.
The Plugins page shows you the & Netscape; plugins that & kde; has found, and for each plugin it lists the MIME types and the filename suffixes it uses to recognize them.
The dialog box also contains a checkbox Enable plugins globally which you can use to enable or disable plugins that can be contained in HTML pages (these can be considered a security risk).
