This section contains notes and hints specific to Netscape and iPlanet installs of PHP, both for Sun Solaris and Windows versions.
You can find more information about setting up PHP for the Netscape Enterprise Server here: http: / /benoit.noss.free.fr / php / install-php4.html
To build PHP with NES or iPlanet web servers, enter the proper install directory for the --with-nsapi = DIR To build PHP with NES or iPlanet web servers, enter the proper install directory for the --with-nsapi = DIR option.
The default directory is usually / opt / netscape / suitespot /.
Please also read / php-xxx-version / sapi / nsapi / nsapi-readme.txt.
Example 3-10.
Installation Example for Netscape Enterprise on Solaris
Instructions for Sun Solaris 2.6 with Netscape Enterprise Server 3.6 From: bhager@invacare.com 1.
Install the following packages from www.sunfreeware.com or another download site: flex-2_5_4a-sol26-sparc-local gcc-2_95_2-sol26-sparc-local gzip-1.2.4-sol26-sparc-local perl-5_005_03-sol26-sparc-local bison-1_25-sol26-sparc-local make-3_76_1-sol26-sparc-local m4-1_4-sol26-sparc-local autoconf-2.13 automake-1.4 mysql-3.23.24-beta (if you want mysql support) tar-1.13 (GNU tar) 2.
Make sure your path includes the proper directories PATH=.: / usr / local / bin: / usr / sbin: / usr / bin: / usr / ccs / bin export PATH 3. gunzip php-x.x.x.tar.gz (if you have a .gz dist, otherwise go to 4) 4. tar xvf php-x.x.x.tar 5. cd.. / php-x.x.x 6.
For the following step, make sure / opt / netscape / suitespot / is where your netscape server is installed.
Otherwise, change to correct path: / configure --with-mysql= / usr / local / mysql --with-nsapi= / opt / netscape / suitespot / --enable-track-vars --enable-libgcc 7. make 8. make install
Firstly you may need to add some paths to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment for Netscape to find all the shared libs.
This can best done in the start script for your Netscape server.
Windows users can probably skip this step.
The start script is often located in: / path / to / server / https-servername / start
You may also need to edit the configuration files that are located in: / path / to / server / https-servername / config /.
Example 3-11.
Configuration Example for Netscape Enterprise
Configuration Instructions for Netscape Enterprise Server From: bhager@invacare.com 1.
Add the following line to mime.types: type=magnus-internal / x-httpd-php exts=php 2.
Add the following to obj.conf, shlib will vary depending on your OS, for unix it will be something like / opt / netscape / suitespot / bin / libphp4.so.
You should place the following lines after mime types init.
Init fn=" load-modules "funcs="php4_init,php4_close,php4_execute,php4_auth_trans" shlib=" / php4 / nsapiPHP4.dll "Init fn=php4_init errorString="Failed to initialize PHP!" object name="default "... .#NOTE this next line should happen after all'ObjectType 'and before all'AddLog' lines Service fn="php4_execute" type="magnus-internal / x-httpd-php ".. / Object Object name="x-httpd-php" ObjectType fn="force-type "type="magnus-internal / x-httpd-php" Service fn=php4_execute / Object Authentication configuration PHP authentication cannot be used with any other authentication.
ALL AUTHENTICATION IS PASSED TO YOUR PHP SCRIPT.
To configure PHP Authentication for the entire server, add the following line:
Object name=" default "AuthTrans fn=php4_auth_trans.... / Object To use PHP Authentication on a single directory, add the following:
Object ppath=" d:\path o\authenticated\dir\* "AuthTrans fn=php4_auth_trans / Object
If you are running Netscape Enterprise 4.x, then you should use the following:
Example 3-12.
Configuration Example for Netscape Enterprise 4.x
Place these lines after the mime types init, and everything else is similar to the example configuration above.
From:
Graeme Hoose (GraemeHoose@BrightStation.com) Init fn="load-modules "shlib=" / path / to / server4 / bin / libphp4.so" funcs="php4_init,php4_close,php4_execute,php4_auth_trans "Init fn="php4_init" LateInit="yes "
To Install PHP as CGI (for Netscape Enterprise Server, iPlanet, perhaps Fastrack), do the following:
Copy php4ts.dll to your systemroot (the directory where you installed windows)
Make a file association from the command line.
Type the following two lines:
assoc .php=PHPScript ftype PHPScript=c:\php\php.exe %1 %*
In the Netscape Enterprise Administration Server create a dummy shellcgi directory and remove it just after (this step creates 5 important lines in obj.conf and allow the web server to handle shellcgi scripts).
In the Netscape Enterprise Administration Server create a new mime type (Category: type, Content-Type: magnus-internal / shellcgi, File Suffix:php).
Do it for each web server instance you want php to run
More details about setting up PHP as a CGI executable can be found here: http: / /benoit.noss.free.fr / php / install-php.html
To Install PHP as NSAPI (for Netscape Enterprise Server, iPlanet, perhaps Fastrack, do the following:
Copy php4ts.dll to your systemroot (the directory where you installed windows)
Make a file association from the command line.
Type the following two lines:
assoc .php=PHPScript ftype PHPScript=c:\php\php.exe %1 %*
In the Netscape Enterprise Administration Server create a new mime type (Category: type, Content-Type: magnus-internal / x-httpd-php, File Suffix:php).
Stop your web service and edit obj.conf.
At the end of the Init section, place these two lines (necessarily after mime type init!):
Init fn=" load-modules "funcs="php4_init,php4_close,php4_execute,php4_auth_trans" shlib="c: / php / sapi / php4nsapi.dll "Init fn="php4_init" errorString="Failed to initialise PHP! "
In The Object name=" default "section, place this line necessarily after all'ObjectType 'and before all'AddLog' lines:
Service fn=" php4_execute "type="magnus-internal / x-httpd-php"
At the end of the file, create a new object called x-httpd-php, by inserting these lines:
Object name=" x-httpd-php "ObjectType fn="force-type" type="magnus-internal / x-httpd-php "Service fn=php4_execute / Object
Restart your web service and apply changes
Do it for each web server instance you want PHP to run
