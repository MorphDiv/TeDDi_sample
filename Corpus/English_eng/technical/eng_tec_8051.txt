In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 7).
Twenty-four% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (Knodell 3/4).

* Any subject with an undetectable HCV-RNA level at the Follow-Up Week 12 visit and missing data at the Follow- Up Week 24 visit was considered a sustained responder.
Any subject with missing data in and after the Follow-Up Week 12 window was considered to be a non-responder at Week 24 of follow-up.

109 In a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50%.
Forty-one percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 4 and Week 24 of therapy.
In this subgroup, there was a 92% (89/97) sustained virological response rate.
The high sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and prospectively confirmed (n=48).
Limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 24 weeks of treatment).
Predictability of sustained virological response – Naïve patients Virological reponse by week 12, defined as a 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV- RNA has been shown to be predictive for sustained response (Table 8).

The negative predictive value for sustained response in patients treated with ViraferonPeg in monotherapy was 98%.
HCV/HIV Co-infected patients Two trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV.
The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 9.
Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months.
Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co- infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).
The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load < 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

Histological response Liver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in Study 1 and were available for 210 of the 412 subjects (51%).
Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among subjects treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
This decline was significant among responders (-0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among non-responders.
In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and none showed worsening.
There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study.
Steatosis was significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3.
ViraferonPeg/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
Failure to prior therapy was defined as relapse or non-response (HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment).
Patients who were HCV-RNA negative at Treatment Week 12 continued treatment for 48 weeks and were followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.
Response Week 12 was defined as undetectable HCV- RNA after 12 weeks of treatment.
Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) is defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (Table 10).

NR:
Non-responder defined as serum/plasma HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.
Plasma HCV-RNA is measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central laboratory * Intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.
112 Overall, approximately 36% (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 IU/ml).
In this subgroup, there was a 56% (463/823) sustained virological response rate.
For patients with prior failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at Week 12, the sustained response rates were 59% and 50%, respectively.
Among 480 patients with > 2 log viral reduction but detectable virus at Week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy.
In those patients the SVR was 12%.
Non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a Week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin (12.4% vs.
28.6%).
However, if a Week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in SVR regardless of prior treatment or prior response.
Long-Term efficacy data A large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin).
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes.
327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained responders relapsed during the study.
The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99% (95% CI:
98-100%).
SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical “cure” from chronic HCV.
However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
ViraferonPeg is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species.
The plasma half-life of ViraferonPeg is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b.
ViraferonPeg has a potential to depegylate to free interferon alfa-2b.
The biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
Following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.
ViraferonPeg Cmax and AUC measurements increase in a dose-related manner.
Mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.
Upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons.
There is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.
Mean (SD) ViraferonPeg elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg.
The mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully elucidated.
However, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30%) of ViraferonPeg apparent clearance.
Renal function:
Renal clearance appears to account for 30% of total clearance of ViraferonPeg.
In a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, Cmax, AUC, and half- life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.
Following multiple dosing of ViraferonPeg (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four weeks) the clearance of ViraferonPeg is reduced by a mean of 17% in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function.
Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis.
The dose of
113 ViraferonPeg for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).
Because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with ViraferonPeg (see section 4.2)
Hepatic function:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
Elderly patients ≥ 65 years of age:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age.
The data suggest that no alteration in ViraferonPeg dosage is necessary based on advancing age.
Patients under the age of 18 years:
Specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients.
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C only in patients 18 years of age or older.
Interferon neutralising factors:
Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received ViraferonPeg in the clinical trial.
Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon.
The clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who received ViraferonPeg 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
ViraferonPeg:
Adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys.
These studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.
Reproduction studies of ViraferonPeg have not been performed.
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
Effects on fertility have not been determined.
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation).
ViraferonPeg showed no genotoxic potential.
The relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from ViraferonPeg by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.
ViraferonPeg plus ribavirin:
When used in combination with ribavirin, ViraferonPeg did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone.
The major treatment-related change was a reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance alone.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV, including naïve patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection (see section 4.4).
The best way to use ViraferonPeg in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
This combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable HIV co- infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).
Interferon monotherapy, including ViraferonPeg, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.
Please refer also to the ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) when ViraferonPeg is to be used in combination with ribavirin.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis C.
Dose to be administered ViraferonPeg should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection.
The dose administered depends on whether it is used in combination with ribavirin or as monotherapy.
117 Combination therapy ViraferonPeg 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.
The intended dose of 1.5 μg/kg of ViraferonPeg to be used in combination with ribavirin may be delivered in weight categories with the pen/vial strengths according to Table 1.
Ribavirin capsules are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).

Duration of treatment – Naïve patients Predictability of sustained virological response:
Patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (see also section 5.1). • Genotype 1:
For patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).
In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
However, an overall 24 weeks treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). • Genotypes 2 or 3:
It is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for HCV/HIV co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. • Genotype 4:
In general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.
HCV/HIV Co-infection The recommended duration of dosing for HCV/HIV co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype.
Predictability of response and non-response in HCV/HIV Co-infection
Early virological response by Week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response.
The negative predictive value for sustained response in HCV/HIV co-infected patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was 99% (67/68; Study 1) (see section 5.1).
A positive predictive value of 50% (52/104; Study 1) was observed for HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.
118 Duration of treatment - Retreatment Predictability of sustained virological response:
All patients, irrespective of genotype, who have demonstrated serum HCV-RNA below the limits of detection at Week 12 should receive 48 weeks of therapy.
Retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).
Retreatment duration greater than 48 weeks in non-responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy As monotherapy the ViraferonPeg regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/k g/week.
The lowest vial or pen strength available is 50 μg/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 μg/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by volume as shown in Table 2.
For the 1.0 μg/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or alternate vial strengths can be used as shown in Table 2.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy was not studied in HCV/HIV co-infected patients.

Duration of treatment For patients who exhibit virological response at Week 12, treatment should be continued for at least another three-month period (i.e., a total of six months).
The decision to extend therapy to one year of treatment should be based on prognostic factors (e.g., genotype, age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis).
Dose modification for all patients If severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with ViraferonPeg monotherapy or ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, modify the dosages of each product as appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate.
As adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose should be kept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose.
Guidelines were developed in clinical trials for dose modification.

Special populations
Use in renal impairment:
Monotherapy:
ViraferonPeg should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
In patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of ViraferonPeg should be reduced by 25%.
Patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of ViraferonPeg reduced by 50%.
Data are not available for the use of ViraferonPeg in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2).
Patients with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored.
If renal function decreases during treatment, ViraferonPeg therapy should be discontinued.
Combination therapy:
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see ribavirin SPC).
When administered in combination with ribavirin, subjects with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.
Use in hepatic impairment:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, therefore ViraferonPeg must not be used for these patients.
Use in the elderly (≥ 65 years of age):
There are no apparent age -related effects on the pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg.
Data from elderly patients treated with a single dose of ViraferonPeg suggest no alteration in ViraferonPeg dose is necessary based on age (see section 5.2).
Use in patients under the age of 18 years:
There is no experience in children (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any interferon or to any of the excipients;
- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease
in the previous six months (see section 4.4); 121
- Severe, debilitating medical conditions;
- Autoimmune hepatitis or a history of autoimmune disease;
- Severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver;
- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment;
- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function;
- Initiation of ViraferonPeg is contraindicated in HCV/HIV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh
score ≥ 6.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Also see ribavirin Summary of the Product Characteristics (SPC) if ViraferonPeg is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Psychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS):
Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during ViraferonPeg therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period.
Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons.
Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders.
If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered.
If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with ViraferonPeg be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.
Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:
If treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.
More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications.
While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks.
Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of interferon alpha.
All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment.
Acute hypersensitivity:
Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy.
If such a reaction develops during treatment with ViraferonPeg, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical therapy immediately.
Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.
Cardiovascular system:
As with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving ViraferonPeg therapy require close monitoring.
It is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment.
Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of ViraferonPeg therapy.
Liver function:
As with all interferons, discontinue treatment with ViraferonPeg in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.
Fever:
While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.
122 Hydration:
Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing ViraferonPeg therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
Fluid replacement may be necessary.
Pulmonary changes:
Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients.
Any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken.
If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha.
Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.
Autoimmune disease:
The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons.
Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk.
Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Thyroid changes and 4.8).
Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon.
This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin.
If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).
Ocular changes:
Ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons (see section 4.8).
All patients should have a baseline eye examination.
Any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye examination.
Periodic visual examinations are recommended during ViraferonPeg therapy, particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
Discontinuation of ViraferonPeg should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.
Thyroid changes:
Infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Determine thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction.
In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, ViraferonPeg treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.
Metabolic disturbances:
Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed.
Monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis:
Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis.
Caution should be used when adding ViraferonPeg and ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC).
Hepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis:
Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death.
Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.
Other baseline factors in co-infected patients that may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and elevated bilirubin serum concentration.
Co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment.
Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.
123 Haematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and HAART may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients.
Although, the majority of them could be managed by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “Laboratory tests” and section 4.8).
Patients treated with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Patients with low CD4 counts:
In patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in subjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl.
Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of patients with low CD4 counts.
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Dental and periodontal disorders:
Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy.
In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long- term treatment with the combination of ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations.
In addition some patients may experience vomiting.
If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.
Organ transplant recipients:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied.
Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection.
Liver graft rejection has also been reported.
Other:
Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of ViraferonPeg in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.
Laboratory tests:
Standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy.
Acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a guideline prior to initiation of ViraferonPeg therapy are:
• • •
Platelets Neutrophil count TSH level
≥ 100,000/mm3 ≥ 1,500/mm3 must be within normal limits
Laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.
Important information about some of the ingredients of ViraferonPeg:
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially "sodium-free".
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase- isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
124 Results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing P450 substrates in chronic hepatitis C patients receiving once weekly ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9.
No change in activity of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, or N-acetyltransferase was observed.
Caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and flecainide (CYP2D6).
These findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation in patients undergoing treatment with ViraferonPeg.
Caution is therefore advised when ViraferonPeg treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.
No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between ViraferonPeg and ribavirin in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.
Methadone:
In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of ViraferonPeg subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 – 128%).
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression.
Especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Nucleoside analogs:
Use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis.
Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in vitro.
This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir).
Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended.
Reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin SPC).
Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.
The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4).
Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment (ART) regimen if this is already established.
This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
ViraferonPeg is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.
There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women..
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
The potential risk in humans is unknown.
ViraferonPeg is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus
Lactation:
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk.
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy.
Ribavirin therapy is
125 contraindicated in women who are pregnant.
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded.
Male patients and their female partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see Ribavirin SPC).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with ViraferonPeg are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and injection site reaction.
Additional important adverse reactions reported in more than 25% of subjects included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability and insomnia.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of therapy.
Fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur at a notably lower rate in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy compared to those treated with combination therapy (see Table 4).
The following treatment-related adverse reactions were reported during therapy with ViraferonPeg.
These reactions are listed in table 4 by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness

These adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to < 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy.
Most cases of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia were mild (WHO grades 1 or 2).
There were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (WHO grade 3:
39 of 186 [21%]; and WHO grade 4:
13 of 186 [7%]).
128 In a clinical trial, approximately 1.2% of patients treated with ViraferonPeg or interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment.
These events included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).
Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4).
Cardiomyopathy, that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease.
Ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).
A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4, Autoimmune disorders).
HCV/HIV co-infected patients For HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the larger studies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 lymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%), back pain (5%), blood amylase increased (6%), blood lactic acid increased (5%), cytolytic hepatitis (6%), lipase increased (6%) and pain in limb (6%).
Mitochondrial toxicity:
Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI regimen and associated ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).
Laboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
Although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Haematological abnormalities were more frequently reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin when compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin.
In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Anaemia (hemoglobin < 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
CD4 lymphocytes decrease:
Treatment with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage.
The decrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy.
The use of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up.
Limited safety data (N= 25) are available in co-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/µl (see section 4.4).
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
4.9 Overdose
129 Doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported.
The maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day.
In general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving ViraferonPeg are consistent with the known safety profile for ViraferonPeg; however, the severity of the events may be increased.
Standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not been shown to be useful.
No specific antidote for ViraferonPeg is available; therefore, symptomatic treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose.
If available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (PCC).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Immunostimulants, Cytokines and immunomodulators, Interferons, Peginterferon alfa-2b, ATC code:
L03A B10.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein.
The average molecular mass is approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.
Interferon alfa-2b In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of ViraferonPeg is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.
Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity.
However, certain monkey species, e.g., Rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.
Once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes.
It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus- infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.
Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic effects.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo.
Although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism.
This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.
ViraferonPeg ViraferonPeg pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts.
Subjects treated with ViraferonPeg showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature.
Following single doses of ViraferonPeg between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related manner.
Neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of ViraferonPeg.
ViraferonPeg clinical trials – Naïve patients Two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (C/I97-010) with ViraferonPeg monotherapy; the other (C/I98-580) with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (> 30 IU/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.
130 In the ViraferonPeg monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis C patients were treated with ViraferonPeg (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months.
In addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million International Units [MIU] three times a week) as a comparator.
This study showed that ViraferonPeg was superior to interferon alfa-2b (Table 5).
In the ViraferonPeg combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). • Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
In this trial, the combination of ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (Table 5), particularly in patients infected with Genotype 1 (Table 6).
Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.
HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
However, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin administered in combination with Viraferon Peg or interferon alfa-2b.
In those patients that received > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.

In the ViraferonPeg monotherapy study, the Quality of Life was generally less affected by 0.5 microgram/kg of ViraferonPeg than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of ViraferonPeg once weekly or 3 MIU of interferon alfa-2b three times a week.
In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 7).
Twenty-four% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (Knodell 3/4).

* Any subject with an undetectable HCV-RNA level at the Follow-Up Week 12 visit and missing data at the Follow- Up Week 24 visit was considered a sustained responder.
Any subject with missing data in and after the Follow-Up Week 12 window was considered to be a non-responder at Week 24 of follow-up.
The 6 month treatment duration in this trial was better tolerated than one year of treatment in the pivotal combination trial; for discontinuation 5% vs.
14%, for dose modification 18% vs.
49%.
In a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50%.
Forty-one percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 4 and Week 24 of therapy.
In this subgroup, there was a 92% (89/97) sustained virological response rate.
The high sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and prospectively confirmed (n=48).
Limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 24 weeks of treatment).
132 Predictability of sustained virological response – Naïve patients Virological reponse by week 12, defined as a 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV- RNA has been shown to be predictive for sustained response (Table 8).

HCV/HIV Co-infected patients Two trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV.
The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 9.
Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months.
Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co- infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).
The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load < 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

Histological response Liver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in Study 1 and were available for 210 of the 412 subjects (51%).
Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among subjects treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
This decline was significant among responders (-0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among non-responders.
In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and none showed worsening.
There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study.
Steatosis was significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3.
ViraferonPeg/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
Failure to prior therapy was defined as relapse or non-response (HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment).
Patients who were HCV-RNA negative at Treatment Week 12 continued treatment for 48 weeks and were followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.
Response Week 12 was defined as undetectable HCV- RNA after 12 weeks of treatment.
Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) is defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (Table 10).

NR:
Non-responder defined as serum/plasma HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.
Plasma HCV-RNA is measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central laboratory *Intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.
135 Overall, approximately 36% (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 IU/ml).
In this subgroup, there was a 56% (463/823) sustained virological response rate.
For patients with prior failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at Week 12, the sustained response rates were 59% and 50%, respectively.
Among 480 patients with > 2 log viral reduction but detectable virus at Week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy.
In those patients the SVR was 12%.
Non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a Week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin (12.4% vs.
28.6%).
However, if a Week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in SVR regardless of prior treatment or prior response.
Long-Term efficacy data A large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin).
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes.
327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained responders relapsed during the study.
The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99% (95% CI:
98-100%).
SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical “cure” from chronic HCV.
However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
ViraferonPeg is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species.
The plasma half-life of ViraferonPeg is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b.
ViraferonPeg has a potential to depegylate to free interferon alfa-2b.
The biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
Following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.
ViraferonPeg Cmax and AUC measurements increase in a dose-related manner.
Mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.
Upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons.
There is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.
Mean (SD) ViraferonPeg elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg.
The mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully elucidated.
However, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30%) of ViraferonPeg apparent clearance.
Renal function:
Renal clearance appears to account for 30% of total clearance of ViraferonPeg.
In a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, Cmax, AUC, and half- life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.
Following multiple dosing of ViraferonPeg (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four weeks) the clearance of ViraferonPeg is reduced by a mean of 17% in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function.
Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis.
The dose of
136 ViraferonPeg for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).
Because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with ViraferonPeg (see section 4.2)
Hepatic function:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
Elderly patients ≥ 65 years of age:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age.
The data suggest that no alteration in ViraferonPeg dosage is necessary based on advancing age.
Patients under the age of 18 years:
Specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients.
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C only in patients 18 years of age or older.
Interferon neutralising factors:
Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received ViraferonPeg in the clinical trial.
Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon.
The clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who received ViraferonPeg 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
ViraferonPeg:
Adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys.
These studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.
Reproduction studies of ViraferonPeg have not been performed.
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
Effects on fertility have not been determined.
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation).
ViraferonPeg showed no genotoxic potential.
The relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from ViraferonPeg by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.
ViraferonPeg plus ribavirin:
When used in combination with ribavirin, ViraferonPeg did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone.
The major treatment-related change was a reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance alone.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV, including naïve patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection (see section 4.4).
The best way to use ViraferonPeg in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
This combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable HIV co- infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).
Interferon monotherapy, including ViraferonPeg, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.
Please refer also to the ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) when ViraferonPeg is to be used in combination with ribavirin.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis C.
Dose to be administered ViraferonPeg should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection.
The dose administered depends on whether it is used in combination with ribavirin or as monotherapy.
140 Combination therapy ViraferonPeg 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.
The intended dose of 1.5 μg/kg of ViraferonPeg to be used in combination with ribavirin may be delivered in weight categories with the pen/vial strengths according to Table 1.
Ribavirin capsules are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).

Duration of treatment – Naïve patients Predictability of sustained virological response:
Patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (see also section 5.1). • Genotype 1:
For patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).
In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
However, an overall 24 weeks treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). • Genotypes 2 or 3:
It is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for HCV/HIV co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. • Genotype 4:
In general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.
HCV/HIV Co-infection The recommended duration of dosing for HCV/HIV co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype.
Predictability of response and non-response in HCV/HIV Co-infection
Early virological response by Week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response.
The negative predictive value for sustained response in HCV/HIV co-infected patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was 99% (67/68; Study 1) (see section 5.1).
A positive predictive value of 50% (52/104; Study 1) was observed for HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.
141 Duration of treatment - Retreatment Predictability of sustained virological response:
All patients, irrespective of genotype, who have demonstrated serum HCV-RNA below the limits of detection at Week 12 should receive 48 weeks of therapy.
Retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).
Retreatment duration greater than 48 weeks in non-responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy As monotherapy the ViraferonPeg regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/k g/week.
The lowest vial or pen strength available is 50 μg/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 μg/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by volume as shown in Table 2.
For the 1.0 μg/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or alternate vial strengths can be used as shown in Table 2.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy was not studied in HCV/HIV co-infected patients.

Duration of treatment For patients who exhibit virological response at Week 12, treatment should be continued for at least another three-month period (i.e., a total of six months).
The decision to extend therapy to one year of treatment should be based on prognostic factors (e.g., genotype, age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis).
Dose modification for all patients If severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with ViraferonPeg monotherapy or ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, modify the dosages of each product as appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate.
As adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose should be kept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose.
Guidelines were developed in clinical trials for dose modification.

Special populations
Use in renal impairment:
Monotherapy:
ViraferonPeg should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
In patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of ViraferonPeg should be reduced by 25%.
Patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of ViraferonPeg reduced by 50%.
Data are not available for the use of ViraferonPeg in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2).
Patients with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored.
If renal function decreases during treatment, ViraferonPeg therapy should be discontinued.
Combination therapy:
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see ribavirin SPC).
When administered in combination with ribavirin, subjects with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.
Use in hepatic impairment:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, therefore ViraferonPeg must not be used for these patients.
Use in the elderly (≥ 65 years of age):
There are no apparent age -related effects on the pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg.
Data from elderly patients treated with a s ingle dose of ViraferonPeg suggest no alteration in ViraferonPeg dose is necessary based on age (see section 5.2).
Use in patients under the age of 18 years:
There is no experience in children (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any interferon or to any of the excipients;
- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease
in the previous six months (see section 4.4); 144
- Severe, debilitating medical conditions;
- Autoimmune hepatitis or a history of autoimmune disease;
- Severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver;
- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment;
- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function;
- Initiation of ViraferonPeg is contraindicated in HCV/HIV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh
score ≥ 6.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Also see ribavirin Summary of the Product Characteristics (SPC) if ViraferonPeg is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Psychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS):
Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during ViraferonPeg therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period.
Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons.
Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders.
If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered.
If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with ViraferonPeg be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.
Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:
If treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.
More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications.
While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks.
Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of interferon alpha.
All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment.
Acute hypersensitivity:
Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy.
If such a reaction develops during treatment with ViraferonPeg, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical therapy immediately.
Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.
Cardiovascular system:
As with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving ViraferonPeg therapy require close monitoring.
It is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment.
Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of ViraferonPeg therapy.
Liver function:
As with all interferons, discontinue treatment with ViraferonPeg in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.
Fever:
While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.
145 Hydration:
Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing ViraferonPeg therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
Fluid replacement may be necessary.
Pulmonary changes:
Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients.
Any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken.
If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha.
Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.
Autoimmune disease:
The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons.
Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk.
Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Thyroid changes and 4.8).
Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon.
This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin.
If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).
Ocular changes:
Ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons (see section 4.8).
All patients should have a baseline eye examination.
Any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye examination.
Periodic visual examinations are recommended during ViraferonPeg therapy, particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
Discontinuation of ViraferonPeg should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.
Thyroid changes:
Infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Determine thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction.
In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, ViraferonPeg treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.
Metabolic disturbances:
Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed.
Monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis:
Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis.
Caution should be used when adding ViraferonPeg and ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC).
Hepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis:
Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death.
Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.
Other baseline factors in co-infected patients that may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and elevated bilirubin serum concentration.
Co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment.
Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.
146 Haematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and HAART may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients.
Although, the majority of them could be managed by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “Laboratory tests” and section 4.8).
Patients treated with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Patients with low CD4 counts:
In patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in subjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl.
Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of patients with low CD4 counts.
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Dental and periodontal disorders:
Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy.
In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long- term treatment with the combination of ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations.
In addition some patients may experience vomiting.
If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.
Organ transplant recipients:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied.
Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection.
Liver graft rejection has also been reported.
Other:
Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of ViraferonPeg in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.
Laboratory tests:
Standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy.
Acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a guideline prior to initiation of ViraferonPeg therapy are:
• • •
Platelets Neutrophil count TSH level
≥ 100,000/mm3 ≥ 1,500/mm3 must be within normal limits
Laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.
Important information about some of the ingredients of ViraferonPeg:
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially "sodium-free".
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase- isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
147 Results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing P450 substrates in chronic hepatitis C patients receiving once weekly ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9.
No change in activity of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, or N-acetyltransferase was observed.
Caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and flecainide (CYP2D6).
These findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation in patients undergoing treatment with ViraferonPeg.
Caution is therefore advised when ViraferonPeg treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.
No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between ViraferonPeg and ribavirin in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.
Methadone:
In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of ViraferonPeg subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 – 128%).
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression.
Especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Nucleoside analogs:
Use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis.
Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in vitro.
This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir).
Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended.
Reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin SPC).
Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.
The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4).
Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment (ART) regimen if this is already established.
This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
ViraferonPeg is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.
There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women..
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
The potential risk in humans is unknown.
ViraferonPeg is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus
Lactation:
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk.
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy.
Ribavirin therapy is
148 contraindicated in women who are pregnant.
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded.
Male patients and their female partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see Ribavirin SPC).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with ViraferonPeg are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and injection site reaction.
Additional important adverse reactions reported in more than 25% of subjects included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability and insomnia.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of therapy.
Fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur at a notably lower rate in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy compared to those treated with combination therapy (see Table 4).
The following treatment-related adverse reactions were reported during therapy with ViraferonPeg.
These reactions are listed in table 4 by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness

These adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to < 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy.
Most cases of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia were mild (WHO grades 1 or 2).
There were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (WHO grade 3:
39 of 186 [21%]; and WHO grade 4:
13 of 186 [7%]).
151 In a clinical trial, approximately 1.2% of patients treated with ViraferonPeg or interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment.
These events included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).
Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4).
Cardiomyopathy, that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease.
Ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).
A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4, Autoimmune disorders).
HCV/HIV co-infected patients For HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the larger studies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 lymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%), back pain (5%), blood amylase increased (6%), blood lactic acid increased (5%), cytolytic hepatitis (6%), lipase increased (6%) and pain in limb (6%).
Mitochondrial toxicity:
Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI regimen and associated ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).
Laboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
Although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Haematological abnormalities were more frequently reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin when compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin.
In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Anaemia (hemoglobin < 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
CD4 lymphocytes decrease:
Treatment with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage.
The decrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy.
The use of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up.
Limited safety data (N= 25) are available in co-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/µl (see section 4.4).
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
4.9 Overdose
Doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported.
The maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day.
In general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving ViraferonPeg are
152 consistent with the known safety profile for ViraferonPeg; however, the severity of the events may be increased.
Standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not been shown to be useful.
No specific antidote for ViraferonPeg is available; therefore, symptomatic treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose.
If available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (PCC).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Immunostimulants, Cytokines and immunomodulators, Interferons, Peginterferon alfa-2b, ATC code:
L03A B10.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein.
The average molecular mass is approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.
Interferon alfa-2b In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of ViraferonPeg is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.
Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity.
However, certain monkey species, e.g., Rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.
Once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes.
It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus- infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.
Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic effects.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo.
Although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism.
This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.
ViraferonPeg ViraferonPeg pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts.
Subjects treated with ViraferonPeg showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature.
Following single doses of ViraferonPeg between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related manner.
Neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of ViraferonPeg.
ViraferonPeg clinical trials – Naïve patients Two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (C/I97-010) with ViraferonPeg monotherapy; the other (C/I98-580) with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (> 30 IU/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.
153 In the ViraferonPeg monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis C patients were treated with ViraferonPeg (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months.
In addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million International Units [MIU] three times a week) as a comparator.
This study showed that ViraferonPeg was superior to interferon alfa-2b (Table 5).
In the ViraferonPeg combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). • Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
In this trial, the combination of ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (Table 5), particularly in patients infected with Genotype 1 (Table 6).
Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.
HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
However, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin administered in combination with Viraferon Peg or interferon alfa-2b.
In those patients that received > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.

In the ViraferonPeg monotherapy study, the Quality of Life was generally less affected by 0.5 microgram/kg of ViraferonPeg than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of ViraferonPeg once weekly or 3 MIU of interferon alfa-2b three times a week.
In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose, which has not yet been validated) (Table 7).
Twenty-four% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (Knodell 3/4).

* Any subject with an undetectable HCV-RNA level at the Follow-Up Week 12 visit and missing data at the Follow- Up Week 24 visit was considered a sustained responder.
Any subject with missing data in and after the Follow-Up Week 12 window was considered to be a non-responder at Week 24 of follow-up.
The 6 month treatment duration in this trial was better tolerated than one year of treatment in the pivotal combination trial; for discontinuation 5% vs.
14%, for dose modification 18% vs.
49%.
In a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50%.
Forty-one percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 4 and Week 24 of therapy.
In this subgroup, there was a 92% (89/97) sustained virological response rate.
The high sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and prospectively confirmed (n=48).
Limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 24 weeks of treatment).
155 Predictability of sustained virological response – Naïve patients Virological reponse by week 12, defined as a 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV- RNA has been shown to be predictive for sustained response (Table 8).

HCV/HIV Co-infected patients Two trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV.
The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 9.
Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months.
Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co- infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).
The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load < 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

Histological response Liver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in Study 1 and were available for 210 of the 412 subjects (51%).
Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among subjects treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
This decline was significant among responders (-0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among non-responders.
In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and none showed worsening.
There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study.
Steatosis was significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3.
ViraferonPeg/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
Failure to prior therapy was defined as relapse or non-response (HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment).
Patients who were HCV-RNA negative at Treatment Week 12 continued treatment for 48 weeks and were followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.
Response Week 12 was defined as undetectable HCV- RNA after 12 weeks of treatment.
Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) is defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (Table 10).

NR:
Non-responder defined as serum/plasma HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.
Plasma HCV-RNA is measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central laboratory *Intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.
158 Overall, approximately 36% (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 IU/ml).
In this subgroup, there was a 56% (463/823) sustained virological response rate.
For patients with prior failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at Week 12, the sustained response rates were 59% and 50%, respectively.
Among 480 patients with > 2 log viral reduction but detectable virus at Week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy.
In those patients the SVR was 12%.
Non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a Week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin (12.4% vs.
28.6%).
However, if a Week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in SVR regardless of prior treatment or prior response.
Long-Term efficacy data A large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin).
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes.
327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained responders relapsed during the study.
The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99% (95% CI:
98-100%).
SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical “cure” from chronic HCV.
However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
ViraferonPeg is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species.
The plasma half-life of ViraferonPeg is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b.
ViraferonPeg has a potential to depegylate to free interferon alfa-2b.
The biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
Following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.
ViraferonPeg Cmax and AUC measurements increase in a dose-related manner.
Mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.
Upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons.
There is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.
Mean (SD) ViraferonPeg elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg.
The mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully elucidated.
However, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30%) of ViraferonPeg apparent clearance.
Renal function:
Renal clearance appears to account for 30% of total clearance of ViraferonPeg.
In a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, Cmax, AUC, and half- life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.
Following multiple dosing of ViraferonPeg (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four weeks) the clearance of ViraferonPeg is reduced by a mean of 17% in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function.
Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis.
The dose of
159 ViraferonPeg for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).
Because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with ViraferonPeg (see section 4.2)
Hepatic function:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
Elderly patients ≥ 65 years of age:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age.
The data suggest that no alteration in ViraferonPeg dosage is necessary based on advancing age.
Patients under the age of 18 years:
Specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients.
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C only in patients 18 years of age or older.
Interferon neutralising factors:
Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received ViraferonPeg in the clinical trial.
Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon.
The clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who received ViraferonPeg 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
ViraferonPeg:
Adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys.
These studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.
Reproduction studies of ViraferonPeg have not been performed.
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
Effects on fertility have not been determined.
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation).
ViraferonPeg showed no genotoxic potential.
The relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from ViraferonPeg by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.
ViraferonPeg plus ribavirin:
When used in combination with ribavirin, ViraferonPeg did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone.
The major treatment-related change was a reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance alone.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV, including naïve patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection (see section 4.4).
The best way to use ViraferonPeg in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
This combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable HIV co- infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).
Interferon monotherapy, including ViraferonPeg, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.
Please refer also to the ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) when ViraferonPeg is to be used in combination with ribavirin.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis C.
Dose to be administered ViraferonPeg should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection.
The dose administered depends on whether it is used in combination with ribavirin or as monotherapy.
163 Combination therapy ViraferonPeg 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.
The intended dose of 1.5 μg/kg of ViraferonPeg to be used in combination with ribavirin may be delivered in weight categories with the pen/vial strengths according to Table 1.
Ribavirin capsules are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).

Duration of treatment – Naïve patients Predictability of sustained virological response:
Patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (see also section 5.1). • Genotype 1:
For patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).
In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
However, an overall 24 weeks treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). • Genotypes 2 or 3:
It is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for HCV/HIV co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. • Genotype 4:
In general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.
HCV/HIV Co-infection The recommended duration of dosing for HCV/HIV co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype.
Predictability of response and non-response in HCV/HIV Co-infection
Early virological response by Week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response.
The negative predictive value for sustained response in HCV/HIV co-infected patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was 99% (67/68; Study 1) (see section 5.1).
A positive predictive value of 50% (52/104; Study 1) was observed for HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.
164 Duration of treatment - Retreatment Predictability of sustained virological response:
All patients, irrespective of genotype, who have demonstrated serum HCV-RNA below the limits of detection at Week 12 should receive 48 weeks of therapy.
Retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).
Retreatment duration greater than 48 weeks in non-responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy As monotherapy the ViraferonPeg regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg/week.
The lowest vial or pen strength available is 50 μg/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 μg/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by volume as shown in Table 2.
For the 1.0 μg/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or alternate vial strengths can be used as shown in Table 2.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy was not studied in HCV/HIV co-infected patients.

Minimum delivery for pen is 0.3 ml. ** For patients > 120 kg, use 80 μg/0.5 ml vial
Duration of treatment For patients who exhibit virological response at Week 12, treatment should be continued for at least another three-month period (i.e., a total of six months).
The decision to extend therapy to one year of treatment should be based on prognostic factors (e.g., genotype, age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis).
Dose modification for all patients If severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with ViraferonPeg monotherapy or ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, modify the dosages of each product as appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate.
As adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose should be kept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose.
Guidelines were developed in clinical trials for dose modification.

Special populations
Use in renal impairment:
Monotherapy:
ViraferonPeg should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
In patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of ViraferonPeg should be reduced by 25%.
Patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of ViraferonPeg reduced by 50%.
Data are not available for the use of ViraferonPeg in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2).
Patients with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored.
If renal function decreases during treatment, ViraferonPeg therapy should be discontinued.
Combination therapy:
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see ribavirin SPC).
When administered in combination with ribavirin, subjects with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.
Use in hepatic impairment:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, therefore ViraferonPeg must not be used for these patients.
Use in the elderly (≥ 65 years of age):
There are no apparent age-related effects on the pharmacok inetics of ViraferonPeg.
Data from elderly patients treated with a single dose of ViraferonPeg suggest no alteration in ViraferonPeg dose is necessary based on age (see section 5.2).
Use in patients under the age of 18 years:
There is no experience in children (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any interferon or to any of the excipients;
- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease
in the previous six months (see section 4.4); 167
- Severe, debilitating medical conditions;
- Autoimmune hepatitis or a history of autoimmune disease;
- Severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver;
- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment;
- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function;
- Initiation of ViraferonPeg is contraindicated in HCV/HIV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh
score ≥ 6.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Also see ribavirin Summary of the Product Characteristics (SPC) if ViraferonPeg is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Psychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS):
Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during ViraferonPeg therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period.
Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons.
Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders.
If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered.
If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with ViraferonPeg be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.
Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:
If treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.
More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications.
While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks.
Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of interferon alpha.
All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment.
Acute hypersensitivity:
Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy.
If such a reaction develops during treatment with ViraferonPeg, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical therapy immediately.
Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.
Cardiovascular system:
As with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving ViraferonPeg therapy require close monitoring.
It is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment.
Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of ViraferonPeg therapy.
Liver function:
As with all interferons, discontinue treatment with ViraferonPeg in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.
Fever:
While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.
168 Hydration:
Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing ViraferonPeg therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
Fluid replacement may be necessary.
Pulmonary changes:
Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients.
Any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken.
If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha.
Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.
Autoimmune disease:
The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons.
Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk.
Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Thyroid changes and 4.8).
Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon.
This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin.
If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).
Ocular changes:
Ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons (see section 4.8).
All patients should have a baseline eye examination.
Any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye examination.
Periodic visual examinations are recommended during ViraferonPeg therapy, particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
Discontinuation of ViraferonPeg should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.
Thyroid changes:
Infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Determine thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction.
In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, ViraferonPeg treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.
Metabolic disturbances:
Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed.
Monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis:
Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis.
Caution should be used when adding ViraferonPeg and ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC).
Hepatic decompensation in HCV/ HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis:
Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death.
Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.
Other baseline factors in co-infected patients that may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and elevated bilirubin serum concentration.
Co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment.
Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.
169 Haematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and HAART may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients.
Although, the majority of them could be managed by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “Laboratory tests” and section 4.8).
Patients treated with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Patients with low CD4 counts:
In patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in subjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl.
Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of patients with low CD4 counts.
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Dental and periodontal disorders:
Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy.
In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long- term treatment with the combination of ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations.
In addition some patients may experience vomiting.
If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.
Organ transplant recipients:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied.
Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection.
Liver graft rejection has also been reported.
Other:
Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of ViraferonPeg in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.
Laboratory tests:
Standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy.
Acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a guideline prior to initiation of ViraferonPeg therapy are:
• • •
Platelets Neutrophil count TSH level
≥ 100,000/mm3 ≥ 1,500/mm3 must be within normal limits
Laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.
Important information about some of the ingredients of ViraferonPeg:
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially "sodium-free".
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase- isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
170 Results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing P450 substrates in chronic hepatitis C patients receiving once weekly ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9.
No change in activity of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, or N-acetyltransferase was observed.
Caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and flecainide (CYP2D6).
These findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation in patients undergoing treatment with ViraferonPeg.
Caution is therefore advised when ViraferonPeg treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.
No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between ViraferonPeg and ribavirin in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.
Methadone:
In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of ViraferonPeg subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 – 128%).
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression.
Especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Nucleoside analogs:
Use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis.
Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in vitro.
This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir).
Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended.
Reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin SPC).
Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.
The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4).
Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment (ART) regimen if this is already established.
This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
ViraferonPeg is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.
There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women..
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
The potential risk in humans is unknown.
ViraferonPeg is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus
Lactation:
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk.
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy.
Ribavirin therapy is
171 contraindicated in women who are pregnant.
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded.
Male patients and their female partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see Ribavirin SPC).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with ViraferonPeg are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and injection site reaction.
Additional important adverse reactions reported in more than 25% of subjects included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability and insomnia.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of therapy.
Fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur at a notably lower rate in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy compared to those treated with combination therapy (see Table 4).
The following treatment-related adverse reactions were reported during therapy with ViraferonPeg.
These reactions are listed in table 4 by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness

These adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to < 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy.
Most cases of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia were mild (WHO grades 1 or 2).
There were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (WHO grade 3:
39 of 186 [21%]; and WHO grade 4:
13 of 186 [7%]).
174 In a clinical trial, approximately 1.2% of patients treated with ViraferonPeg or interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment.
These events included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).
Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4).
Cardiomyopathy, that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease.
Ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).
A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4, Autoimmune disorders).
HCV/HIV co-infected patients For HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the larger studies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 lymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%), back pain (5%), blood amylase increased (6%), blood lactic acid increased (5%), cytolytic hepatitis (6%), lipase increased (6%) and pain in limb (6%).
Mitochondrial toxicity:
Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI regimen and associated ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).
Laboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
Although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and aaemia occurred more frequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Haematological abnormalities were more frequently reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin when compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin.
In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Anaemia (hemoglobin < 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
CD4 lymphocytes decrease:
Treatment with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage.
The decrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy.
The use of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up.
Limited safety data (N= 25) are available in co-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/µl (see section 4.4).
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
4.9 Overdose
175 Doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported.
The maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day.
In general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving ViraferonPeg are consistent with the known safety profile for ViraferonPeg; however, the severity of the events may be increased.
Standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not been shown to be useful.
No specific antidote for ViraferonPeg is available; therefore, symptomatic treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose.
If available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (PCC).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Immunostimulants, Cytokines and immunomodulators, Interferons, Peginterferon alfa-2b, ATC code:
L03A B10.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein.
The average molecular mass is approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.
Interferon alfa-2b In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of ViraferonPeg is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.
Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity.
However, certain monkey species, e.g., Rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.
Once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes.
It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus- infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.
Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic effects.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo.
Although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism.
This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.
ViraferonPeg ViraferonPeg pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts.
Subjects treated with ViraferonPeg showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature.
Following single doses of ViraferonPeg between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related manner.
Neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of ViraferonPeg.
ViraferonPeg clinical trials – Naïve patients Two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (C/I97-010) with ViraferonPeg monotherapy; the other (C/I98-580) with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (> 30 IU/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.
176 In the ViraferonPeg monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis C patients were treated with ViraferonPeg (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months.
In addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million International Units [MIU] three times a week) as a comparator.
This study showed that ViraferonPeg was superior to interferon alfa-2b (Table 5).
In the ViraferonPeg combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). • Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
In this trial, the combination of Viraferon Peg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (Table 5), particularly in patients infected with Genotype 1 (Table 6).
Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.
HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
However, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin administered in combination with ViraferonPeg or interferon alfa-2b.
In those patients that received > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.

In the ViraferonPeg monotherapy study, the Quality of Life was generally less affected by 0.5 microgram/kg of ViraferonPeg than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of ViraferonPeg once weekly or 3 MIU of interferon alfa-2b three times a week.
In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 7).
Twenty-four% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (Knodell 3/4).

* Any subject with an undetectable HCV-RNA level at the Follow-Up Week 12 visit and missing data at the Follow- Up Week 24 visit was considered a sustained responder.
Any subject with missing data in and after the Follow-Up Week 12 window was considered to be a non-responder at Week 24 of follow-up.

49%.
In a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50%.
Forty-one percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 4 and Week 24 of therapy.
In this subgroup, there was a 92% (89/97) sustained virological response rate.
The high sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and prospectively confirmed (n=48).
Limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 24 weeks of treatment).
178 Predictability of sustained virological response – Naïve patients Virological reponse by week 12, defined as a 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV- RNA has been shown to be predictive for sustained response (Table 8).

HCV/HIV Co-infected patients Two trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV.
The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 9.
Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months.
Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co- infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).
The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load < 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

Histological response Liver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in Study 1 and were available for 210 of the 412 subjects (51%).
Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among subjects treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
This decline was significant among responders (-0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among non-responders.
In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and none showed worsening.
There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study.
Steatosis was significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3.
ViraferonPeg/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
Failure to prior therapy was defined as relapse or non-response (HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment).
Patients who were HCV-RNA negative at Treatment Week 12 continued treatment for 48 weeks and were followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.
Response Week 12 was defined as undetectable HCV- RNA after 12 weeks of treatment.
Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) is defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (Table 10).

Non-responder defined as serum/plasma HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.
Plasma HCV-RNA is measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central laboratory *Intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.
181 Overall, approximately 36% (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 IU/ml).
In this subgroup, there was a 56% (463/823) sustained virological response rate.
For patients with prior failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at Week 12, the sustained response rates were 59% and 50%, respectively.
Among 480 patients with > 2 log viral reduction but detectable virus at Week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy.
In those patients the SVR was 12%.
Non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a Week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin (12.4% vs.
28.6%).
However, if a Week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in SVR regardless of prior treatment or prior response.
Long-Term efficacy data A large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin).
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes.
327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained responders relapsed during the study.
The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99% (95% CI:
98-100%).
SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical “cure” from chronic HCV.
However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
ViraferonPeg is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species.
The plasma half-life of ViraferonPeg is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b.
ViraferonPeg has a potential to depegylate to free interferon alfa-2b.
The biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
Following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.
ViraferonPeg Cmax and AUC measurements increase in a dose-related manner.
Mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.
Upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons.
There is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.
Mean (SD) ViraferonPeg elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg.
The mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully elucidated.
However, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30%) of ViraferonPeg apparent clearance.
Renal function:
Renal clearance appears to account for 30% of total clearance of ViraferonPeg.
In a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, Cmax, AUC, and half- life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.
Following multiple dosing of ViraferonPeg (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four weeks) the clearance of ViraferonPeg is reduced by a mean of 17% in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function.
Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis.
The dose of
182 ViraferonPeg for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).
Because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with ViraferonPeg (see section 4.2)
Hepatic function:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
Elderly patients ≥ 65 years of age:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age.
The data suggest that no alteration in ViraferonPeg dosage is necessary based on advancing age.
Patients under the age of 18 years:
Specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients.
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C only in patients 18 years of age or older.
Interferon neutralising factors:
Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received ViraferonPeg in the clinical trial.
Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon.
The clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who received ViraferonPeg 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
ViraferonPeg:
Adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys.
These studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.
Reproduction studies of ViraferonPeg have not been performed.
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
Effects on fertility have not been determined.
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation).
ViraferonPeg showed no genotoxic potential.
The relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from ViraferonPeg by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.
ViraferonPeg plus ribavirin:
When used in combination with ribavirin, ViraferonPeg did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone.
The major treatment-related change was a reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance alone.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV, including naïve patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection (see section 4.4).
The best way to use ViraferonPeg in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
This combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable HIV co- infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).
Interferon monotherapy, including ViraferonPeg, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.
Please refer also to the ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) when ViraferonPeg is to be used in combination with ribavirin.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis C.
Dose to be administered ViraferonPeg should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection.
The dose administered depends on whether it is used in combination with ribavirin or as monotherapy.
186 Combination therapy ViraferonPeg 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.
The intended dose of 1.5 μg/kg of ViraferonPeg to be used in combination with ribavirin may be delivered in weight categories with the pen/vial strengths according to Table 1.
Ribavirin capsules are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).

Duration of treatment – Naïve patients Predictability of sustained virological response:
Patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (see also section 5.1). • Genotype 1:
For patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).
In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who become HCV-RN A negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
However, an overall 24 weeks treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). • Genotypes 2 or 3:
It is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for HCV/HIV co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. • Genotype 4:
In general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.
HCV/HIV Co-infection The recommended duration of dosing for HCV/HIV co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype.
Predictability of response and non-response in HCV/HIV Co-infection
Early virological response by Week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response.
The negative predictive value for sustained response in HCV/HIV co-infected patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was 99% (67/68; Study 1) (see section 5.1).
A positive predictive value of 50% (52/104; Study 1) was observed for HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.
187 Duration of treatment - Retreatment Predictability of sustained virological response:
All patients, irrespective of genotype, who have demonstrated serum HCV-RNA below the limits of detection at Week 12 should receive 48 weeks of therapy.
Retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).
Retreatment duration greater than 48 weeks in non-responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy As monotherapy the ViraferonPeg regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg/week.
The lowest vial or pen strength available is 50 μg/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 μg/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by volume as shown in Table 2.
For the 1.0 μg/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or alternate vial strengths can be used as shown in Table 2.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy was not studied in HCV/HIV co-infected patients.

Duration of treatment For patients who exhibit virological response at Week 12, treatment should be continued for at least another three-month period (i.e., a total of six months).
The decision to extend therapy to one year of treatment should be based on prognostic factors (e.g., genotype, age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis).
Dose modification for all patients If severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with ViraferonPeg monotherapy or ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, modify the dosages of each product as appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate.
As adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose should be kept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose.
Guidelines were developed in clinical trials for dose modification.

Special populations
Use in renal impairment:
Monotherapy:
ViraferonPeg should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
In patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of ViraferonPeg should be reduced by 25%.
Patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of ViraferonPeg reduced by 50%.
Data are not available for the use of ViraferonPeg in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2).
Patients with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored.
If renal function decreases during treatment, ViraferonPeg therapy should be discontinued.
Combination therapy:
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see ribavirin SPC).
When administered in combination with ribavirin, subjects with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.
Use in hepatic impairment:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, therefore ViraferonPeg must not be used for these patients.
Use in the elderly (≥ 65 years of age):
There are no apparent age -related effects on the pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg.
Data from elderly patients treated with a single dose of ViraferonPeg suggest no alteration in ViraferonPeg dose is necessary based on age (see section 5.2).
Use in patients under the age of 18 years:
There is no experience in children (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any interferon or to any of the excipients;
- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease
in the previous six months (see section 4.4); 190
- Severe, debilitating medical conditions;
- Autoimmune hepatitis or a history of autoimmune disease;
- Severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver;
- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment;
- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function;
- Initiation of ViraferonPeg is contraindicated in HCV/HIV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh
score ≥ 6.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Also see ribavirin Summary of the Product Characteristics (SPC) if ViraferonPeg is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Psychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS):
Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during ViraferonPeg therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period.
Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons.
Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders.
If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered.
If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with ViraferonPeg be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.
Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:
If treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.
More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications.
While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks.
Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of interferon alpha.
All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment.
Acute hypersensitivity:
Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy.
If such a reaction develops during treatment with ViraferonPeg, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical therapy immediately.
Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.
Cardiovascular system:
As with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving ViraferonPeg therapy require close monitoring.
It is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment.
Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of ViraferonPeg therapy.
Liver function:
As with all interferons, discontinue treatment with ViraferonPeg in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.
Fever:
While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.
191 Hydration:
Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing ViraferonPeg therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
Fluid replacement may be necessary.
Pulmonary changes:
Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients.
Any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken.
If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha.
Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.
Autoimmune disease:
The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons.
Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk.
Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Thyroid changes and 4.8).
Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon.
This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin.
If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).
Ocular changes:
Ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons (see section 4.8).
All patients should have a baseline eye examination.
Any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye examination.
Periodic visual examinations are recommended during ViraferonPeg therapy, particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
Discontinuation of ViraferonPeg should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.
Thyroid changes:
Infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Determine thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction.
In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, ViraferonPeg treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.
Metabolic disturbances:
Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed.
Monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis:
Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis.
Caution should be used when adding ViraferonPeg and ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC).
Hepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis:
Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death.
Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.
Other baseline factors in co-infected patients that may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and elevated bilirubin serum concentration.
Co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment.
Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.
192 Haematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and HAART may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients.
Although, the majority of them could be managed by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “Laboratory tests” and section 4.8).
Patients treated with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Patients with low CD4 counts:
In patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in subjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl.
Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of patients with low CD4 counts.
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Dental and periodontal disorders:
Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy.
In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long- term treatment with the combination of ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations.
In addition some patients may experience vomiting.
If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.
Organ transplant recipients:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied.
Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection.
Liver graft rejection has also been reported.
Other:
Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of ViraferonPeg in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.
Laboratory tests:
Standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy.
Acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a guideline prior to initiation of ViraferonPeg therapy are:
• • •
Platelets Neutrophil count TSH level
≥ 100,000/mm3 ≥ 1,500/mm3 must be within normal limits
Laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.
Important information about some of the ingredients of ViraferonPeg:
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially "sodium-free".
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase- isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
193 Results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing P450 substrates in chronic hepatitis C patients receiving once weekly ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9.
No change in activity of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, or N-acetyltransferase was observed.
Caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and flecainide (CYP2D6).
These findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation in patients undergoing treatment with ViraferonPeg.
Caution is therefore advised when ViraferonPeg treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.
No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between ViraferonPeg and ribavirin in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.
Methadone:
In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of ViraferonPeg subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 – 128%).
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression.
Especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Nucleoside analogs:
Use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis.
Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in vitro.
This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir).
Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended.
Reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin SPC).
Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.
The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4).
Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment (ART) regimen if this is already established.
This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
ViraferonPeg is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.
There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women..
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
The potential risk in humans is unknown.
ViraferonPeg is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus
Lactation:
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk.
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding should be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy.
Ribavirin therapy is
194 contraindicated in women who are pregnant.
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded.
Male patients and their female partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see Ribavirin SPC).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with ViraferonPeg are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and injection site reaction.
Additional important adverse reactions reported in more than 25% of subjects included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability and insomnia.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of therapy.
Fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur at a notably lower rate in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy compared to those treated with combination therapy (see Table 4).
The following treatment-related adverse reactions were reported during therapy with ViraferonPeg.
These reactions are listed in table 4 by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness

These adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to < 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy.
Most cases of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia were mild (WHO grades 1 or 2).
There were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (WHO grade 3:
39 of 186 [21%]; and WHO grade 4:
13 of 186 [7%]).
197 In a clinical trial, approximately 1.2% of patients treated with ViraferonPeg or interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment.
These events included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).
Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4).
Cardiomyopathy, that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease.
Ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).
A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4, Autoimmune disorders).
HCV/HIV co-infected patients For HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the larger studies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 lymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%), back pain (5%), blood amylase increased (6%), blood lactic acid increased (5%), cytolytic hepatitis (6%), lipase increased (6%) and pain in limb (6%).
Mitochondrial toxicity:
Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI regimen and associated ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).
Laboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
Although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Haematological abnormalities were more frequently reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin when compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin.
In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Anaemia (hemoglobin < 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
CD4 lymphocytes decrease:
Treatment with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage.
The decrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy.
The use of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up.
Limited safety data (N= 25) are available in co-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/µl (see section 4.4).
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
4.9 Overdose
198 Doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported.
The maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day.
In general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving ViraferonPeg are consistent with the known safety profile for ViraferonPeg; however, the severity of the events may be increased.
Standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not been shown to be useful.
No specific antidote for ViraferonPeg is available; therefore, symptomatic treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose.
If available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (PCC).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Immunostimulants, Cytokines and immunomodulators, Interferons, Peginterferon alfa-2b, ATC code:
L03A B10.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein.
The average molecular mass is approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.
Interferon alfa-2b In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of ViraferonPeg is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.
Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity.
However, certain monkey species, e.g., Rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.
Once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes.
It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus- infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.
Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic effects.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo.
Although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism.
This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.
ViraferonPeg ViraferonPeg pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts.
Subjects treated with ViraferonPeg showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature.
Following single doses of ViraferonPeg between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related manner.
Neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of ViraferonPeg.
ViraferonPeg clinical trials – Naïve patients Two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (C/I97-010) with ViraferonPeg monotherapy; the other (C/I98-580) with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (> 30 IU/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.
199 In the ViraferonPeg monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis C patients were treated with ViraferonPeg (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months.
In addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million International Units [MIU] three times a week) as a comparator.
This study showed that ViraferonPeg was superior to interferon alfa-2b (Table 5).
In the Viraferon Peg combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). • Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
In this trial, the combination of Viraferon Peg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (Table 5), particularly in patients infected with Genotype 1 (Table 6).
Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.
HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
However, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin administered in combination with Viraferon Peg or interferon alfa-2b.
In those patients that received > 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (800 mg dose in typical 75 kg patient), regardless of genotype or viral load, response rates were significantly higher than in those patients that received ≤ 10.6 mg/kg ribavirin (Table 6), while response rates in patients that received > 13.2 mg/kg ribavirin were even higher.

In the ViraferonPeg monotherapy study, the Quality of Life was generally less affected by 0.5 microgram/kg of ViraferonPeg than by either 1.0 microgram/kg of ViraferonPeg once weekly or 3 MIU of interferon alfa-2b three times a week.
In a separate trial, 224 patients with genotype 2 or 3 received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with ribavirin 800 mg –1,400 mg p.o. for 6 months (based on body weight, only three patients weighing > 105 kg, received the 1,400 mg dose) (Table 7).
Twenty-four% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (Knodell 3/4).

* Any subject with an undetectable HCV-RNA level at the Follow-Up Week 12 visit and missing data at the Follow- Up Week 24 visit was considered a sustained responder.
Any subject with missing data in and after the Follow-Up Week 12 window was considered to be a non-responder at Week 24 of follow-up.
The 6 month treatment duration in this trial was better tolerated than one year of treatment in the pivotal combination trial; for discontinuation 5% vs.
14%, for dose modification 18% vs.
49%.
In a non-comparative trial, 235 patients with genotype 1 and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) received ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
The overall sustained response rate after a 24-week treatment duration was 50%.
Forty-one percent of subjects (97/235) had nondetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 4 and Week 24 of therapy.
In this subgroup, there was a 92% (89/97) sustained virological response rate.
The high sustained response rate in this subgroup of patients was identified in an interim analysis (n=49) and prospectively confirmed (n=48).
Limited historical data indicate that treatment for 48 weeks might be associated with a higher sustained response rate (11/11) and with a lower risk of relapse (0/11 as compared to 7/96 following 24 weeks of treatment).
201 Predictability of sustained virological response – Naïve patients Virological reponse by week 12, defined as a 2-log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV- RNA has been shown to be predictive for sustained response (Table 8).

HCV/HIV Co-infected patients Two trials have been conducted in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV.
The response to treatment in both of these trials is presented in Table 9.
Study 1 (RIBAVIC; P01017) was a randomized, multicentre study which enrolled 412 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co-infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months.
Study 2 (P02080) was a randomized, single centre study that enrolled 95 previously untreated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who were co- infected with HIV.
Patients were randomized to receive either ViraferonPeg (100 or 150 µg /week based on weight) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight) or interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU TIW) plus ribavirin (800-1,200 mg/day based on weight).
The duration of therapy was 48 weeks with a follow-up period of 6 months except for patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3 and viral load < 800,000 IU/ml (Amplicor) who were treated for 24 weeks with a 6-month follow-up period.

Histological response Liver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in Study 1 and were available for 210 of the 412 subjects (51%).
Both the Metavir score and Ishak grade decreased among subjects treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
This decline was significant among responders (-0.3 for Metavir and -1.2 for Ishak) and stable (-0.1 for Metavir and -0.2 for Ishak) among non-responders.
In terms of activity, about one-third of sustained responders showed improvement and none showed worsening.
There was no improvement in terms of fibrosis observed in this study.
Steatosis was significantly improved in patients infected with HCV Genotype 3.
ViraferonPeg/ribavirin retreatment of prior treatment failures In a non-comparative trial, 2,293 patients with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon/ribavirin were retreated with ViraferonPeg, 1.5 microgram/kg subcutaneously, once weekly, in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin.
Failure to prior therapy was defined as relapse or non-response (HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment).
Patients who were HCV-RNA negative at Treatment Week 12 continued treatment for 48 weeks and were followed for 24 weeks post-treatment.
Response Week 12 was defined as undetectable HCV- RNA after 12 weeks of treatment.
Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) is defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks post-treatment (Table 10).

NR:
Non-responder defined as serum/plasma HCV-RNA positive at the end of a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment.
Plasma HCV-RNA is measured with a research-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central laboratory *Intent to treat population includes 7 patients for whom at least 12 weeks of prior therapy could not be confirmed.
204 Overall, approximately 36% (821/2,286) of patients had undetectable plasma HCV-RNA levels at Week 12 of therapy measured using a research-based test (limit of detection 125 IU/ml).
In this subgroup, there was a 56% (463/823) sustained virological response rate.
For patients with prior failure on therapy with nonpegylated interferon or pegylated interferon and negative at Week 12, the sustained response rates were 59% and 50%, respectively.
Among 480 patients with > 2 log viral reduction but detectable virus at Week 12, altogether 188 patients continued therapy.
In those patients the SVR was 12%.
Non-responders to prior therapy with pegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin were less likely to achieve a Week 12 response to retreatment than non-responders to nonpegylated interferon alpha/ribavirin (12.4% vs.
28.6%).
However, if a Week 12 response was achieved, there was little difference in SVR regardless of prior treatment or prior response.
Long-Term efficacy data A large long-term follow-up study enrolled 567 patients after treatment in a prior study with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin).
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the durability of sustained virologic response (SVR) and assess the impact of continued viral negativity on clinical outcomes.
327 patients completed at least 5 years of long-term follow-up and only 3 out of 366 sustained responders relapsed during the study.
The Kaplan-Meier estimate for continued sustained response over 5 years for all patients is 99% (95% CI:
98-100%).
SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with ViraferonPeg (with or without ribavirin) results in long-term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical “cure” from chronic HCV.
However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
ViraferonPeg is a well characterized polyethylene glycol-modified (“pegylated”) derivative of interferon alfa-2b and is predominantly composed of monopegylated species.
The plasma half-life of ViraferonPeg is prolonged compared with non-pegylated interferon alfa-2b.
ViraferonPeg has a potential to depegylate to free interferon alfa-2b.
The biologic activity of the pegylated isomers is qualitatively similar, but weaker than free interferon alfa-2b.
Following subcutaneous administration, maximal serum concentrations occur between 15-44 hours post-dose, and are sustained for up to 48-72 hours post-dose.
ViraferonPeg Cmax and AUC measurements increase in a dose-related manner.
Mean apparent volume of distribution is 0.99 l/kg.
Upon multiple dosing, there is an accumulation of immunoreactive interferons.
There is, however, only a modest increase in biologic activity as measured by a bioassay.
Mean (SD) ViraferonPeg elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours (13.3 hours), with apparent clearance of 22.0 ml/hr·kg.
The mechanisms involved in clearance of interferons in man have not yet been fully elucidated.
However, renal elimination may account for a minority (approximately 30%) of ViraferonPeg apparent clearance.
Renal function:
Renal clearance appears to account for 30% of total clearance of ViraferonPeg.
In a single dose study (1.0 microgram/kg) in patients with impaired renal function, Cmax, AUC, and half- life increased in relation to the degree of renal impairment.
Following multiple dosing of ViraferonPeg (1.0 microgram/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four weeks) the clearance of ViraferonPeg is reduced by a mean of 17% in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function.
Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis.
The dose of
205 ViraferonPeg for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see section 4.3).
Because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with ViraferonPeg (see section 4.2)
Hepatic function:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
Elderly patients ≥ 65 years of age:
The pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg following a single subcutaneous dose of 1.0 microgram/kg were not affected by age.
The data suggest that no alteration in ViraferonPeg dosage is necessary based on advancing age.
Patients under the age of 18 years:
Specific pharmacokinetic evaluations have not been performed on these patients.
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C only in patients 18 years of age or older.
Interferon neutralising factors:
Interferon neutralising factor assays were performed on serum samples of patients who received ViraferonPeg in the clinical trial.
Interferon neutralising factors are antibodies which neutralise the antiviral activity of interferon.
The clinical incidence of neutralising factors in patients who received ViraferonPeg 0.5 micrograms/kg is 1.1%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
ViraferonPeg:
Adverse events not observed in clinical trials were not seen in toxicity studies in monkeys.
These studies were limited to four weeks due to the appearance of anti-interferon antibodies in most monkeys.
Reproduction studies of ViraferonPeg have not been performed.
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be an abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
Effects on fertility have not been determined.
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted into experimental animal or human milk (see section 4.6 for relevant human data on pregnancy and lactation).
ViraferonPeg showed no genotoxic potential.
The relative non-toxicity of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), which is liberated from ViraferonPeg by metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in preclinical acute and subchronic toxicity studies in rodents and monkeys, standard embryo-foetal development studies and in in vitro mutagenicity assays.
ViraferonPeg plus ribavirin:
When used in combination with ribavirin, ViraferonPeg did not cause any effects not previously seen with either active substance alone.
The major treatment-related change was a reversible, mild to moderate anaemia, the severity of which was greater than that produced by either active substance alone.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ViraferonPeg is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum HCV-RNA or anti-HCV, including naïve patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection (see section 4.4).
The best way to use ViraferonPeg in this indication is in combination with ribavirin.
This combination is indicated in naïve patients including patients with clinically stable HIV co- infection and in patients who have failed previous treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy (see section 5.1).
Interferon monotherapy, including ViraferonPeg, is indicated mainly in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.
Please refer also to the ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) when ViraferonPeg is to be used in combination with ribavirin.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated and monitored only by a physician experienced in the management of patients with hepatitis C.
Dose to be administered ViraferonPeg should be administered as a once weekly subcutaneous injection.
The dose administered depends on whether it is used in combination with ribavirin or as monotherapy.
209 Combination therapy ViraferonPeg 1.5 micrograms/kg/week in combination with ribavirin capsules.
The intended dose of 1.5 μg/kg of ViraferonPeg to be used in combination with ribavirin may be delivered in weight categories with the pen/vial strengths according to Table 1.
Ribavirin capsules are to be administered orally each day in two divided doses with food (morning and evening).

Duration of treatment – Naïve patients Predictability of sustained virological response:
Patients infected with virus genotype 1 who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (see also section 5.1). • Genotype 1:
For patients who exhibit virological response at week 12, treatment should be continued for another nine month period (i.e., a total of 48 weeks).
In the subset of patients with genotype 1 infection and low viral load (< 600,000 IU/ml) who become HCV-RNA negative at treatment week 4 and remain HCV-RNA negative at week 24, the treatment could either be stopped after this 24 week treatment course or pursued for an additional 24 weeks (i.e. overall 48 weeks treatment duration).
However, an overall 24 weeks treatment duration may be associated with a higher risk of relapse than a 48 weeks treatment duration (see section 5.1). • Genotypes 2 or 3:
It is recommended that all patients be treated for 24 weeks, except for HCV/HIV co-infected patients who should receive 48 weeks of treatment. • Genotype 4:
In general, patients infected with genotype 4 are considered harder to treat and limited study data (n=66) indicate they are compatible with a duration of treatment as for genotype 1.
HCV/HIV Co-infection The recommended duration of dosing for HCV/HIV co-infected patients is 48 weeks, regardless of genotype.
Predictability of response and non-response in HCV/HIV Co-infection
Early virological response by Week 12, defined as a 2 log viral load decrease or undetectable levels of HCV-RNA, has been shown to be predictive for sustained response.
The negative predictive value for sustained response in HCV/HIV co-infected patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was 99% (67/68; Study 1) (see section 5.1).
A positive predictive value of 50% (52/104; Study 1) was observed for HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving combination therapy.
210 Duration of treatment - Retreatment Predictability of sustained virological response:
All patients, irrespective of genotype, who have demonstrated serum HCV-RNA below the limits of detection at Week 12 should receive 48 weeks of therapy.
Retreated patients who fail to achieve virological response at Week 12 are unlikely to become sustained virological responders after 48 weeks of therapy (see also section 5.1).
Retreatment duration greater than 48 weeks in non-responder patients with genotype 1 has not been studied with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin combination therapy.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy As monotherapy the ViraferonPeg regimen is 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg/week.
The lowest vial or pen strength available is 50 μg/0.5 ml; therefore for patients prescribed 0.5 μg/kg/week, doses must be adjusted by volume as shown in Table 2.
For the 1.0 μg/kg dose, similar volume adjustments can be made or alternate vial strengths can be used as shown in Table 2.
ViraferonPeg monotherapy was not studied in HCV/HIV co-infected patients.

Duration of treatment For patients who exhibit virological response at Week 12, treatment should be continued for at least another three-month period (i.e., a total of six months).
The decision to extend therapy to one year of treatment should be based on prognostic factors (e.g., genotype, age > 40 years, male gender, bridging fibrosis).
Dose modification for all patients If severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during treatment with ViraferonPeg monotherapy or ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, modify the dosages of each product as appropriate, until the adverse reactions abate.
As adherence might be of importance for outcome of therapy, the dose should be kept as close as possible to the recommended standard dose.
Guidelines were developed in clinical trials for dose modification.

Special populations
Use in renal impairment:
Monotherapy:
ViraferonPeg should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
In patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of ViraferonPeg should be reduced by 25%.
Patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of ViraferonPeg reduced by 50%.
Data are not available for the use of ViraferonPeg in patients with creatinine clearance < 15 ml/minute (see section 5.2).
Patients with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored.
If renal function decreases during treatment, ViraferonPeg therapy should be discontinued.
Combination therapy:
Patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/minute must not be treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (see ribavirin SPC).
When administered in combination with ribavirin, subjects with impaired renal function should be more carefully monitored with respect to the development of anaemia.
Use in hepatic impairment:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg therapy has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, therefore ViraferonPeg must not be used for these patients.
Use in the elderly (≥ 65 years of age):
There are no apparent age -related effects on the pharmacokinetics of ViraferonPeg.
Data from elderly patients treated with a single dose of ViraferonPeg suggest no alteration in ViraferonPeg dose is necessary based on age (see section 5.2).
Use in patients under the age of 18 years:
There is no experience in children (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any interferon or to any of the excipients;
- A history of severe pre-existing cardiac disease, including unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease
in the previous six months (see section 4.4); 213
- Severe, debilitating medical conditions;
- Autoimmune hepatitis or a history of autoimmune disease;
- Severe hepatic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis of the liver;
- Pre-existing thyroid disease unless it can be controlled with conventional treatment;
- Epilepsy and/or compromised central nervous system (CNS) function;
- Initiation of ViraferonPeg is contraindicated in HCV/HIV patients with cirrhosis and a Child-Pugh
score ≥ 6.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Also see ribavirin Summary of the Product Characteristics (SPC) if ViraferonPeg is to be administered in combination with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Psychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS):
Severe CNS effects, particularly depression, suicidal ideation and attempted suicide have been observed in some patients during ViraferonPeg therapy, and even after treatment discontinuation mainly during the 6-month follow-up period.
Other CNS effects including aggressive behaviour (sometimes directed against others), bipolar disorders, mania, confusion and alterations of mental status have been observed with alpha interferons.
Patients should be closely monitored for any signs or symptoms of psychiatric disorders.
If such symptoms appear, the potential seriousness of these undesirable effects must be borne in mind by the prescribing physician and the need for adequate therapeutic management should be considered.
If psychiatric symptoms persist or worsen, or suicidal ideation is identified, it is recommended that treatment with ViraferonPeg be discontinued, and the patient followed, with psychiatric intervention as appropriate.
Patients with existence of, or history of severe psychiatric conditions:
If treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b is judged necessary in patients with existence or history of severe psychiatric conditions, this should only be initiated after having ensured appropriate individualised diagnostic and therapeutic management of the psychiatric condition.
More significant obtundation and coma, including cases of encephalopathy, have been observed in some patients, usually elderly, treated at higher doses for oncology indications.
While these effects are generally reversible, in a few patients full resolution took up to three weeks.
Very rarely, seizures have occurred with high doses of interferon alpha.
All patients in the chronic hepatitis C studies had a liver biopsy before inclusion, but in certain cases (i.e. patients with genotype 2 and 3), treatment may be possible without histological confirmation.
Current treatment guidelines should be consulted as to whether a liver biopsy is needed prior to commencing treatment.
Acute hypersensitivity:
Acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, anaphylaxis) have been observed rarely during interferon alfa-2b therapy.
If such a reaction develops during treatment with ViraferonPeg, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate medical therapy immediately.
Transient rashes do not necessitate interruption of treatment.
Cardiovascular system:
As with interferon alfa-2b, patients with a history of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and/or previous or current arrhythmic disorders, receiving ViraferonPeg therapy require close monitoring.
It is recommended that patients who have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities have electrocardiograms taken prior to and during the course of treatment.
Cardiac arrhythmias (primarily supraventricular) usually respond to conventional therapy but may require discontinuation of ViraferonPeg therapy.
Liver function:
As with all interferons, discontinue treatment with ViraferonPeg in patients who develop prolongation of coagulation markers which might indicate liver decompensation.
Fever:
While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome reported commonly during interferon therapy, other causes of persistent fever must be ruled out.
214 Hydration:
Adequate hydration must be maintained in patients undergoing ViraferonPeg therapy since hypotension related to fluid depletion has been seen in some patients treated with alpha interferons.
Fluid replacement may be necessary.
Pulmonary changes:
Pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonitis, and pneumonia, occasionally resulting in fatality, have been observed rarely in interferon alpha treated patients.
Any patient developing fever, cough, dyspnea or other respiratory symptoms must have a chest X-ray taken.
If the chest X-ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary function impairment, the patient is to be monitored closely, and, if appropriate, discontinue interferon alpha.
Prompt discontinuation of interferon alpha administration and treatment with corticosteroids appear to be associated with resolution of pulmonary adverse events.
Autoimmune disease:
The development of auto-antibodies and autoimmune disorders has been reported during treatment with alpha interferons.
Patients predisposed to the development of autoimmune disorders may be at increased risk.
Patients with signs or symptoms compatible with autoimmune disorders should be evaluated carefully, and the benefit-risk of continued interferon therapy should be reassessed (see also section 4.4 Thyroid changes and 4.8).
Cases of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon.
This syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes, auditory system, meninges, and skin.
If VKH syndrome is suspected, antiviral treatment should be withdrawn and corticosteroid therapy discussed (see section 4.8).
Ocular changes:
Ophthalmologic disorders, including retinal haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and retinal artery or vein obstruction have been reported in rare instances after treatment with alpha interferons (see section 4.8).
All patients should have a baseline eye examination.
Any patient complaining of ocular symptoms, including loss of visual acuity or visual field must have a prompt and complete eye examination.
Periodic visual examinations are recommended during ViraferonPeg therapy, particularly in patients with disorders that may be associated with retinopathy, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
Discontinuation of ViraferonPeg should be considered in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmological disorders.
Thyroid changes:
Infrequently, patients treated for chronic hepatitis C with interferon alpha have developed thyroid abnormalities, either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
Determine thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels if, during the course of therapy, a patient develops symptoms consistent with possible thyroid dysfunction.
In the presence of thyroid dysfunction, ViraferonPeg treatment may be continued if TSH levels can be maintained in the normal range by medication.
Metabolic disturbances:
Hypertriglyceridemia and aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia, sometimes severe, have been observed.
Monitoring of lipid levels is, therefore, recommended.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis:
Patients co-infected with HIV and receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) may be at increased risk of developing lactic acidosis.
Caution should be used when adding ViraferonPeg and ribavirin to HAART therapy (see ribavirin SPC).
Hepatic decompensation in HCV/HIV co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis:
Co-infected patients with advanced cirrhosis receiving HAART may be at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and death.
Adding treatment with alfa interferons alone or in combination with ribavirin may increase the risk in this patient subset.
Other baseline factors in co-infected patients that may be associated with a higher risk of hepatic decompensation include treatment with didanosine and elevated bilirubin serum concentration.
Co-infected patients receiving both antiretroviral (ARV) and anti-hepatitis treatment should be closely monitored, assessing their Child-Pugh score during treatment.
Patients progressing to hepatic decompensation should have their anti-hepatitis treatment immediately discontinued and the ARV treatment reassessed.
215 Haematological abnormalities in HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin treatment and HAART may be at increased risk to develop haematological abnormalities (as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) compared to HCV mono-infected patients.
Although, the majority of them could be managed by dose reduction, close monitoring of haematological parameters should be undertaken in this population of patients (see section 4.2 and below “Laboratory tests” and section 4.8).
Patients treated with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine are at increased risk of developing anaemia and therefore the concomitant use of this combination with zidovudine is not recommended (see section 4.5).
Patients with low CD4 counts:
In patients co-infected with HCV/HIV, limited efficacy and safety data (N = 25) are available in subjects with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/µl.
Caution is therefore warranted in the treatment of patients with low CD4 counts.
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Dental and periodontal disorders:
Dental and periodontal disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy.
In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long- term treatment with the combination of ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
Patients should brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations.
In addition some patients may experience vomiting.
If this reaction occurs, they should be advised to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards.
Organ transplant recipients:
The safety and efficacy of ViraferonPeg alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied.
Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection.
Liver graft rejection has also been reported.
Other:
Due to reports of interferon alpha exacerbating pre-existing psoriatic disease and sarcoidosis, use of ViraferonPeg in patients with psoriasis or sarcoidosis is recommended only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.
Laboratory tests:
Standard haematologic tests, blood chemistry and a test of thyroid function must be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy.
Acceptable baseline values that may be considered as a guideline prior to initiation of ViraferonPeg therapy are:
• • •
Platelets Neutrophil count TSH level
≥ 100,000/mm3 ≥ 1,500/mm3 must be within normal limits
Laboratory evaluations are to be conducted at weeks 2 and 4 of therapy, and periodically thereafter as clinically appropriate.
Important information about some of the ingredients of ViraferonPeg:
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially "sodium-free".
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose malabsorption or sucrase- isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
216 Results from a multiple-dose probe study assessing P450 substrates in chronic hepatitis C patients receiving once weekly ViraferonPeg (1.5 µg/kg) for 4 weeks demonstrated an increase in activity of CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9.
No change in activity of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, or N-acetyltransferase was observed.
Caution should be used when administering peginterferon alfa-2b with medicines metabolised by CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9, especially those with narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and flecainide (CYP2D6).
These findings may partly relate to improved metabolic capacity due to reduced hepatic inflammation in patients undergoing treatment with ViraferonPeg.
Caution is therefore advised when ViraferonPeg treatment is initiated for chronic hepatitis in patients treated with medication with a narrow therapeutic window and sensitive to mild metabolic impairment of the liver.
No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between ViraferonPeg and ribavirin in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study.
Methadone:
In patients with chronic hepatitis C that were on stable methadone maintenance therapy and naïve to peginterferon alfa-2b, addition of 1.5 microgram/kg/week of ViraferonPeg subcutaneously for 4 weeks increased R-methadone AUC by approximately 15% (95% Cl for AUC ratio estimate 103 – 128%).
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased sedative effect, as well as respiratory depression.
Especially in patients on a high dose of methadone, the risk for QTc prolongation should be considered.
HCV/HIV Co-infection Nucleoside analogs:
Use of nucleoside analogs, alone or in combination with other nucleosides, has resulted in lactic acidosis.
Pharmacologically, ribavirin increases phosphorylated metabolites of purine nucleosides in vitro.
This activity could potentiate the risk of lactic acidosis induced by purine nucleoside analogs (e.g. didanosine or abacavir).
Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine is not recommended.
Reports of mitochondrial toxicity, in particular lactic acidosis and pancreatitis, of which some fatal, have been reported (see ribavirin SPC).
Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV, although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.
The concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended due to an increased risk of anaemia (see section 4.4).
Consideration should be given to replacing zidovudine in a combination anti-retroviral treatment (ART) regimen if this is already established.
This would be particularly important in patients with a known history of zidovudine-induced anaemia.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
ViraferonPeg is recommended for use in fertile women only when they are using effective contraception during the treatment.
There are no adequate data from the use of interferon alfa-2b in pregnant women..
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to be abortifacient in primates.
ViraferonPeg is likely to also cause this effect.
The potential risk in humans is unknown.
ViraferonPeg is to be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus
Lactation:
It is not known whether the components of this medicinal product are excreted in human milk.
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in breast-fed infants, Page:
217 breast-feeding should be discontinued prior to initiation of treatment.
Combination therapy with ribavirin:
Ribavirin causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy.
Ribavirin therapy is
217 contraindicated in women who are pregnant.
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients or in partners of male patients taking ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Females of childbearing potential and their partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 4 months after treatment has been concluded.
Male patients and their female partners must each use an effective contraceptive during treatment and for 7 months after treatment has been concluded (see Ribavirin SPC).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients who develop fatigue, somnolence or confusion during treatment with ViraferonPeg are cautioned to avoid driving or operating machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most common treatment-related adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, seen in more than half of the study subjects, were headache, fatigue, and injection site reaction.
Additional important adverse reactions reported in more than 25% of subjects included myalgia, fever, asthenia, alopecia, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, depression, irritability and insomnia.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were manageable without the need for modification of doses or discontinuation of therapy.
Fatigue, alopecia, pruritus, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, irritability and insomnia occur at a notably lower rate in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy compared to those treated with combination therapy (see Table 4).
The following treatment-related adverse reactions were reported during therapy with ViraferonPeg.
These reactions are listed in table 4 by system organ class and frequency (very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or not known.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness

These adverse reactions were common (≥1/100 to < 1/10) in clinical trials in patients treated with ViraferonPeg monotherapy.
Most cases of neutropaenia and thrombocytopaenia were mild (WHO grades 1 or 2).
There were some cases of more severe neutropenia in patients treated with the recommended doses of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin (WHO grade 3:
39 of 186 [21%]; and WHO grade 4:
13 of 186 [7%]).
220 In a clinical trial, approximately 1.2% of patients treated with ViraferonPeg or interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin reported life-threatening psychiatric events during treatment.
These events included suicidal ideation and attempted suicide (see section 4.4).
Cardiovascular (CVS) adverse events, particularly arrhythmia, appeared to be correlated mostly with pre-existing CVS disease and prior therapy with cardiotoxic agents (see section 4.4).
Cardiomyopathy, that may be reversible upon discontinuation of interferon alpha, has been reported rarely in patients without prior evidence of cardiac disease.
Ophthalmological disorders that have been reported rarely with alpha interferons include retinopathies (including macular oedema), retinal haemorrhages, retinal artery or vein obstruction, cotton wool spots, loss of visual acuity or visual field, optic neuritis, and papilloedema (see section 4.4).
A wide variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders have been reported with alpha interferons including thyroid disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (new or aggravated), idiopathic and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, vasculitis, neuropathies including mononeuropathies and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (see also section 4.4, Autoimmune disorders).
HCV/HIV co-infected patients For HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin, other undesirable effects (that were not reported in mono-infected patients) which have been reported in the larger studies with a frequency > 5% were: oral candidiasis (14%), lipodystrophy acquired (13%), CD4 lymphocytes decreased (8%), appetite decreased (8%), gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (9%), back pain (5%), blood amylase increased (6%), blood lactic acid increased (5%), cytolytic hepatitis (6%), lipase increased (6%) and pain in limb (6%).
Mitochondrial toxicity:
Mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis have been reported in HIV-positive patients receiving NRTI regimen and associated ribavirin for co-HCV infection (see section 4.4).
Laboratory values for HCV/HIV co-infected patients:
Although haematological toxicities of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurred more frequently in HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the majority could be managed by dose modification and rarely required premature discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Haematological abnormalities were more frequently reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin when compared to patients receiving interferon alfa-2b in combination with ribavirin.
In Study 1 (see section 5.1), decrease in absolute neutrophil count levels below 500 cells/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients and decrease in platelets below 50,000/mm3 was observed in 4% (8/194) of patients receiving ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Anaemia (hemoglobin < 9.4g/dl) was reported in 12% (23/194) of patients treated with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
CD4 lymphocytes decrease:Treatment with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin was associated with decreases in absolute CD4+ cell counts within the first 4 weeks without a reduction in CD4+ cell percentage.
The decrease in CD4+ cell counts was reversible upon dose reduction or cessation of therapy.
The use of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin had no observable negative impact on the control of HIV viraemia during therapy or follow-up.
Limited safety data (N= 25) are available in co-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 200/µl (see section 4.4).
Please refer to the respective Summary of Product Characteristics of the antiretroviral medicinal products that are to be taken concurrently with HCV therapy for awareness and management of toxicities specific for each product and the potential for overlapping toxicities with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
4.9 Overdose
Doses up to 10.5 times the intended dose have been reported.
The maximum daily dose reported is 1,200 µg for one day.
In general, the adverse events seen in overdose cases involving ViraferonPeg are
221 consistent with the known safety profile for ViraferonPeg; however, the severity of the events may be increased.
Standard methods to increase elimination of the medicinal product, e.g., dialysis, have not been shown to be useful.
No specific antidote for ViraferonPeg is available; therefore, symptomatic treatment and close observation of the patient are recommended in cases of overdose.
If available, prescribers are advised to consult with a poison control centre (PCC).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Immunostimulants, Cytokines and immunomodulators, Interferons, Peginterferon alfa-2b, ATC code:
L03A B10.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is covalently conjugated with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol at an average degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein.
The average molecular mass is approximately 31,300 daltons of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 19,300.
Interferon alfa-2b In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the biological activity of ViraferonPeg is derived from its interferon alfa-2b moiety.
Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface.
Studies with other interferons have demonstrated species specificity.
However, certain monkey species, e.g., Rhesus monkeys, are susceptible to pharmacodynamic stimulation upon exposure to human type 1 interferons.
Once bound to the cell membrane, interferon initiates a complex sequence of intracellular events that include the induction of certain enzymes.
It is thought that this process, at least in part, is responsible for the various cellular responses to interferon, including inhibition of virus replication in virus- infected cells, suppression of cell proliferation and such immunomodulating activities as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells.
Any or all of these activities may contribute to interferon’s therapeutic effects.
Recombinant interferon alfa-2b also inhibits viral replication in vitro and in vivo.
Although the exact antiviral mode of action of recombinant interferon alfa-2b is unknown, it appears to alter the host cell metabolism.
This action inhibits viral replication or if replication occurs, the progeny virions are unable to leave the cell.
ViraferonPeg ViraferonPeg pharmacodynamics were assessed in a rising single-dose trial in healthy subjects by examining changes in oral temperature, concentrations of effector proteins such as serum neopterin and 2’5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (2’5’-OAS), as well as white cell and neutrophil counts.
Subjects treated with ViraferonPeg showed mild dose-related elevations in body temperature.
Following single doses of ViraferonPeg between 0.25 and 2.0 micrograms/kg/week, serum neopterin concentration was increased in a dose-related manner.
Neutrophil and white cell count reductions at the end of week 4 correlated with the dose of ViraferonPeg.
ViraferonPeg clinical trials – Naïve patients Two pivotal trials have been conducted, one (C/I97-010) with ViraferonPeg monotherapy; the other (C/I98-580) with ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin.
Eligible patients for these trials had chronic hepatitis C confirmed by a positive HCV-RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (> 30 IU/ml), a liver biopsy consistent with a histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis with no other cause for the chronic hepatitis, and abnormal serum ALT.
222 In the ViraferonPeg monotherapy trial, a total of 916 naïve chronic hepatitis C patients were treated with ViraferonPeg (0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 micrograms/kg/week) for one year with a follow-up period of six months.
In addition, 303 patients received interferon alfa-2b (3 million International Units [MIU] three times a week) as a comparator.
This study showed that Viraferon Peg was superior to interferon alfa-2b (Table 5).
In the Viraferon Peg combination trial, 1,530 naïve patients were treated for one year with one of the following combination regimens: • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) + ribavirin (800 mg/day), (n = 511). • ViraferonPeg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week for one month followed by 0.5 microgram/kg/week for 11 months) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day), (n = 514). • Interferon alfa-2b (3 MIU three times a week) + ribavirin (1,000/1,200 mg/day) (n = 505).
In this trial, the combination of Viraferon Peg (1.5 micrograms/kg/week) and ribavirin was significantly more effective than the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (Table 5), particularly in patients infected with Genotype 1 (Table 6).
Sustained response was assessed by the response rate six months after the cessation of treatment.
HCV genotype and baseline virus load are prognostic factors which are known to affect response rates.
However, response rates in this trial were shown to be dependent also on the dose of ribavirin administered in combination with ViraferonPeg or interferon alfa-2b.
