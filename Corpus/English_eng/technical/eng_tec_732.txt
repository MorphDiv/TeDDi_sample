see i53756
Press Enter to switch to edit mode
Allows you to immediately edit the selected cell after pressing the Enter key.
Expand formatting
Specifies whether to automatically apply the formatting attributes of the selected cell to the empty adjacent cells.
If, for example, the contents of the selected cell have the bold attribute, this bold attribute will also apply to adjacent cells.
Cells that already have a special format will not be modified by this function.
You can see the range in question by pressing the
Command
Ctrl
+ * (multiplication sign on the number pad) shortcut.
This format also applies to all new values inserted within this range.
The normal default settings apply to cells outside this range.
Expand references when new columns/rows are inserted
Specifies whether to expand references when inserting columns or rows adjacent to the reference range.
This is only possible if the reference range, where the column or row is inserted, originally spanned at least two cells in the desired direction.
Example:
If the range A1:B1 is referenced in a formula and you insert a new column after column B, the reference is expanded to A1:C1.
If the range A1:B1 is referenced and a new row is inserted under row 1, the reference is not expanded, since there is only a single cell in the vertical direction.
If you insert rows or columns in the middle of a reference area, the reference is always expanded.
Highlight selection in column/row headings
Specifies whether to highlight column and row headers in the selected columns or rows.
Use printer metrics for text formatting
Specifies that printer metrics are applied for printing and also for formatting the display on the screen.
If this check box is not marked, a printer independent layout will be used for screen display and printing.
Show overwrite warning when pasting data
Specifies that, when you paste cells from the clipboard to a cell range that is not empty, a warning appears.
