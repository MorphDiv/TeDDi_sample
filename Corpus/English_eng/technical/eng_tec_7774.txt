EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
PANRETIN EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Panretin?
Panretin is a gel containing the active substance alitretinoin (0.1%).
What is Panretin used for?
Panretin gel is used to treat skin lesions (lumps or swellings) in patients with Kaposi’ s sarcoma, a type of skin cancer, in AIDS patients.
Panretin is used when: • the lesions are not ulcerated or lymphoedematous (the skin has not broken and the lesions are not swollen with fluid), and • they have not responded to the antiretroviral treatment the patient is already receiving, and • radiotherapy or chemotherapy is not appropriate, and • the patient does not need treatment for visceral (internal) Kaposi’ s sarcoma.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Panretin used?
Panretin treatment should be initiated and maintained by a doctor experienced in the treatment of patients with Kaposi’ s sarcoma.
Panretin is applied twice a day to the skin lesions, avoiding healthy skin, using enough gel to cover each lesion with a generous coating, then left to dry for three to five minutes before covering with clothing.
Depending on each lesion’ s response to treatment, the number of applications can be increased to three or four times a day.
Panretin is usually applied for up to 12 weeks at first, and treatment continued after this period only on lesions which have responded to treatment.
Panretin is used in male patients, and there is very little information about its use in female patients, since they rarely suffer from Kaposi’ s sarcoma.
How does Panretin work?
The active substance in Panretin, alitretinoin, is an anticancer agent that belongs to the group of retinoids, substances that are derived from vitamin A.
The exact way alitretinoin works in Kaposi’ s sarcoma is unknown.

Panretin has been examined in two 12-week studies in patients with Kaposi’ s sarcoma, involving a total of 402 patients, where the effectiveness of Panretin was compared to that of placebo (a dummy treatment, in this instance the gel without the active substance).
The main measure of effectiveness was the overall response to treatment, looking at the response of the lesions treated (lesions covering a smaller area, flatter lesions).
What benefit has Panretin shown during the studies?
In both studies, Panretin was more effective than placebo, with an overall response to treatment of 35% and 37% in patient using Panretin compared with 18% and 7% in patients using placebo.
What is the risk associated with Panretin?
The most common side effect with Panretin (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are rash (redness, scaling, inflammation), pruritus (itching), skin disorders (cracking, scabbing, crusting, draining, oozing) and pain (burning, soreness).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Panretin, see the Package Leaflet.
Panretin should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to retinoids in general, alitretinoin, or any of the other ingredients.
Panretin should also not be used in patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Panretin should also not be used to treat lesions that are close to other skin disorders.
Why has Panretin been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Panretin’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDS- related Kaposi’ s sarcoma.
They recommended that Panretin be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Panretin:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Panretin on 11 October 2000.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 11 October 2005.
The marketing authorisation holder is Eisai Ltd.
