Invitation
& Manage Invitations (%1)...
An invitation creates a one-time password that allows the receiver to connect to your desktop. It is valid for only one successful connection and will expire after an hour if it has not been used. When somebody connects to your computer a dialog will appear and ask you for permission. The connection will not be established before you accept it. In this dialog you can also restrict the other person to view your desktop only, without the ability to move your mouse pointer or press keys. If you want to create a permanent password for Desktop Sharing, allow'Uninvited Connections' in the configuration.

When sending an invitation by email, note that everybody who reads this email will be able to connect to your computer for one hour, or until the first successful connection took place, whichever comes first. You should either encrypt the email or at least send it only in a secure network, but not over the Internet.

Personal Invitation
Desktop Sharing uses the VNC protocol. You can use any VNC client to connect. In KDE the client is called'Remote Desktop Connection '. Enter the host information into the client and it will connect..
This field contains the address of your computer and the display number, separated by a colon. The address is just a hint - you can use any address that can reach your computer. Desktop Sharing tries to guess your address from your network configuration, but does not always succeed in doing so. If your computer is behind a firewall it may have a different address or be unreachable for other computers.
