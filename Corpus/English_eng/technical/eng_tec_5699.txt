Configuring & kmplot;
To access the & kmplot; configuration dialog, select Settings Configure & kmplot;.... The settings for Constants... can only be changed from the Edit menu and the Coordinate System... only from the View menu.
General Configuration

Here you can set global settings which automatic will be saved when you exit & kmplot;. you can set angle-mode (radians and degrees), zoom in and zoom out factors, and whether to show advanced plot tracing.
Diagram Configuration

You can set the Grid Style to one of four options:
None
No gridlines are drawn on the plot area
Lines
Straight lines form a grid of squares on the plot area.
Crosses
Crosses are drawn to indicate points where x and y have integer values (eg;, (1,1), (4,2) & etc;).
Polar
Lines of constant radius and of constant angle are drawn on the plot area.
Other options for the diagram appearance can also be configured:
Axis width:
Sets the width of the lines representing the axes.
Line width:
Sets the width of the lines used for drawing the grid.
Tic width:
Sets the width of the lines representing tics on the axes.
Tic length:
Sets the length of the lines representing tics on the axes.
Show labels
If checked, the names (x, y) of the axes are shown on the plot and the axes' tics are labeled.
Show axes
If checked, the axes are visible.
Show arrows
If checked, the axes are displayed with arrows at their ends.
Colors Configuration

In the Coords section of the Colors configuration dialog, you can change the colors of the axes, the grid and the background of the main & kmplot; area.
The Default Function Colors control which colors are cycled through when creating new functions.
Fonts Configuration

Axis labels
The font used for drawing the axis numbers and x/ y labels.
Diagram label
The font used for drawing diagram labels (eg;, those showing the plot name or extreme points).
Header table
The font used for drawing the header when printing a plot.
Coordinate System Configuration

Axes Configuration
X-axis Range
Sets the range for the x-axis scale. Note that you can use the predefined functions and constants (see) as the extremes of the range (eg;, set Min: to 2*pi). You can even use functions you have defined to set the extremes of the axis range. For example, if you have defined a function f(x) = x^2, you could set Min: to f(3), which would make the lower end of the range equal to 9.
Y-axis Range
Sets the range for the y-axis. See X-axis Range above.
X-axis Grid Spacing
This controls the spacing between grid lines in the horizontal direction. If Automatic is selected, then & kmplot; will try to find a grid line spacing of about two centimeters that is also numerically nice. If Custom is selected, then you can enter the horizontal grid spacing. This value will be used regardless of the zoom. For example, if a value of 0.5 is entered, and the x range is 0 to 8, then 16 grid lines will be shown.
Y-axis Grid Spacing
This controls the spacing between grid lines in the vertical direction. See Y-axis Grid Spacing above.
Constants Configuration

Screenshot of the Constants dialog
Constants can be used as part of an expression anywhere inside of & kmplot;. Each constant must have a name and a value. Some names are invalid, however, such as existing function names or existing constants.
There are two options that control the scope of a constant:
Document
If you select the Document checkbox, then the Constant will be saved along with the current diagram when you save it to file. However, unless you have also selected the Global option, the constant will not be available between instances of & kmplot;.
Global
If you select the Global checkbox, then the Constant's name and value will be written to & kde; settings (where it can also be used by KCalc). The constant will not be lost when & kmplot; is closed, and will be available again for use when & kmplot; is started again.
Axis font
Label font
The second page let you define you own constants. & kmplot; saves the constants in the same file as & kcalc; does. That means you can create a constant in & kmplot;, close the program and load it in & kcalc; and vice versa. & kmplot; only supports constant names that consist of one capital character and if you in & kcalc; define a constant name that is not one character, the name will be truncated. E. g, if you already have the constants "apple" and "bananas" in & kcalc;, they will be renamed to "A" and "B" in & kmplot;.
X-Axis
Y-Axis
Show extra frame
If checked, the plot area is framed by an extra line.
The Grid Configuration
The Line width option is used to set the width of the lines of the grid.
For each axis, you can set the Scaling: and Printing: of one tic. The Scaling: option selects how many units apart the axis tics will be (and therefore, how far apart grid lines will be drawn), and the Printing: option selects the length of one tic when displayed on the screen or printed. In this way, these options can be used to change the size of the graph on screen or on a page: For example, doubling the Printing: setting whilst keeping the Scaling: setting the same will result in the graph doubling in in height or width.
Header table: sets the font for the information table shown in & kmplot; printouts, and Axis font: and Axis font size: sets the font and its size used for all labels on the axes in the plot area.
Settings changed in the & kmplot; configuration dialog become the default for & kmplot;, and only take effect when a new plot is started. Settings changed in the Edit menu take effect immediately, but do not persist after & kmplot; is exited.
