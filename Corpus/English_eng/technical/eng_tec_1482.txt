Libraries, Modules and Dialogue Boxes
The following describes the basic use of libraries, modules and dialogue boxes in $[officename] Basic.
$[officename] Basic provides tools to help you structuring your projects.
It supports various &quot; units &quot; which enable you to group individual SUBS and FUNCTIONS in a Basic project.
Libraries
Libraries serve as a tool for organising modules and can either be attached to a document or a template.
When the document or a template is saved, all modules contained in the library are automatically saved as well.
A library can contain up to 16,000 modules.
Modules
A module contains SUBS and FUNCTIONS along with variable declarations.
The length of the program that can be saved in a module is limited to 64 KB.
If more space is required you can divide a $[officename] Basic project among several modules and then save them in a single library.
Dialogue Box Modules
Dialogue Box modules contain dialogue box definitions, including the dialogue box properties, the properties of each dialogue box element and the events assigned.
Since a dialogue box module can only contain a single dialogue box, they are often referred to as &quot; dialogue boxes &quot; .
