Runs a program with elevated privileges
kdesu -c -d -f file -i icon name -n -p priority -r -s -t -u user --nonewdcop command arg1 arg2
kdesu KDE Generic Options Qt Generic Options
Description
& kdesu; is a graphical front end for the & UNIX; su command for the K Desktop Environment. It allows you to run a program as different user by supplying the password for that user. & kdesu; is an unprivileged program; it uses the system's su.
& kdesu; has one additional feature: it can optionally remember passwords for you. If you are using this feature, you only need to enter the password once for each command.
This program is meant to be started from the command line or from. desktop files.
Options
-c program
This specifies the program to run as root. It has to be passed in one argument. So if, for example, you want to start a new file manager, you would enter at the prompt: kdesu -c kfm -sw
-d
Show debug information.
-f file
This option allow efficient use of & kdesu; in. desktop files. It tells & kdesu; to examine the file specified by file. If this file is writable by the current user, & kdesu; will execute the command as the current user. If it is not writable, the command is executed as user user (defaults to root).
file is evaluated like this: if file starts with a /, it is taken as an absolute filename. Otherwise, it is taken as the name of a global & kde; configuration file. For example: to configure the K display manager, kdm, you could issue kdesu -c kdmconfig -f kdmrc
-i icon name
Specify icon to use in the password dialog. You may specify just the name, without any extension.
-n
Do not keep the password. This disables the keep password checkbox in the password dialog.
-p priority
Set priority value. The priority is an arbitrary number between 0 and 100, where 100 means highest priority, and 0 means lowest. The default is 50.
-r
Use realtime scheduling.
-s
Stop the kdesu daemon. This is the daemon that caches successful passwords in the background. This feature may also be disabled with -n when & kdesu; is initially run.
-t
Enable terminal output. This disables password keeping. This is largely for debugging purposes; if you want to run a console mode app, use the standard su instead.
-u user
While the most common use for & kdesu; is to run a command as the superuser, you can supply any user name and the appropriate password.

More detailed user documentation is available from help: / kdesu (either enter this URL into & konqueror;, or run khelpcenter help: / kdesu).
Examples
Run kfmclient as user jim, and show the & konqueror; icon in the password dialog:
kdesu -u jim -i konqueror kfmclient
