Frame stack Often referred to as the "call stack", this is a list showing which function is currently active, and what called each function to get to this point in your program. By clicking on an item you can see the values in any of the previous calling functions.

Breakpoint has errors
Breakpoint is pending Pending breakpoints are those that have been passed to GDB, but which are not yet installed in the target, because GDB cannot find the function or file to which the breakpoint refers. The most common case is a breakpoint in a shared library: GDB will insert this breakpoint only when the library is loaded.
Breakpoint is dirty The breakpoint has not yet been passed to the debugger.

Debugger Variables
Variable tree The variable tree allows you to see the values of local variables and arbitrary expressions. Local variables are displayed automatically and are updated as you step through your program. For each expression you enter, you can either evaluate it once, or "watch" it (make it auto-updated). Expressions that are not auto-updated can be updated manually from the context menu. Expressions can be renamed to more descriptive names by clicking on the name column. To change the value of a variable or an expression, click on the value.
