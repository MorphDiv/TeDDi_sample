Adabas D Database
/text/shared/explorer/database/30000000.xhp
Adabas D Database
Adabas D by Software AG is installed when you install the commercial office software by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
If you are using OpenOffice.org software, the Adabas D software package can be downloaded and installed separately (see www.adabas.com).
The Adabas D database that you may have installed together with $[officename] is a limited version of the database.
For more information on Adabas, visit the Software AG Web site at http://www.softwareag.com/adabas/.
About Adabas
The Adabas database that you may have installed together with $[officename] is restricted to a size of 100 MB, and a maximum of three users on a network.
See the &quot; License.txt &quot; file in the Adabas directory for more details.
The Adabas database must be installed in a separate directory from $[officename].
The name of an Adabas file cannot exceed 8 characters.
The path to the Adabas file, including the file name, cannot exceed 30 characters, and must be compliant with the 7-bit ASCII code.
Both the path and the file name cannot contain spaces.
Under Windows, the Adabas set-up application adds the DBROOT environment variable that contains the path information for the database.
If the set-up application finds this variable, it does not install the database.
