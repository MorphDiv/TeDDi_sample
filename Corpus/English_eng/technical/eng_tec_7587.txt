Econor 10% and 50%:
The treatment and prevention of swine dysentery.
The treatment of clinical signs of porcine proliferative enteropathy (ileitis).
The prevention of clinical signs of porcine colonic spirochaetosis (colitis) when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd.
Treatment and prevention of swine enzootic pneumonia.

2 Econor 0.5% and 1%:
For the treatment and prevention of swine dysentery.
The treatment of clinical signs of porcine proliferative enteropathy (ileitis).
The prevention of clinical signs of porcine colonic spirochaetosis (colitis) when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not administer the product to pigs receiving ionophores.
Valnemulin should not be administered to rabbits because of its toxicity in this species.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precaution(s) for use
Special precautions for use in animals Adverse drug reactions have occurred following the use of Econor.
Their occurrence may be principally restricted to the Scandinavian countries and appears to be mainly associated with breed mixes that include Danish and/ or Swedish Landrace.
Extreme care should therefore be taken in the use of Econor in pigs of Scandinavian origin especially of the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds, and their crossbreeds thereof.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals When mixing the product and handling the final feed containing the product, direct contact with the skin and mucous membranes should be avoided.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the product label.
People with known hypersensitivity to valnemulin should administer the product with caution.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Medication of pigs with Econor has led to the occurrence of adverse reactions in the European Union.
Of the cases reported in 1999-2000, the majority occurred in Denmark and Sweden (one case each in Finland and Ireland).
In these countries, the incidence ranged from 0.03 to 1.76% of all pigs treated.
On affected farms, one third of the pigs treated were affected, with a mortality of 1%.
Affected pigs are pyrexic, exhibit inappetence, and in severe cases become incoordinated, ataxic and may become recumbent.
A percentage of such pigs may also suffer oedema or erythema (posterior in distribution), and palpebral oedema.
The reaction has been studied in controlled trials in susceptible animals.
Mortality was less than 1%, but might be increased as a result of secondary infections.
In the case of an adverse reaction, immediate withdrawal of medication is recommended.
Severely affected pigs should be removed to clean dry pens and given symptomatic treatment, including treatment for concurrent disease.
An epidemiological survey has indicated that there is likely to be an association between the susceptibility to adverse reactions and the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds, and their crossbreds thereof, especially younger pigs.
Valnemulin is well-accepted in feed, but administered at concentrations above 200 mg valnemulin / kg feed may result in transient reduction in food consumption associated with unpalatability during the first few days of feeding.
3 4.7 Use during pregnancy and lactation
Whilst studies in rats and mice have not produced any evidence of teratogenic effect, the safety in pregnant and lactating sows has not been established.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Valnemulin has been shown to interact with ionophores such as monensin, salinomycin and narasin and may result in signs indistinguishable from an ionophore toxicosis.
Animals should not receive products containing monensin, salinomycin or narasin, during or at least 5 days before or after treatment with valnemulin.
Severe growth depression, ataxia, paralysis or death may result.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
In feed use.
The uptake of medicated feed depends on the clinical condition of the animal.
In order to obtain the correct dosage the concentration of Econor has to be adjusted.
Inclusion levels may also need to be increased in older pigs or pigs on restricted feed to achieve target dosage.
Indication Treatment of
Dosage (active substance)
Application period of medicated feed as the sole daily ration

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antibacterial for systemic use
ATCvet code:
QJ01XQ02
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties:
Valnemulin is an antibiotic belonging to the pleuromutilin group, which acts by the inhibition of the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of the bacterial ribosome.
Valnemulin has activity against a range of bacteria including those responsible for enteric and respiratory disease in pigs.
Valnemulin shows high activity against Mycoplasma spp. and spirochaetes such as Brachyspira hyodysenteriae and Brachyspira pilosicoli.
Species
MIC (Range) (µg/ ml)
MIC50 (µg/ ml)
MIC90 (µg/ ml)
Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae Brachyspira hyodysenteriae Brachyspira pilosicoli Lawsonia intracellularis
0.0009 – 0.125 0.025 – 4.0 0.0156 – 2.0 < 2.0 is the concentration likely to cause significant inhibition of intracellular growth
0.0025 0.2 0.0156
0.01 1.0 0.5
Valnemulin has little activity against Enterobacteriaceae, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli.
6 5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars:
In pigs, after a single oral dose of radiolabelled material > 90% absorption was demonstrated.
Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of radio-labelled or ‘ cold’ material were obtained 1-4 hours after dosing (Tmax) with a plasma half-life (t½), estimated from non-radioactive data, between 1 and 4½ hours.
A linear relationship between concentration and dose administered was established.
After repeat dosing, slight accumulation occurred, but a steady state was achieved within 5 days.
Because of a marked ‘ first pass’ effect, plasma concentrations are affected by the method of administration, but valnemulin is highly concentrated in tissues, particularly the lungs and liver, relative to plasma.
Five days after the last of 15 doses of radiolabelled valnemulin administered to pigs, the concentration in liver was > 6 times that in plasma.
Two hours after withdrawal of Premix given in feed twice daily for 4 weeks at a dose of 15 mg/ kg bodyweight/ day, liver concentration was 1.58 µg/ g and lung concentration 0.23 µg/ g whereas concentrations in plasma were below the limit of detection.
In pigs valnemulin is extensively metabolised and excretion of parent molecule and metabolites occurs mainly via bile.
73% - 95% of the daily dose of total radioactivity was recovered from the faeces.
The plasma half-life was 1.3 – 2.7 hours, and the majority of the total radio-activity administered was excreted within 3 days of the last administration.

NAME OF THE VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Econor 1% premix for medicated feed for pigs
Valnemulin hydrochloride
3.
STATEMENT OF THE ACTIVE AND OTHER SUBSTANCES
Econor 1% premix contains valnemulin in the form of valnemulin hydrochloride.
Valnemulin hydrochloride equivalent to valnemulin base
10.65 mg/ g 10 mg/ g
List of excipients:
Hypromellose and talc Colloidal anhydrous silica Isopropyl myristate Lactose
4.
INDICATION(S)
The treatment and prevention of swine dysentery.
The treatment of clinical signs of porcine proliferative enteropathy (ileitis).
The prevention of clinical signs of porcine colonic spirochaetosis (colitis) when the disease has been diagnosed in the herd.
5.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not administer the product to pigs receiving ionophores.
Valnemulin should not be administered to rabbits because of its toxicity in this species.
27 6.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Medication of pigs with Econor has led to the occurrence of adverse reactions in the European Union.
Of the cases reported in 1999-2000, the majority occurred in Denmark and Sweden (one case each in Finland and Ireland).
In these countries, the incidence ranged from 0.03 to 1.76% of all pigs treated.
On affected farms, one third of the pigs treated were affected, with a mortality of 1%.
Affected pigs are pyrexic, exhibit inappetence, and in severe cases become incoordinated, ataxic and may become recumbent.
A percentage of such pigs may also suffer oedema or erythema (posterior in distribution), and palpebral oedema.
The reaction has been studied in controlled trials in susceptible animals.
Mortality was less than 1% but might be increased as a result of secondary infections.
In the case of an adverse reaction, immediate withdrawal of medication is recommended.
Severely affected pigs should be removed to clean dry pens and given symptomatic treatment, including treatment for concurrent disease.
An epidemiological survey has indicated that there is likely to be an association between the susceptibility to adverse reactions and the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds, and their crossbreds thereof, especially younger pigs.
Valnemulin is well-accepted in feed, but administered at concentrations above 200 mg/ kg feed may result in transient reduction in food consumption associated with unpalatability during the first few days of feeding.
If you notice any other side effects, please inform your veterinary surgeon.

DOSAGE, ROUTE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
In-feed use
The uptake of medicated feed depends on the clinical condition of the animal.
In order to obtain the correct dosage the concentration of Econor has to be adjusted.
Inclusion levels may also need to be increased in older pigs or pigs on restricted feed to achieve target dosage.
Indication
Dosage
(mg active substance/ kg)
Application period of medicated feed as the sole daily ration
Application in feed
Incorporation of 75 mg active
Treatment of
substance per kg feed with:
Swine Dysentery
3-4 mg/ kg bodyweight/ day
Minimum of 7 days and up to 4 weeks or until signs of disease disappear
Econor 1% - 7.5 g/ kg feed
This dose level is effective in the treatment of clinical disease, but higher dosages or longer duration of treatment may be necessary for complete elimination of infection.
It is important to institute medication as early as possible in an outbreak of swine dysentery.
If there is no response to treatment within 5 days, the diagnosis should be re-established.

Long term preventative use of valnemulin should be avoided by improving management practice and thorough cleansing and disinfection.
Consideration should be given to the eradication of infection from the farm.
9.
ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION:
Mixing Instructions:
mg Econor 1% premix/ kg feed = Dosage required (mg/ kg) x 100 x bodyweight (kg)/ Daily feed intake (kg)
The product has been shown to be stable to the pelleting process at temperatures of 75oC.
Aggressive pelleting conditions such as temperatures in excess of 80oC, and the use of abrasive substances for pre- mixture should be avoided.
29 To achieve good mixture and homogeneity of incorporation, especially when product is incorporated at a rate less then 5 kg/ tonne feed, the use of a pre-mixture is recommended.
The required quantity of product is thoroughly mixed with a feed ingredient of similar physical nature (e. g. wheat middlings) in the proportion:
1 part Econor 1% premix to 10 parts feed ingredient.
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the incorporation of medicated premixes in final feeds.
10.
WITHDRAWAL PERIOD

SPECIAL WARNINGS:
Valnemulin has been shown to interact with ionophores such as monensin, salinomycin and narasin and may result in signs indistinguishable from an ionophore toxicosis.
Animals should not receive products containing monensin, salinomycin or narasin, during or at least 5 days before or after treatment with valnemulin.
Severe growth depression, ataxia, paralysis or death may result.
Whilst studies in rats and mice have not produced any evidence of teratogenic effect, the safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established in pigs.
When mixing the product and handling the final feed containing the product, direct contact with the skin and mucous membranes should be avoided.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the product label.
People with known hypersensitivity to valnemulin should administer the product with caution.
Adverse drug reactions have occurred following the use of Econor.
Their occurrence may be principally restricted to the Scandinavian countries and appears to be mainly associated with breed mixes that include Danish and/ or Swedish Landrace.
Extreme care should therefore be taken in the use of Econor in pigs of Scandinavian origin especially of the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds, and their crossbreeds thereof.

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
Valnemulin has been shown to interact with ionophores such as monensin, salinomycin and narasin and may result in signs indistinguishable from an ionophore toxicosis.
Animals should not receive products containing monensin, salinomycin or narasin, during or at least 5 days before or after treatment with valnemulin.
Severe growth depression, ataxia, paralysis or death may result.
Whilst studies in rats and mice have not produced any evidence of teratogenic effect, the safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established in pigs.
When mixing the product and handling the final feed containing the product, direct contact with the skin and mucous membranes should be avoided.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the product label.
People with known hypersensitivity to valnemulin should administer the product with caution.
Adverse drug reactions have occurred following the use of Econor.
Their occurrence may be principally restricted to the Scandinavian countries and appears to be mainly associated with breed mixes that include Danish and/ or Swedish Landrace.
Extreme care should therefore be taken in the use of Econor in pigs of Scandinavian origin especially of the Danish and Swedish Landrace breeds, and their crossbreeds thereof.
