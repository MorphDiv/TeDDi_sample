Regular Expression Editor What you are currently looking at is an editor for Regular Expressions. The upper part in the middle is the editing area, the lower part is a verification window where you can try your regular expressions right away. The row of buttons is the editing actions. This is actually very similar to common drawing programs. Select an editing tool to start editing your regular expression, and press the mouse button in the editing area where you want this item inserted. For a more detailed description of this editor see the info pages What is a regular expression? If you do not know what a regular expression is, then it might be a good idea to read the introduction to regular expressions.
Send the author an electronic postcard I do n't get any money for working on KRegExpEditor, I therefore appreciate it very much when users tell me what they think about my work. I would therefore be very happy if you sent me a short mail, telling me that you use my regular expression editor. Author Jesper K. Pedersen & lt; blackie@kde. org gt;
Regular Expression Editor
Compound regular expression:
In this window you will find predefined regular expressions. Both regular expressions you have developed and saved, and regular expressions shipped with the system.
In this window you will develop your regular expressions. Select one of the actions from the action buttons above, and click the mouse in this window to insert the given action.
Type in some text in this window, and see what the regular expression you have developed matches. Each second match will be colored in red and each other match will be colored blue, simply so you can distinguish them from each other. If you select part of the regular expression in the editor window, then this part will be highlighted - This allows you to debug your regular expressions
ASCII syntax:
Clear expression
This is the regular expression in ASCII syntax. You are likely only to be interested in this if you are a programmer, and need to develop a regular expression using QRegExp. You may develop your regular expression both by using the graphical editor, and by typing the regular expression in this line edit.

anything
This regular expression matches anything.
spaces
Matches an arbitrary amount of whitespace.
Your names
Your emails
Selection tool
This will change the state of the editor to selection state. In this state you will not be inserting regexp items, but instead select them. To select a number of items, press down the left mouse button and drag it over the items. When you have selected a number of items, you may use cut/ copy/ paste. These functions are found in the right mouse button menu.
Text
This will insert a text field, where you may write text. The text you write will be matched literally. (i. e. you do not need to escape any characters)
A single character specified in a range
This will match a single character from a predefined range. When you insert this widget a dialog box will appear, which lets you specify which characters this regexp item will match.
Any character
This will match any single character
Repeated content
This regexp item will repeat the regexp items it surrounds a specified number of times. The number of times to repeat may be specified using ranges; e. g. it could be specified that it should match from 2 to 4 times, that it should match exactly 5 times, or that it should match at least one time. Examples: If you specify that it should match any time, and the content it surrounds is abc, then this regexp item will match the empty string, the string abc, the string abcabc, the string abcabcabcabc, etc.
This regexp item will match any of its alternatives. Alternatives are specified by placing regexp items on top of each other inside this widget.
Compound regexp
This regexp item serves two purposes: It makes it possible for you to collapse a huge regexp item into a small box. This makes it easier for you to get an overview of large regexp items. This is especially useful if you load a predefined regexp item that you perhaps do not care about the inner workings of.
Beginning of line
This will match the beginning of a line.
End of line
This will match the end of a line.
Word boundary
This asserts a word boundary (This part does not actually match any characters)
Non Word boundary
This asserts a non-word boundary (This part does not actually match any characters)
Positive Look Ahead
This asserts a regular expression (This part does not actually match any characters). You can only use this at the end of a regular expression.
Negative Look Ahead
This asserts a regular expression that must not match (This part does not actually match any characters). You can only use this at the end of a regular expression.

Verify regular expression
Shows what part of the regular expression is being matched in the verifier window. (The window below the graphical editor window).
Load text in the verifier window
Verification Settings
Verify on the Fly
Toggle on-the-fly verification of regular expression
Enabling this option will make the verifier update for each edit. If the verify window contains much text, or if the regular expression is either complex or matches a lot of time, this may be very slow.
Match Greedy
Toggle greedy matching when verifying the regular expression.
When this option is enabled, the regular expression will be evaluated on a so-called greedy way.
