Browsing
Once you have annotated your images and videos, & kphotoalbum; is ready to let you browse through your images, see. If you compare that to, you will see that there now is items available in each of the categories for People, Places, and Keywords.
Browser when images and videos have been annotated
In the browser window you can see the categories you typed information into when annotating your images and videos. In addition there are items for searching based on EXIF information on images, browsing the folder structure of your hard disk, and of course showing the actual thumbnails. Lets describe each item in turn.
Pressing the mouse on People, the browser window will change, as you can see in.
Browser window when People was selected.
The browser is now populated with the people you specified for your images and videos You may notice that the item Pets has a special icon. For details about that, see., selecting a person will bring you back to the original state for the browser, as we saw in, this time, however, we are in the scope of the person we selected. That means that we only shows information about images and videos containing that person. See below, which is the result of us selecting the Person Jesper, you can see an indication of that in the bottom of the window. Please compare with, where you will see that the number of available images and videos has gone down from 25 to 12, and the amount of items for the different categories have also changed.
Browser limited to the scope of the person Jesper
If we now continue selecting a new person, then we will get to the images containing both people. Continuing that way you can narrow the set of images that you have in mind down to a few images from a set of thousands.
When you are done limiting the scope of images, you may select the View Thumbnails icon, to see exactly those images matching your current scope.
Adding Preview Images to the Browser
Looking at you will see that each person has the same icon in front of his name. & kphotoalbum; is actually capable of showing a preview image for each individual person This of course also applies to places, keywords, and other categories you have defined yourself. as can be seen in.
Images for each Individual Person
To show images along with the names, choose the tool button to the very right of the toolbar, that will bring up a popup menu, where you can chose which view you want to use for the given category. Notice views must be configured for each category - that way you may for example use an icon view for people, but a plain list view for keywords (in case you ca n't come up with good images for your keywords).
It is, however, your job to tell it which images to use for each individual person. To do so, you must open the viewer (see), and from the context menu choose show category editor, this will bring up the category editor which can be seen in. In the category editor you choose the image for the given person. In the viewer its possible to zoom to part of the image, and that way crop what part should be shown.
Category Editor
General image searches
If you chose the Search item in the browser, you will get to a dialog with great resemblance to the dialog you used for setting properties of your images. You can see this dialog in below.
Search dialog
If you type a string in the label or description field, then that text will be searched for using substring searches. Likewise you can also specify a date to search for, either as part of a date, say 1971, or as a complete date. You may also specify date ranges, like 1971-1980.
The options item allow a very limited form of writing expression, as you can see an example of in the. Here we search for images with Jesper, but without Anne Helene.
The allowed operations are & (meaning and), | (meaning or), and! (meaning not).
