Automatically load images
If this box is checked, Konqueror will automatically load any images that are embedded in a web page. Otherwise, it will display placeholders for the images, and you can then manually load the images by clicking on the image button. Unless you have a very slow network connection, you will probably want to check this box to enhance your browsing experience.
Draw frame around not completely loaded images
If this box is checked, Konqueror will draw a frame as a placeholder around images embedded in a web page that are not yet fully loaded. You will probably want to check this box to enhance your browsing experience, especially if have a slow network connection.

Enable or disable AdBlocK filters. When enabled, a set of URL expressions should be defined in the filter list for blocking to take effect.
When enabled blocked images will be removed from the page completely, otherwise a placeholder'blocked 'image will be used.
This is the list of URL filters that will be applied to all embedded images and media objects.
Enter an expression to filter. Filters can be defined as either: a shell-style wildcard, e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ads*, the wildcards *? [] may be useda full regular expression by surrounding the string with '/ ', e. g. / \\/ (ad|banner)\\. / Any filter string can be preceded by '@@' to whitelist (allow) any matching URL, which takes priority over any blacklist (blocking) filter.
The filter import format is a plain text file. Blank lines, comment lines starting with '!' and the header line [AdBlock] are ignored. Any other line is added as a filter expression.
The filter export format is a plain text file. The file begins with a header line [AdBlock], then all of the filters follow each on a separate line.
Konqueror AdBlocK Konqueror AdBlocK allows you to create a list of filters that are checked against linked images and frames. URL's that match are either discarded or replaced with a placeholder image.
Tabbed Browsing
When & Konqueror starts:
Show Introduction Page
Show My Home Page
Show Blank Page
Show My Bookmarks
Home page:
Select Home Page
This is the URL of the web page where Konqueror (as web browser) will jump to when the "Home" button is pressed. When Konqueror is started as a file manager, that button makes it jump to your local home folder instead.
Konqueror Browser Here you can configure Konqueror's browser functionality. Please note that the file manager functionality has to be configured using the "File Manager" configuration module. You can make some settings how Konqueror should handle the HTML code in the web pages it loads. It is usually not necessary to change anything here.
Bookmarks
Ask for name and folder when adding bookmarks
If this box is checked, Konqueror will allow you to change the title of the bookmark and choose a folder in which to store it when you add a new bookmark.
Show only marked bookmarks in bookmark toolbar
If this box is checked, Konqueror will show only those bookmarks in the bookmark toolbar which you have marked to do so in the bookmark editor.
Form Completion
If this box is checked, Konqueror will remember the data you enter in web forms and suggest it in similar fields for all forms.
& Maximum completions:
Here you can select how many values Konqueror will remember for a form field.
Mouse Behavior
Change cursor over links
If this option is set, the shape of the cursor will change (usually to a hand) if it is moved over a hyperlink.
Middle click opens URL in selection
If this box is checked, you can open the URL in the selection by middle clicking on a Konqueror view.
Right click goes & back in history
If this box is checked, you can go back in history by right clicking on a Konqueror view. To access the context menu, press the right mouse button and move.
Allow automatic delayed & reloading/ redirecting
Some web pages request an automatic reload or redirection after a certain period of time. By unchecking this box Konqueror will ignore these requests.
Enable Access Key activation with Ctrl key
Pressing the Ctrl key when viewing webpages activates Access Keys. Unchecking this box will disable this accessibility feature. (Konqueror needs to be restarted for this change to take effect.)

Enables the execution of scripts written in Java that can be contained in HTML pages. Note that, as with any browser, enabling active contents can be a security problem.
This box contains the domains and hosts you have set a specific Java policy for. This policy will be used instead of the default policy for enabling or disabling Java applets on pages sent by these domains or hosts. Select a policy and use the controls on the right to modify it.
Click this button to choose the file that contains the Java policies. These policies will be merged with the existing ones. Duplicate entries are ignored.
Click this button to save the Java policy to a zipped file. The file, named java_policy. tgz, will be saved to a location of your choice.
Here you can set specific Java policies for any particular host or domain. To add a new policy, simply click the New... button and supply the necessary information requested by the dialog box. To change an existing policy, click on the Change... button and choose the new policy from the policy dialog box. Clicking on the Delete button will remove the selected policy, causing the default policy setting to be used for that domain.
Enabling the security manager will cause the jvm to run with a Security Manager in place. This will keep applets from being able to read and write to your file system, creating arbitrary sockets, and other actions which could be used to compromise your system. Disable this option at your own risk. You can modify your $HOME/. java. policy file with the Java policytool utility to give code downloaded from certain sites more permissions.
Enabling this will cause the jvm to use KIO for network transport
Enter the path to the java executable. If you want to use the jre in your path, simply leave it as'java '. If you need to use a different jre, enter the path to the java executable (e. g. / usr/ lib/ jdk/ bin/ java), or the path to the directory that contains'bin/ java' (e. g. / opt/ IBMJava2-13).
If you want special arguments to be passed to the virtual machine, enter them here.
When all the applets have been destroyed, the applet server should shut down. However, starting the jvm takes a lot of time. If you would like to keep the java process running while you are browsing, you can set the timeout value to whatever you like. To keep the java process running for the whole time that the konqueror process is, leave the Shutdown Applet Server checkbox unchecked.

Here you can set specific JavaScript policies for any particular host or domain. To add a new policy, simply click the New... button and supply the necessary information requested by the dialog box. To change an existing policy, click on the Change... button and choose the new policy from the policy dialog box. Clicking on the Delete button will remove the selected policy causing the default policy setting to be used for that domain. The Import and Export button allows you to easily share your policies with other people by allowing you to save and retrieve them from a zipped file.

Smart
Accept popup window requests only when links are activated through an explicit mouse click or keyboard operation.
If you disable this, Konqueror will stop interpreting the window. open() JavaScript command. This is useful if you regularly visit sites that make extensive use of this command to pop up ad banners. Note: Disabling this option might also break certain sites that require window. open() for proper operation. Use this feature carefully.
Resize window:
Allow scripts to change the window size.
Ignore
Ignore attempts of scripts to change the window size. The web page will think it changed the size but the actual window is not affected.
Some websites change the window size on their own by using window. resizeBy() or window. resizeTo(). This option specifies the treatment of such attempts.
Move window:
Allow scripts to change the window position.
Ignore attempts of scripts to change the window position. The web page will think it moved the window but the actual position is not affected.
Some websites change the window position on their own by using window. moveBy() or window. moveTo(). This option specifies the treatment of such attempts.
Focus window:
Allow scripts to focus the window.
Ignore attempts of scripts to focus the window. The web page will think it brought the focus to the window but the actual focus will remain unchanged.
Some websites set the focus to their browser window on their own by using window. focus(). This usually leads to the window being moved to the front interrupting whatever action the user was dedicated to at that time. This option specifies the treatment of such attempts.
Modify status bar text:
Allow scripts to change the text of the status bar.
Ignore attempts of scripts to change the status bar text. The web page will think it changed the text but the actual text will remain unchanged.
Some websites change the status bar text by setting window. status or window. defaultStatus, thus sometimes preventing displaying the real URLs of hyperlinks. This option specifies the treatment of such attempts.

Konqueror Stylesheets This module allows you to apply your own color and font settings to Konqueror by using stylesheets (CSS). You can either specify options or apply your own self-written stylesheet by pointing to its location. Note that these settings will always have precedence before all other settings made by the site author. This can be useful to visually impaired people or for web pages that are unreadable due to bad design.
Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 User defined stylesheets allow increased accessibility for visually handicapped people.
Expression (e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ad/ *):
Enter an expression to filter. Expressions can be defined as either a filename style wildcard e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ads* or as a full regular expression by surrounding the string with '/ 'e. g. / /(ad|banner)\\. /
