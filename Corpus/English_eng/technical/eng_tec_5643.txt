Introduction
Gametype:
Board, Arcade
Number of possible players:
Two
Note:
Also known as: Connect Five, Five in a row, X and O, Noughts and Crosses
How to play
Objective:
Connect five of your own pieces in an unbroken row vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
The first time & bovo; is started it is launched in demo mode where two AI players battle each other. You can always start a new game using the New button on the toolbar, the Game New menu entry on the menubar or using the default shortcut Ctrl; N.
Because the first player always has an advantage over the second player, & bovo; will alternate the players, switching them every new game.
If you are the first player - start the game by placing your pictogram anywhere on the playing field. If you are the second player wait until the first player places the pictogram and then do the same yourself. You can place your mark into any square on the field, unless it ’ s already occupied by another game piece (regardless of whether it ’ s your pictogram or that of your opponent’ s).
You have to place your pieces in a way that prevents your opponent from connecting five marks in an unbroken row vertically, horizontally or diagonally. In the same time you have to connect five of your own pieces in an unbroken row vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Whoever succeeds in doing so first – wins the round.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Game Rules
Players take turn to place their respective marks on the playing board.
A player cannot move their already placed mark or put their mark upon an already placed mark.
Players cannot forfeit their turns.
Player who reaches five marks connected in a straight line (be it vertical, horizontal or diagonal) wins the game.
Game Tips
When & bovo; is started the first time, it needs resizing. Resize the game window to desired size, and & bovo; will scale up the playing board.
The first time & bovo; is started it is launched in demo mode, where two AI players battle each other.
When & bovo; is exited prior to game over, the active game is auto saved. If & bovo; detects an auto saved game at startup, it is restored. If not, & bovo; launches a demo mode.
You can always start a new game with the New button in the toolbar, the Game New menu entry in the menubar or with the default shortcut Ctrl; N.

The effect of changing difficulty takes place immediately.
You can switch the theme of & bovo; from the Settings Theme menu in the menubar. The theme is then switched immediately.
Animation can be switched on or off as you like from the Settings Animation menu in the menubar.
If you just realized you made a very bad move, you have the possibility to undo your last move from the toolbar, the menubar or with the default undo keyboard shortcut Ctrl; Z.
You can keep on undoing moves until you reaches the beginning of the game.
If you do n't know what move to make, you can get a hint from the computer player with the Hint button. The game piece suggested by the & bovo; AI then flashes for a brief period of time.
