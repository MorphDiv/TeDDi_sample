%s: Error forking user session
Your session only lasted less than 10 seconds. If you have not logged out yourself, this could mean that there is some installation problem or that you may be out of diskspace. Try logging in with one of the failsafe sessions to see if you can fix this problem.

Note that not all configuration options are listed here. You may want to edit %s if you cannot find what you are looking for.

Adds a chooser button to the Actions menu that will restart the current X server with a chooser. XDMCP does not need to be enabled on the local computer for this to work.

Allow changing the GTK+ (widget) theme from the greeter. Currently this only affects the standard greeter. The theme will stay in effect on this display until changed and will affect all the other windows that are put up by GDM.
Allow group writable files and directories.
Allow logi_n if group write permissions on user's home directory
Allow login _if all write permissions on user's home directory
Allow world writable files and directories.
Allows the configurator to be run from the greeter. Note that the user will need to type in the root password before the configurator will be started.
Always append -nolisten tcp to the command line of local X servers, thus disallowing TCP connection. This is useful if you do not care for allowing remote connections, since the X protocol could really be potentially a security hazard to leave open, even though no known security problems exist. Also disables X forwarding, but does not affect XDMCP.

GDM should run the login window on this server and allow a user to log in. If not selected, then GDM will just run this server and wait for it to terminate.
General
Given user should be logged in after a number of seconds (set with Pause before login) of inactivity on the login screen. This is useful for public access terminals or perhaps even home use.
Given user should be logged in upon first bootup. No password will be asked. This is useful for single user workstations where local console security is not an issue.

If a user has no defined face image, GDM will use the "stock_person" icon defined in the current GTK+ theme. If no such image is defined, the image specified by DefaultFace will be used. The image must be in an gdk-pixbuf supported format and the file must be readable to the GDM user.

Themes
This server is available as a choice when a user wishes to run a flexible, on demand server.
To avoid denial of service attacks, GDM has fixed size queue of pending connections. Please note that this parameter does *not* limit the number of remote displays which can be managed. It only limits the number of displays initiating a connection simultaneously.
To prevent attackers from filling up the pending queue, GDM will only allow one connection for each remote computer. If you want to provide display services to computers with more than one screen, you should increase the this value accordingly.
Turns the Actions menu (which used to be called System menu) on or off. If this is off then one of the actions will be available anywhere. These actions include Shutdown, Restart, Custom, Configure, XDMCP chooser and such.

Users
Welcome Message
When GDM is ready to manage a remote display, an ACCEPT packet is sent to it containing a unique session id which will be used in future XDMCP conversations. GDM will then place the session id in the pending queue waiting for the display to respond with a MANAGE request. If no response is received within maximum wait time, GDM will declare the display dead and erase it from the pending queue freeing up the slot for other displays.
When the user logs in and already has an existing session, they are connected to that session rather than starting a new session. This only works for sessions running on Virtual Terminals started with gdmflexiserver, and not with XDMCP.
