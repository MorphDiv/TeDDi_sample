All Fonts contains all the fonts installed on your system. Unclassified contains all fonts that have not yet been placed within a "Custom" group.
All Fonts contains all the fonts installed on your system - both "System" and "Personal". System contains all fonts that are installed system-wide (i. e. available to all users). Personal contains your personal fonts. Unclassified contains all fonts that have not yet been placed within a "Custom" group.
Font Groups This list displays the font groups available on your system. There are 2 main types of font groups: Standard are special groups used by the font manager. %1 Custom are groups created by you. To add a font family to one of these groups simply drag it from the list of fonts, and drop onto the desired group. To remove a family from the group, drag the font onto the "All Fonts" group.
A group named '%1 'already exists.

Font Installer This module allows you to install TrueType, Type1, and Bitmap fonts. You may also install fonts using Konqueror: type fonts: / into Konqueror's location bar and this will display your installed fonts. To install a font, simply copy it into the appropriate folder - "Personal" for fonts available to just yourself, or "System" for system-wide fonts (available to all). NOTE: As you are not logged in as "root", any fonts installed will only be available to you. To install fonts system-wide, use the "Administrator Mode" button to run this module as "root".
Please note that any open applications will need to be restarted in order for any changes to be noticed. (You will also have to restart this application in order to use its print function on any newly installed fonts.)
Detailed View

Output:
Configure fonts for legacy X applications
Modern applications use a system called "FontConfig" to obtain the list of fonts. Older applications, such as OpenOffice 1. x, GIMP 1. x, etc. use the previous "core X fonts" mechanism for this. Selecting this option will inform the installer to create the necessary files so that these older applications can use the fonts you install. Please note, however, that this will slow down the installation process.
Configure fonts for Ghostscript
When printing, most applications create what is know as PostScript. This is then sent to a special application, named Ghostscript, which can interpret the PostScript and send the appropriate instructions to your printer. If your application does not embed whatever fonts it uses into the PostScript, then Ghostscript needs to be informed as to which fonts you have installed, and where they are located. Selecting this option will create the necessary Ghostscript config files. Please note, however, that this will also slow down the installation process. As most applications can, and do, embed the fonts into the PostScript before sending this to Ghostscript, this option can safely be disabled.
You have enabled a previously disabled option. Would you like the config files updated now? (Normally they are only updated upon installing, or removing, a font.)
Do Not Update
Do you wish to install the font into "%1" (in which case the font will only be usable by you), or "%2" (the font will be usable by all users - but you will need to know the administrator's password)?
Only fonts may be installed. If installing a fonts package (*%1), then extract the components, and install individually.
Where do you wish to install "%1" (%2)? "%3" - only accessible to you, or "%4" - accessible to all (requires administrator password)
%1: %2 successfully installed.
