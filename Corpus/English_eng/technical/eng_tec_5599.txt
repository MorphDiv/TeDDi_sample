Comparing & kexi; to other database applications
Although different database applications tend to provide similar functionality, they often use different terminology. For your convenience, this appendix shows how the terminology used in & kexi; corresponds to that used by other database applications. Thus, this chapter may be useful when migrating databases from one application to another.
Data types
The table below shows how the data types in & kexi; correspond to data types in other database applications.
Some of the data types listed here are sub-types of other types. For example, the Long text type is a sub-type of the Text type. To use a sub-type in & kexi;, you should select the corresponding basic type (in this case, Text) in the table designer, and then select the sub-type using the Subtype setting in the Properties Editor.
