ADO Connection
Specifies the options for adding an ADO (Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects) database.
The ADO interface is a Microsoft Windows proprietary container for connecting to databases.
$[officename] requires the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) to use the ADO interface.
Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP include these components by default.
For earlier visions of Windows, you need to install MDAC separately.
You can download MDAC from the Microsoft web site.
Data source URL
Enter the data source URL.
Example URLs
To connect to an Access 2000 file, use the format:
PROVIDER=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;DATA SOURCE=c:\Access\nwind2000.mdb
To connect with a name to a catalogue on a Microsoft SQL server that has a name turner, enter:
PROVIDER=sqloledb;DATA SOURCE=turner;INITIAL CATALOG=First
To access an ODBC driver as a provider:
DSN=SQLSERVER
