Reports
Available Reports
Reports View
Reports View
The Reports View lists all available reports, grouped under the following headings.
Income and Expenses
The reports in this section show your income and expenses either for the current month or for each month in the current year. Of course, the duration of the overall report and the duration captured by each column can be configured to your liking. Graphs and Pie Charts also may be produced.
Net Worth
Here there are reports that describe your net worth, either at the current moment, every month for the current year, or every year of your history. In addition, there is a 7-day Cash Flow Forecast and a Net Worth Graph. There are also reports to get the balances for all of your accounts at any given point in time.
Transactions
This section includes reports that list individual transactions. This is the best way to print your account register for a specific period of time. The transactions printed can be grouped together according to your liking by choosing the appropriate report, such as:
By Account
By Category
By Month or Week
By Payee
Cash Flow
The Cash Flow report is similar to a Transaction report, but it displays all cash-flow related transactions.
Investments
These reports help you keep track of your investments. They only include investment accounts. There are a variety of presentation filters and styles, as shown in this partial list.
Investment Transactions: Similar to a Transactions report, and includes the share price and quantities.
Investment Holdings by Account: Shows the current shares, price, and value for each account.
Investment Holdings by Type: Same as the previous report, but organizes the accounts by type (Stock, Mutual Fund, etc)
Investment Performance by Account: Shows the annualized performance over any period of time. This performs a cash flow analysis of all money coming into and going out of the account. As a result, this is a very accurate picture of how well your investments are doing.
Investment Performance by Type: Same as the previous report, but organizes the accounts by type (Stock, Mutual Fund, etc)
There are also graphs for Investment Prices and Investment Worth.
Taxes
The tax reports are just like the transactions reports, with the addition that only Tax related categories are included. This allows you to flag certain categories as being tax-related, and then get one big report at the end of the year to see them all in one place. They may be listed either by Category or by Payee, and for the last fiscal year.
Budgeting
The budgeting reports are similar to net worth reports, but the reports can display the budget for a given year, or even compare it to the actual income and expenses for the same period.
Forecast
The forecast reports are just like the net worth reports, but they use the information to display forecast information. You can display the information at various levels and for the timeframe of your choosing.
General Information
These reports display non-transaction information about schedules, accounts, and loans.
Charts
If Charts are enabled, this section lists all the reports which are marked to display a graphical chart as the default. They are also listed in one of the other sections, but they are also aggregated here for your easy reference.
Favorites
This section lists all the reports you have marked as a favorite in the report configuration dialog. They are still listed in one of the other sections, but they are also aggregated here for your easy reference. Favorite reports are also included on the financial summary page for even easier reference.
Configuring Reports
To access the report configuration dialog, bring up the report you wish to configure, and press the Configure button at the top of the report.
Working With Reports
There are a number of actions you can take on each report. You can access these by right-clicking the report name in the list of reports. Alternately, once you have run a report, there are buttons across the top of the view to invoke each of these:
Chart: Only present if the report is capable of displaying a chart. Clicking this option toggles between the report and the chart.
Configure: Change the properties of this report. You can customize the report to your liking and save it for future use.
New: Create a new customized report based on the selected report.
Copy: The report output can be copied to the clipboard to paste them in another application, like a spreadsheet, for further analysis.
Export: Reports can be saved in & HTML; or CSV format.
Delete: Customized reports can be deleted. The default reports that ship with & kappname; cannot be deleted.
Close: Close the current report.
Working with custom reports
You can configure the default reports or create your own from them by selecting'New 'and then configuring the new report. When you select'Configure' you will be presented with the Report Tab. Initially, it is named the same as the old report with Custom added to the end. You can change the name to whatever you want. You can even name your custom reports the same as a default report, or the same as another custom report. Also, you can always use the Comment field to further distinguish reports.
The Report Configuration dialog has a number of tabs across the top. Each tab displays options for configuring different aspects of the report.
Report Tab
Report Configuration -Report
On this tab, you set the basic properties of this report.
Report Name: Choose a name for this report.
Comment: Enter a comment to help you remember the details of this report.
Convert values to base currency: Select this option to convert all values in the report to your base currency. Leave it unchecked if you'd like to see values in their original currency. If currencies are not converted, then subtotals will not be shown.
Mark as favorite report: Check this to cause this report to show up on the home page and in the group of Favorite Reports.
Rows/ Columns Tab
On this tab, you configure how you would like the rows and columns to be selected and organized. This tab presents different configuration options depending on the style of report you have selected.
Report Configuration -Rows and Columns
For income/ expense and net worth reports:
Columns: Choose how large of a time period each column should encompass
Rows: Choose what kind of accounts to display as the rows of this report
Detail: Choose the level of detail required for this report.
The following levels of detail are available:
All: Show every category or account.
Top-Level: Show only the highest-level categories or accounts, and roll up the sums of the subordinates categories or accounts into those values.
Groups: Show only the totals of the income, expenses, assets, or liabilities.
Total: Show only the grand totals line.
For transaction reports:
Organize by: Choose how to group the transactions in this report

Include only Tax Categories: Only show categories which have been marked as tax-related.
Include only Investment Accounts: Only show transactions from investment accounts.

Chart Tab
This tab allows you to configure what the report should look like when it is displayed as a chart. See the Graphs & Charts section for more explanation of the charting functions.
Chart Type: The visual format of chart desired.
Show grid lines: Whether to print horizontal and vertical grid lines on the chart.
Draw values on chart: Whether to print the data values on the chart itself for chosen data points.
Show chart by default: Whether this report should first be displayed as a chart when it's opened.
Line width: The width of data lines on the chart.
Other Tabs
The other tabs in this dialog are the same as in the Search Transactions interface. Please refer to the documentation on that interface for details on the other tabs.
Graphs & Charts
Viewing as a Chart
Each report can be viewed in either textual form or graphical (chart) form. The same report configuration parameters are used in either case. You can easily jump back and forth between the textual and graphical forms by pressing the Chart or Report buttons along the top of the report view.
Care should be taken to limit the amount of data you choose to display on a chart. If you are not careful, using the same configuration for both textual and graphical forms means it's possible to configure a chart to be visually cluttered, unappealing, and uninformative. & kappname; will not force you to keep your charts readable and useful!
Available Chart Types
Line Graph
A line graph is one of the most simple forms of a chart. There is one line for each series. (Usually a series is a single account or category; see below for more details on that.) The time periods stretch out along the bottom axis, and the currency values are along the left.
The detail level for each line is controlled in the Rows/ Columns Tab of chart configuration. If you choose the Top-Level detail level, there will be one line for each of the top-most accounts or categories which show the sum total of all underlying accounts or categories. If you choose Groups it will instead show one line each for Income, Expenses, Assets, or Liabilities, depending on the other settings.
Bar Graph
The bar graph works exactly the same as the line graph, except there is one bar for each series in each time slice.
Pie Chart
The pie chart is the most simple chart available. It shows only one time slice, as opposed to showing the values across time. This chart shows only the totals column of whatever report is selected. If your report is configured to NOT convert values to the base currency, there will be no totals column, and therefore this report is not useful.
Ring Chart
The ring chart is very similar to a pie chart, except there is one ring for each time slice in the report.
