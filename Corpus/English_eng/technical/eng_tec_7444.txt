The vaccine strain is a recombinant canarypox virus expressing the env and gag genes of FeLV-A.
Under field conditions, only sub-group A is infective and immunisation against sub-group A provides full protection against A, B and C.
After inoculation, the virus expresses the protective proteins, but does not replicate in the cat.
As a consequence, the vaccine induces an immune status against feline leukaemia virus.
