CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs, cats
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
Cats and dogs: treatment and prevention of flea infestations caused by Ctenocephalides spp. for one month following a single administration.
This is as a result of the adulticidal, larvicidal and ovicidal properties of the product.
The product is ovicidal for 3 weeks after administration.
Through a reduction in the flea population, monthly treatment of pregnant and lactating animals will also aid in the prevention of flea infestations in the litter up to seven weeks of age.
The product can be used as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis and through its ovicidal and larvicidal action may aid in the control of existing environmental flea infestations in areas to which the animal has access.
2 Cats and dogs: prevention of heartworm disease caused by Dirofilaria immitis with monthly administration.
STRONGHOLD may be safely administered to animals infected with adult heartworms, however, it is recommended, in accordance with good veterinary practice, that all animals 6 months of age or more living in countries where a vector exists should be tested for existing adult heartworm infections before beginning medication with STRONGHOLD.
It is also recommended that dogs should be tested periodically for adult heartworm infections, as an integral part of a heartworm prevention strategy, even when Stronghold has been administered monthly.
This product is not effective against adult D. immitis.
Cats and dogs: treatment of ear mites (O. cynotis).
Cats: treatment of adult roundworms (Toxocara cati) and adult intestinal hookworms (Ancylostoma tubaeforme).
Cats: treatment of biting lice infestations (Felicola subrostratus)
Dogs: treatment of biting lice infestations (Trichodectes canis)
Dogs: treatment of sarcoptic mange (caused by S. scabiei).
Dogs: treatment of adult intestinal roundworms (Toxocara canis)
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in animals under 6 weeks of age.
Do not use in cats that are suffering from concomitant disease, or are debilitated and underweight (for size and age).
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
Animals may be bathed 2 hours after treatment without loss of efficacy.
For ear mite treatment, do not apply directly to the ear canal.
It is important to apply the dose as indicated to minimise the quantity that the animal can lick off.
If significant licking does occur, a brief period of hypersalivation may rarely be observed in cats.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
This product is to be applied to the skin surface only.
Do not administer orally or parenterally.
Do not apply when the animal’ s hair coat is wet.
However, shampooing or soaking the animal 2 or more hours after treatment will not reduce the efficacy of the product.
Do not allow treated animals to bathe in water courses until at least two hours after treatment administration.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Read package leaflet before use.
This product is highly flammable; keep away from heat, sparks, open flame or other sources of ignition.
3 Do not smoke, eat or drink while handling the product.
Wash hands after use and wash off any product in contact with the skin immediately with soap and water.
If accidental eye exposure occurs, flush the eyes immediately with water and seek medical attention.
Keep treated animals away from fires and other sources of ignition for at least 30 minutes or until the hair coat is dry.
Avoid direct contact with treated animals until the application area is dry.
Keep children away from treated animals for at least 30 minutes following application of the product or until the hair coat is dry.
People with sensitive skin or known allergy to products of this type should handle the product with caution.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Use of the product in cats has on rare occasions been associated with a mild transient alopecia at the site of application.
On very rare occasions transient focal irritation may also be observed.
The alopecia and irritation are normally self-resolving, but symptomatic therapy may be applicable in some circumstances.
On rare occasions, application of the product may produce a local temporary clumping of the hair at the application site and/ or an occasional appearance of a small quantity of a white powder.
This is normal and will disappear typically within 24 hours of treatment administration and does not affect either the safety or efficacy of the product.
Exceptionally, as with other macrocyclic lactones, reversible neurological signs have been observed after use of the product.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
STRONGHOLD can be used in breeding, pregnant and lactating cats and dogs.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In extensive field testing no interactions between STRONGHOLD and routinely used veterinary medicinal products or medical or surgical procedures were observed.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For external use only.
Apply topically to the skin at the base of the neck in front of the shoulder blades.
STRONGHOLD should be administered as a single topical application of a unit dose delivering a minimum of 6 mg/ kg selamectin.
When concurrent infestations or infections in the same animal are to be treated with the product, only one topical application of the recommended 6 mg/ kg dose should be administered at any one time.
The appropriate length of the treatment period for individual parasites is specified below.

0.25 0.25 0.5 1.0 2.0 Appropriate combination of tubes
Flea treatment and prevention (cats and dogs)
Following administration of the product, the adult fleas on the animal are killed, no viable eggs are produced, and larvae (found only in the environment) are also killed.
This stops flea reproduction, breaks the flea lifecycle and may aid in the control of existing environmental flea infestations in areas to which the animal has access.
For the prevention of flea infestations, the product should be administered at monthly intervals throughout the flea season, starting one month before fleas become active.
Through a reduction in the flea population, monthly treatment of pregnant and lactating animals will aid prevention of flea infestations in the litter up to seven weeks of age.
For use as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis the product should be administered at monthly intervals.
Prevention of heartworm disease (cats and dogs)
The product may be administered year-round or at least within one month of the animal’ s first exposure to mosquitoes and monthly thereafter until the end of the mosquito season.
The final dose must be given within one month after the last exposure to mosquitoes.
If a dose is missed and a monthly interval between dosing is exceeded then immediate administration of the product and resumption of monthly dosing will minimise the opportunity for the development of adult heartworms.
When replacing another heartworm preventive product in a heartworm disease prevention programme, the first dose of the product must be given within a month of the last dose of the former medication.
Treatment of roundworm infections (cats and dogs)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Treatment of biting lice (cats and dogs)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Treatment of ear mites (cats)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
5 Treatment of ear mites (dogs)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Loose debris should be gently removed from the external ear canal at each treatment.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Treatment of hookworm infections (cats)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Treatment of sarcoptic mange (dogs)
For complete elimination of the mites, a single dose of the product should be administered for two consecutive months.
Remove the STRONGHOLD tube from its protective package
Holding the tube upright, firmly depress the cap to puncture the applicator seal, then remove the cap
Part the hair at the base of your animal’ s neck in front of the shoulder blades to expose a small area of skin
Apply the tip of the STRONGHOLD tube directly to the skin without massaging.
Squeeze the tube firmly to empty the contents in one spot.
Avoid contact between the product and your fingers.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
STRONGHOLD was administered at 10 times the recommended dose, and no undesirable effects were observed.
The product was administered at 3 times the recommended dose to cats and dogs infected with adult heartworms and no undesirable effects were observed.
The product was also administered at 3 times the recommended dose to breeding male and female cats and dogs, including pregnant and lactating females nursing their litters and at 5 times the recommended dose to ivermectin-sensitive collies, and no undesirable effects were observed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: therapeutic antiparasitic agent, ATCvet code:
QP54A A05 selamectin
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Selamectin is a semi-synthetic compound of the avermectin class.
Selamectin paralyses and/ or kills a wide range of invertebrate parasites through interference with their chloride channel conductance causing disruption of normal neurotransmission.
This inhibits the electrical activity of nerve cells in nematodes and muscle cells in arthropods leading to their paralysis and/ or death.
Selamectin has adulticidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activity against fleas.
Therefore, it effectively breaks the flea life cycle by killing adults (on the animal), preventing the hatching of eggs (on the animal and in its environment) and by killing larvae (environment only).
Debris from selamectin- treated pets kills flea eggs and larvae not previously exposed to selamectin and thus may aid in the control of existing environmental flea infestations in areas to which the animal has access.
Activity has also been demonstrated againstheartworm larvae.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Following topical administration selamectin is absorbed from the skin reaching maximum plasma concentrations approximately 1 and 3 days after administration in cats and dogs respectively.
Following absorption from the skin selamectin distributes systemically and is slowly eliminated from plasma as manifested in detectable plasma concentrations in dogs and cats 30 days after administration of a single topical dose at 6 mg/ kg.
The prolonged persistence and slow elimination of selamectin from plasma is reflected in the terminal elimination half-life values of 8 and 11 days in cats and dogs respectively.
The systemic persistence of selamectin in plasma and the lack of extensive metabolism provide effective concentrations of selamectin for the duration of the inter-dosing interval (30 days).
5.3 Environmental properties
Selamectin may adversely affect fish or certain water-borne organisms on which they feed.
Containers and residual contents should be disposed of along with collected domestic refuse to avoid contamination of any water courses.

INDICATION(S)
Cats and dogs:
Treatment and prevention of flea infestations caused by Ctenocephalides spp. for one month following a single administration.
This is as a result of the adulticidal, larvicidal and ovicidal properties of the product.
The product is ovicidal for 3 weeks after administration.
Through a reduction in the flea population, monthly treatment of pregnant and lactating animals will also aid in the prevention of flea infestations in the litter up to seven weeks of age.
The product can be used as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis and through its ovicidal and larvicidal action may aid in the control of existing environmental flea infestations in areas to which the animal has access.
Prevention of heartworm disease caused by Dirofilaria immitis with monthly administration.
STRONGHOLD may be safely administered to animals infected with adult heartworms, however, it is recommended, in accordance with good veterinary practice, that all animals 6 months of age or more living in countries where a vector exists should be tested for existing adult heartworm infections before beginning medication with STRONGHOLD.
It is also recommended that dogs should be tested periodically for adult heartworm infections, as an integral part of a heartworm prevention strategy, even when Stronghold has been administered monthly.
This product is not effective against adult D. immitis.
Treatment of ear mites (Otodectes cynotis).
Cats:
Treatment of biting lice infestations (Felicola subrostratus) Treatment of adult roundworms (Toxocara cati) Treatment of adult intestinal hookworms (Ancylostoma tubaeforme).
Dogs:
Treatment of biting lice infestations (Trichodectes canis) Treatment of sarcoptic mange (caused by Sarcoptes. scabiei).
Treatment of adult intestinal roundworms (Toxocara canis)
5.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in animals under 6 weeks of age.
Do not use in cats that are suffering from concomitant disease, or are debilitated and underweight (for size and age).
6.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Use of the product in cats has on rare occasions been associated with a mild transient alopecia at the site of application.
On very rare occasions transient focal irritation may also be observed.
The alopecia and irritation are normally self-resolving, but symptomatic therapy may be applicable in some circumstances.
On rare occasions, application of the product may produce a local temporary clumping of the hair at the application site and/ or an occasional appearance of a small quantity of a white powder.
This is normal and will disappear typically within 24 hours of treatment administration and does not affect either the safety or efficacy of the product.
Exceptionally, as with other macrocyclic lactones, reversible neurological signs have been observed after use of the product.
40 It is important to apply the dose as indicated to minimise the quantity that the animal can lick off.
If significant licking does occur, a brief period of hypersalivation may rarely be observed in cats.
Other information
STRONGHOLD has been tested with no other adverse reactions in over 100 different pure and mixed breeds of dogs including collies, and in mixed breeds and 16 pure breeds of cats.
The product was administered at 10 times the recommended dose, and no undesirable effects were observed.
The product was administered at 3 times the recommended dose to cats and dogs infected with adult heartworms and no undesirable effects were observed.
The product was also administered at 3 times the recommended dose to breeding male and female cats and dogs, including pregnant and lactating females nursing their litters and at 5 times the recommended dose to ivermectin-sensitive collies, and no undesirable effects were observed.
In extensive field testing no interactions between the product and routinely used veterinary medicinal products or medical or surgical procedures were observed.
If you notice any other side effects, please inform your veterinary surgeon.

41 Flea treatment and prevention (cats and dogs)
Animals older than six weeks of age:
Following administration of the product to the animal, adult fleas and larvae are killed and no viable eggs are produced.
This stops flea reproduction and may aid in the control of existing environmental flea infestations in areas to which the animal has access.
For the prevention of flea infestations, the product should be administered to the animal at monthly intervals throughout the flea season, starting one month before fleas become active.
This ensures that fleas infesting the animal are killed, no viable flea eggs are produced by these fleas, and larvae (found only in the environment) are also killed.
This breaks the flea life cycle and prevents flea infestations.
For use as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis the product should be administered at monthly intervals.
Treatment of pregnant and lactating animals to prevent flea infestations in puppies and kittens:
Through a reduction in the flea population, monthly treatment of pregnant and lactating animals will aid prevention of flea infestation in the litter up to seven weeks of age.
Prevention of heartworm disease (cats and dogs)
The product may be administered year-round or at least within one month of the animal’ s first exposure to mosquitoes and monthly thereafter until the end of the mosquito season.
The final dose must be given within one month after the last exposure to mosquitoes.
If a dose is missed and a monthly interval between dosing is exceeded then immediate administration of the product and resumption of monthly dosing will minimise the opportunity for the development of adult heartworms.
When replacing another heartworm preventive product in a heartworm disease prevention programme, the first dose of the product must be given within a month of the last dose of the former medication.
Treatment of roundworm infections (cats and dogs)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Treatment of biting lice (cats and dogs)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Treatment of ear mites (cats)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Treatment of ear mites (dogs)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Loose debris should be gently removed from the external ear canal at each treatment.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Treatment of hookworm infections (cats)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
42 Treatment of sarcoptic mange (dogs)
For complete elimination of the mites, a single dose of the product should be administered for two consecutive months.
For external use only.
Apply topically to the skin at the base of the neck in front of the shoulder blades.
STRONGHOLD should be administered as a single topical application of a unit dose delivering a minimum of 6 mg/ kg selamectin.
When concurrent infestations or infections in the same animal are to be treated with the product, only one topical application of the recommended 6 mg/ kg dose should be administered at any one time.
The appropriate length of the treatment period for individual parasites is specified in section DOSAGE FOR EACH SPECIES.
9.
