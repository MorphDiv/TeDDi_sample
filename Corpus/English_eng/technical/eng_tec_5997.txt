POP3 Account
The server does not seem to support unique message numbers, but this is a requirement for leaving messages on the server. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn leaving fetched messages on the server on.
The server does not seem to support fetching message headers, but this is a requirement for filtering messages on the server. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn filtering messages on the server on.
Please note that this feature can cause some POP3 servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupted mail; this is configurable, though, because some servers support pipelining but do not announce their capabilities. To check whether your POP3 server announces pipelining support use the "Check What the Server Supports" button at the bottom of the dialog; if your server does not announce it, but you want more speed, then you should do some testing first by sending yourself a batch of mail and downloading it.
Please specify a server and port on the General tab first.
The server does not seem to support pipelining; therefore, this option has been disabled. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn pipelining on. But please note that this feature can cause some POP servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupt messages. So before using this feature with important mail you should first test it by sending yourself a larger number of test messages which you all download in one go from the POP server.
