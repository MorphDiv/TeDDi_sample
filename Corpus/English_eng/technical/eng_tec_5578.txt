Connection type:
Use this to specify the performance of your connection. Note that you should select the speed of the weakest link - even if you have a high speed connection, it will not help you if the remote computer uses a slow modem. Choosing a level of quality that is too high on a slow link will cause slower response times. Choosing a lower quality will increase latencies in high speed connections and results in lower image quality, especially in'Low Quality 'mode.
High Quality (LAN, direct connection)
Medium Quality (DSL, Cable, fast Internet)
Low Quality (Modem, ISDN, slow Internet)
