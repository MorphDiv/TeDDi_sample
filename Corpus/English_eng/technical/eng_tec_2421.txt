(PHP 4 = 4.0.4)
Opens a bzip2 (.bz2) file for reading or writing. filename is the name of the file to open. mode is similar to the fopen() function (`r 'for read, `w' for write, etc.).
If the open fails, the function returns FALSE, otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly opened file.
Example 1. bzopen() Example
?php $bz = bzopen( "/ tmp / foo.bz2", "r"); $decompressed_file = bzread($bz, filesize(" / tmp / foo.bz2")); bzclose($bz); print ("The contents of / tmp / foo.bz2 are:"); print ("\n br \n "); print ($decompressed_file);?
See also bzclose().
