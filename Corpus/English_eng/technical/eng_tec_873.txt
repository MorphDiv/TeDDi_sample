Copying Spreadsheet Areas to Text Documents
Open both the text document and the spreadsheet.
Select the sheet area you want to copy.
Point to the selected area and press the mouse button.
Keep the mouse button pressed for a moment, then drag the area into the text document.
If the documents are not visible next to each other, first drag the mouse pointer to the destination document button.
Continue to hold down the mouse button.
The document is displayed, and you can move the mouse pointer within the document.
Once the cursor is located in the place where you want to insert the sheet area, release the mouse button.
The sheet area is inserted as an OLE object.
You can select and edit the OLE object at any time.
To edit the OLE object, double-click on it.
Edit - Object - Edit
or choose
Edit
from the context menu.
You edit the object in its own frame within the text document, but you will see the icons and menu commands needed for spreadsheets.
Open
to open the source document of the OLE object.
