4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Vimpat is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Vimpat must be taken twice a day.
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.
Depending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 50 mg twice a day every week, to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg (200 mg twice a day).
Vimpat may be taken with or without food.
In accordance with current clinical practice, if Vimpat has to be discontinued, it is recommended this be done gradually (e. g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/ week).
Use in patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired patients (CLCR > 30 ml/ min).
A maximum dose of 250 mg/ day is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/ min) and in patients with endstage renal disease.
For patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to 50% of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended.
Treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience and accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).
In all patients with renal impairment, the dose titration should be performed with caution (see section 5.2).
Use in patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
The dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see section 5.2).
Use in elderly (over 65 years of age) No dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients.
The experience with lacosamide in elderly patients with epilepsy is limited.
Age associated decreased renal clearance with an increase in AUC levels
2 should be considered in elderly patients (see ‘ Use in patients with renal impairment’ above and section 5.2).
Paediatric patients Vimpat is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 16 as there is no data on safety and efficacy in these age groups.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanuts or soya or to any of the excipients.
Known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls.
Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8).
Prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies.
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems or severe cardiac disease such as a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.
Caution should especially be exerted when treating elderly patients as they may be at an increased risk of cardiac disorders or when lacosamide is used in combination with products known to be associated with PR prolongation.
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents in several indications.
A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials of anti-epileptic drugs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour.
The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for lacosamide.
Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered.
Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation (e. g. carbamazepine, lamotrigine, pregabalin) and in patients treated with class I antiarrhythmic drugs.
However, subgroup analysis did not identify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of carbamazepine or lamotrigine in clinical trials.
Data generally suggest that lacosamide has a low interaction potential.
In vitro studies indicate that the enzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 are not induced and that CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, and 2E1 are not inhibited by lacosamide at plasma concentrations observed in clinical trials.
An in vitro study indicated that lacosamide is not transported by P-glycoprotein in the intestine.
Lacosamide does not inhibit or induce the enzyme CYP2C19 in vivo.
In vitro studies indicate that lacosamide may be a weak inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4.
The clinical relevance of this is presently unknown.
An interaction study with carbamazepine does not indicate a marked inhibitory effect of lacosamide on CYP3A4 catalysed metabolism at therapeutic doses.
Strong enzyme inducers such as rifampicin or St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may moderately reduce the systemic exposure of lacosamide.
Therefore, starting or ending treatment with these enzyme inducers should be done with caution.
Antiepileptic drugs In interaction trials lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine
3 and valproic acid.
Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by carbamazepine and by valproic acid.
A population PK analysis estimated that concomitant treatment with other anti-epileptic drugs known to be enzyme inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, in various doses) decreased the overall systemic exposure of lacosamide by 25%.
Oral contraceptives In an interaction trial there was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.
Progesterone concentrations were not affected when the medicinal products were co-administered.
Others Interaction trials showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
There was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and metformin.
Omeprazole 40 mg q. d. increased the AUC of lacosamide by 19%.
The effect probably lacks clinical relevance.
Lacosamide did not affect the single-dose pharmacokinetics of omeprazole.
No data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available.
Lacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15%.
Therefore, clinically relevant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general For all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of women treated with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population.
In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/ or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.
Moreover, effective anti-epileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus.
Risk related to lacosamide There are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women.
Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embyrotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits at maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Lacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus).
If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this product should be carefully re-evaluated.
Lactation It is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk.
Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk.
For precautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Vimpat may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Vimpat treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.
Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of Vimpat on their ability to perform such activities.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials in 1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9% of patients randomized to lacosamide and 35.2% of patients randomized to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with
4 lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and diplopia.
They were usually mild to moderate in intensity.
Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose.
Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time.
Over all controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2% for patients randomized to lacosamide and 1.6% for patients randomized to placebo.
The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.
The table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval.
Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e. g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.
In epilepsy patients the incidence rate of reported first degree AV Block is uncommon, 0.7%, 0%, 0.5% and 0% for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, respectively.
No second or higher degree AV Block was seen in lacosamide treated patients.
The incidence rate for syncope is uncommon and did not differ between lacosamide treated epilepsy patients (0.1%) and placebo treated epilepsy patients (0.3%).
4.9 Overdose
There is limited clinical experience with lacosamide overdose in humans.
Clinical symptoms (dizziness and nausea) following doses of 1200 mg/ day were mainly related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal system and resolved with dose adjustments.
The highest reported overdose in the clinical development program for lacosamide was 12 g taken in conjunction with toxic doses of multiple other antiepileptic drugs.
The subject was initially comatose and then fully recovered without permanent sequelae.
There is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide.
Treatment of lacosamide overdose should include general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other antiepileptics, ATC code:
N03AX18 The active substance, lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a functionalised amino acid.
Mechanism of action The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effect in humans remains to be fully elucidated.
Two observations that may be of relevance for the observed therapeutic effects are:
In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes.
Further, lacosamide binds to collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a phosphoprotein which is mainly expressed in the nervous system and is involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth.
Pharmacodynamic effects Lacosamide protected against seizures in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary generalized seizures and delayed kindling development.
In non-clinical experiments lacosamide in combination with levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate or gabapentin showed synergistic or additive anticonvulsant effects.
Clinical experience The efficacy of Vimpat as adjunctive therapy at recommended doses (200 mg/ day, 400 mg/ day) was established in 3 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a 12-week maintenance period.
Vimpat 600 mg/ day was also shown to be effective in controlled adjunctive therapy trials, although the efficacy was similar to 400 mg/ day and patients were less likely to tolerate this dose because of CNS- and gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions.
Thus, the 600 mg/ day dose is not recommended.
The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/ day.
These trials, involving 1308 patients with a history of an average of 23 years of partial-onset seizures, were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide when administered concomitantly with 1-3 antiepileptic drugs in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation.
Overall the proportion of subjects with a 50% reduction in seizure frequency was 23%, 34%, and 40% for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/ day and lacosamide 400 mg/ day.
There are insufficient data regarding the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products to achieve monotherapy with lacosamide.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Lacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration.
The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%.
Following oral administration, the plasma concentration of unchanged lacosamide increases rapidly and reaches Cmax about 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose.
Vimpat tablets and oral syrup are bioequivalent.
Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption.
Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/ kg.
Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins.
Metabolism 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as drug and metabolites.
The metabolism of lacosamide has not been completely characterised.
The major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose) and its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30%.
A polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20% in urine, but was detected only in small amounts (0-2%) in human plasma of some subjects.
Small amounts (0.5-2%) of additional metabolites were found in the urine.
CYP2C19 is mainly responsible for the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite.
However, no
6 clinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in extensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a functional CYP2C19).
Furthermore an interaction trial with omeprazole (CYP2C19-inhibitor) demonstrated no clinically relevant changes in lacosamide plasma concentrations indicating that the importance of this pathway is minor.
No other enzymes have been identified to be involved in the metabolism of lacosamide.
The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is approximately 15% of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma.
This major metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.
Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation.
After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces.
The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours.
The pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability.
Following twice daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period.
The plasma concentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Gender Clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma concentrations of lacosamide.
Renal impairment The AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30% in mildly and moderately and 60% in severely renal impaired patients and patients with endstage renal disease requiring hemodialysis compared to healthy subjects, whereas cmax was unaffected.
Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis.
Following a 4-hour haemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50%.
Therefore dosage supplementation following haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2).
The exposure of the O-desmethyl metabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.
In absence of haemodialysis in patients with endstage renal disease, the levels were increased and continuously rising during the 24-hour sampling.
It is unknown whether the increased metabolite exposure in endstage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological activity of the metabolite has been identified.
Hepatic impairment Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50% higher AUCnorm).
The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced renal function in the studied subjects.
The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study was estimated to give a 20% increase in the AUC of lacosamide.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
Elderly (over 65 years of age) In a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and 50% increased compared to young men, respectively.
This is partly related to lower body weight.
The body weight normalized difference is 26 and 23%, respectively.
An increased variability in exposure was also observed.
The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in this study.
A general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only marginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human
7 exposure A safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetized dogs showed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure most likely due to a cardiodepressant action.
These transient changes started in the same concentration range as after maximum recommended clinical dosing.
In anesthetized dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/ kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, atrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen.
In the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at about 3 times the clinical exposure.
These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of hepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides.
Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were observed.
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an increase in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced live litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to systemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure.
Since higher exposure levels could not be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the embryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide.
Studies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/ or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier.

In epilepsy patients the incidence rate of reported first degree AV Block is uncommon, 0.7%, 0%, 0.5% and 0% for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, respectively.
No second or higher degree AV Block was seen in lacosamide treated patients.
The incidence rate for syncope is uncommon and did not differ between lacosamide treated epilepsy patients (0.1%) and placebo treated epilepsy patients (0.3%).
4.9 Overdose
There is limited clinical experience with lacosamide overdose in humans.
Clinical symptoms (dizziness and nausea) following doses of 1200 mg/ day were mainly related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal system and resolved with dose adjustments.
The highest reported overdose in the clinical development program for lacosamide was 12 g taken in conjunction with toxic doses of multiple other antiepileptic drugs.
The subject was initially comatose and then fully recovered without permanent sequelae.
There is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide.
Treatment of lacosamide overdose should include general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
13 Pharmacotherapeutic group: other antiepileptics, ATC code:
N03AX18 The active substance, lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a functionalised amino acid.
Mechanism of action The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effect in humans remains to be fully elucidated.
Two observations that may be of relevance for the observed therapeutic effects are:
In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes.
Further, lacosamide binds to collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a phosphoprotein which is mainly expressed in the nervous system and is involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth.
Pharmacodynamic effects Lacosamide protected against seizures in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary generalized seizures and delayed kindling development.
In non-clinical experiments lacosamide in combination with levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate or gabapentin showed synergistic or additive anticonvulsant effects.
Clinical experience The efficacy of Vimpat as adjunctive therapy at recommended doses (200 mg/ day, 400 mg/ day) was established in 3 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a 12-week maintenance period.
Vimpat 600 mg/ day was also shown to be effective in controlled adjunctive therapy trials, although the efficacy was similar to 400 mg/ day and patients were less likely to tolerate this dose because of CNS- and gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions.
Thus, the 600 mg/ day dose is not recommended.
The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/ day.
These trials, involving 1308 patients with a history of an average of 23 years of partial-onset seizures, were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide when administered concomitantly with 1-3 antiepileptic drugs in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation.
Overall the proportion of subjects with a 50% reduction in seizure frequency was 23%, 34%, and 40% for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/ day and lacosamide 400 mg/ day.
There are insufficient data regarding the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products to achieve monotherapy with lacosamide.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Lacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration.
The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%.
Following oral administration, the plasma concentration of unchanged lacosamide increases rapidly and reaches Cmax about 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose.
Vimpat tablets and oral syrup are bioequivalent.
Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption.
Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/ kg.
Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins.
Metabolism 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as drug and metabolites.
The metabolism of lacosamide has not been completely characterised.
The major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose) and its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30%.
A polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20% in urine, but was detected only in small amounts (0-2%) in human plasma of some subjects.
Small amounts (0.5-2%) of additional metabolites were found in the urine.
CYP2C19 is mainly responsible for the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite.
However, no clinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in
14 extensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a functional CYP2C19).
Furthermore an interaction trial with omeprazole (CYP2C19-inhibitor) demonstrated no clinically relevant changes in lacosamide plasma concentrations indicating that the importance of this pathway is minor.
No other enzymes have been identified to be involved in the metabolism of lacosamide.
The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is approximately 15% of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma.
This major metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.
Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation.
After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces.
The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours.
The pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability.
Following twice daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period.
The plasma concentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Gender Clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma concentrations of lacosamide.
Renal impairment The AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30% in mildly and moderately and 60% in severely renal impaired patients and patients with endstage renal disease requiring hemodialysis compared to healthy subjects, whereas cmax was unaffected.
Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis.
Following a 4-hour haemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50%.
Therefore dosage supplementation following haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2).
The exposure of the O-desmethyl metabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.
In absence of haemodialysis in patients with endstage renal disease, the levels were increased and continuously rising during the 24-hour sampling.
It is unknown whether the increased metabolite exposure in endstage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological activity of the metabolite has been identified.
Hepatic impairment Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50% higher AUCnorm).
The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced renal function in the studied subjects.
The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study was estimated to give a 20% increase in the AUC of lacosamide.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
Elderly (over 65 years of age) In a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and 50% increased compared to young men, respectively.
This is partly related to lower body weight.
The body weight normalized difference is 26 and 23%, respectively.
An increased variability in exposure was also observed.
The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in this study.
A general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only marginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human exposure
15 A safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetized dogs showed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure most likely due to a cardiodepressant action.
These transient changes started in the same concentration range as after maximum recommended clinical dosing.
In anesthetized dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/ kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, atrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen.
In the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at about 3 times the clinical exposure.
These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of hepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides.
Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were observed.
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an increase in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced live litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to systemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure.
Since higher exposure levels could not be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the embryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide.
Studies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/ or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Vimpat is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Vimpat must be taken twice a day.
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.
Depending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 50 mg twice a day every week, to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg (200 mg twice a day).
Vimpat may be taken with or without food.
In accordance with current clinical practice, if Vimpat has to be discontinued, it is recommended this be done gradually (e. g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/ week).
Use in patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired patients (CLCR > 30 ml/ min).
A maximum dose of 250 mg/ day is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/ min) and in patients with endstage renal disease.
For patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to 50% of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended.
Treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience and accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).
In all patients with renal impairment, the dose titration should be performed with caution (see section 5.2).
Use in patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
The dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see section 5.2).
Use in elderly (over 65 years of age) No dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients.
The experience with lacosamide in elderly patients with epilepsy is limited.
Age associated decreased renal clearance with an increase in AUC levels should be considered in elderly patients (see ‘ Use in patients with renal impairment’ above and section
18 5.2).
Paediatric patients Vimpat is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 16 as there is no data on safety and efficacy in these age groups.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanuts or soya or to any of the excipients.
Known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls.
Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8).
Prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies.
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems or severe cardiac disease such as a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.
Caution should especially be exerted when treating elderly patients as they may be at an increased risk of cardiac disorders or when lacosamide is used in combination with products known to be associated with PR prolongation.
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents in several indications.
A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials of anti-epileptic drugs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour.
The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for lacosamide.
Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered.
Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation (e. g. carbamazepine, lamotrigine, pregabalin) and in patients treated with class I antiarrhythmic drugs.
However, subgroup analysis did not identify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of carbamazepine or lamotrigine in clinical trials.
Data generally suggest that lacosamide has a low interaction potential.
In vitro studies indicate that the enzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 are not induced and that CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, and 2E1 are not inhibited by lacosamide at plasma concentrations observed in clinical trials.
An in vitro study indicated that lacosamide is not transported by P-glycoprotein in the intestine.
Lacosamide does not inhibit or induce the enzyme CYP2C19 in vivo.
In vitro studies indicate that lacosamide may be a weak inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4.
The clinical relevance of this is presently unknown.
An interaction study with carbamazepine does not indicate a marked inhibitory effect of lacosamide on CYP3A4 catalysed metabolism at therapeutic doses.
Strong enzyme inducers such as rifampicin or St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may moderately reduce the systemic exposure of lacosamide.
Therefore, starting or ending treatment with these enzyme inducers should be done with caution.
Antiepileptic drugs In interaction trials lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and valproic acid.
Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by carbamazepine and by
19 valproic acid.
A population PK analysis estimated that concomitant treatment with other anti-epileptic drugs known to be enzyme inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, in various doses) decreased the overall systemic exposure of lacosamide by 25%.
Oral contraceptives In an interaction trial there was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.
Progesterone concentrations were not affected when the medicinal products were co-administered.
Others Interaction trials showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
There was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and metformin.
Omeprazole 40 mg q. d. increased the AUC of lacosamide by 19%.
The effect probably lacks clinical relevance.
Lacosamide did not affect the single-dose pharmacokinetics of omeprazole.
No data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available.
Lacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15%.
Therefore, clinically relevant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general For all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of women treated with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population.
In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/ or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.
Moreover, effective anti-epileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus.
Risk related to lacosamide There are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women.
Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embyrotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits at maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Lacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus).
If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this product should be carefully re-evaluated.
Lactation It is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk.
Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk.
For precautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Vimpat may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Vimpat treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.
Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of Vimpat on their ability to perform such activities.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials in 1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9% of patients randomized to lacosamide and 35.2% of patients randomized to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and diplopia.
They were usually mild to
20 moderate in intensity.
Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose.
Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time.
Over all controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2% for patients randomized to lacosamide and 1.6% for patients randomized to placebo.
The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.
The table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval.
Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e. g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.
In epilepsy patients the incidence rate of reported first degree AV Block is uncommon, 0.7%, 0%, 0.5% and 0% for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, respectively.
No second or higher degree AV Block was seen in lacosamide treated patients.
The incidence rate for syncope is uncommon and did not differ between lacosamide treated epilepsy patients (0.1%) and placebo treated epilepsy patients (0.3%).
4.9 Overdose
There is limited clinical experience with lacosamide overdose in humans.
Clinical symptoms (dizziness and nausea) following doses of 1200 mg/ day were mainly related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal system and resolved with dose adjustments.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Vimpat is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Vimpat must be taken twice a day.
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.
Depending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 50 mg twice a day every week, to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg (200 mg twice a day).
Vimpat may be taken with or without food.
In accordance with current clinical practice, if Vimpat has to be discontinued, it is recommended this be done gradually (e. g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/ week).
Use in patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired patients (CLCR > 30 ml/ min).
A maximum dose of 250 mg/ day is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/ min) and in patients with endstage renal disease.
For patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to 50% of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended.
Treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience and accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).
In all patients with renal impairment, the dose titration should be performed with caution (see section 5.2).
Use in patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
The dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see section 5.2).
Use in elderly (over 65 years of age) No dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients.
The experience with lacosamide in elderly patients with epilepsy is limited.
Age associated decreased renal clearance with an increase in AUC levels should be considered in elderly patients (see ‘ Use in patients with renal impairment’ above and section
26 5.2).
Paediatric patients Vimpat is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 16 as there is no data on safety and efficacy in these age groups.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanuts or soya or to any of the excipients.
Known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls.
Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8).
Prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies.
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems or severe cardiac disease such as a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.
Caution should especially be exerted when treating elderly patients as they may be at an increased risk of cardiac disorders or when lacosamide is used in combination with products known to be associated with PR prolongation.
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents in several indications.
A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials of anti-epileptic drugs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour.
The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for lacosamide.
Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered.
Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation (e. g. carbamazepine, lamotrigine, pregabalin) and in patients treated with class I antiarrhythmic drugs.
However, subgroup analysis did not identify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of carbamazepine or lamotrigine in clinical trials.
Data generally suggest that lacosamide has a low interaction potential.
In vitro studies indicate that the enzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 are not induced and that CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, and 2E1 are not inhibited by lacosamide at plasma concentrations observed in clinical trials.
An in vitro study indicated that lacosamide is not transported by P-glycoprotein in the intestine.
Lacosamide does not inhibit or induce the enzyme CYP2C19 in vivo.
In vitro studies indicate that lacosamide may be a weak inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4.
The clinical relevance of this is presently unknown.
An interaction study with carbamazepine does not indicate a marked inhibitory effect of lacosamide on CYP3A4 catalysed metabolism at therapeutic doses.
Strong enzyme inducers such as rifampicin or St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may moderately reduce the systemic exposure of lacosamide.
Therefore, starting or ending treatment with these enzyme inducers should be done with caution.
Antiepileptic drugs In interaction trials lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and valproic acid.
Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by carbamazepine and by
27 valproic acid.
A population PK analysis estimated that concomitant treatment with other anti-epileptic drugs known to be enzyme inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, in various doses) decreased the overall systemic exposure of lacosamide by 25%.
Oral contraceptives In an interaction trial there was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.
Progesterone concentrations were not affected when the medicinal products were co-administered.
Others Interaction trials showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
There was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and metformin.
Omeprazole 40 mg q. d. increased the AUC of lacosamide by 19%.
The effect probably lacks clinical relevance.
Lacosamide did not affect the single-dose pharmacokinetics of omeprazole.
No data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available.
Lacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15%.
Therefore, clinically relevant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general For all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of women treated with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population.
In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/ or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.
Moreover, effective anti-epileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus.
Risk related to lacosamide There are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women.
Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embyrotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits at maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Lacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus).
If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this product should be carefully re-evaluated.
Lactation It is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk.
Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk.
For precautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Vimpat may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Vimpat treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.
Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of Vimpat on their ability to perform such activities.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials in 1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9% of patients randomized to lacosamide and 35.2% of patients randomized to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and diplopia.
They were usually mild to
28 moderate in intensity.
Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose.
Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time.
Over all controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2% for patients randomized to lacosamide and 1.6% for patients randomized to placebo.
The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.
The table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval.
Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e. g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.
In epilepsy patients the incidence rate of reported first degree AV Block is uncommon, 0.7%, 0%, 0.5% and 0% for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, respectively.
No second or higher degree AV Block was seen in lacosamide treated patients.
The incidence rate for syncope is uncommon and did not differ between lacosamide treated epilepsy patients (0.1%) and placebo treated epilepsy patients (0.3%).
4.9 Overdose
There is limited clinical experience with lacosamide overdose in humans.
Clinical symptoms (dizziness and nausea) following doses of 1200 mg/ day were mainly related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal system and resolved with dose adjustments.
The highest reported overdose in the clinical development program for lacosamide was 12 g taken in conjunction with toxic doses of multiple other antiepileptic drugs.
The subject was initially comatose and then fully recovered without permanent sequelae.
There is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide.
Treatment of lacosamide overdose should include general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
29 Pharmacotherapeutic group: other antiepileptics, ATC code:
N03AX18 The active substance, lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a functionalised amino acid.
Mechanism of action The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effect in humans remains to be fully elucidated.
Two observations that may be of relevance for the observed therapeutic effects are:
In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes.
Further, lacosamide binds to collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a phosphoprotein which is mainly expressed in the nervous system and is involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth.
Pharmacodynamic effects Lacosamide protected against seizures in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary generalized seizures and delayed kindling development.
In non-clinical experiments lacosamide in combination with levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate or gabapentin showed synergistic or additive anticonvulsant effects.
Clinical experience The efficacy of Vimpat as adjunctive therapy at recommended doses (200 mg/ day, 400 mg/ day) was established in 3 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a 12-week maintenance period.
Vimpat 600 mg/ day was also shown to be effective in controlled adjunctive therapy trials, although the efficacy was similar to 400 mg/ day and patients were less likely to tolerate this dose because of CNS- and gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions.
Thus, the 600 mg/ day dose is not recommended.
The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/ day.
These trials, involving 1308 patients with a history of an average of 23 years of partial-onset seizures, were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide when administered concomitantly with 1-3 antiepileptic drugs in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation.
Overall the proportion of subjects with a 50% reduction in seizure frequency was 23%, 34%, and 40% for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/ day and lacosamide 400 mg/ day.
There are insufficient data regarding the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products to achieve monotherapy with lacosamide.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Lacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration.
The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%.
Following oral administration, the plasma concentration of unchanged lacosamide increases rapidly and reaches Cmax about 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose.
Vimpat tablets and oral syrup are bioequivalent.
Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption.
Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/ kg.
Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins.
Metabolism 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as drug and metabolites.
The metabolism of lacosamide has not been completely characterised.
The major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose) and its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30%.
A polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20% in urine, but was detected only in small amounts (0-2%) in human plasma of some subjects.
Small amounts (0.5-2%) of additional metabolites were found in the urine.
CYP2C19 is mainly responsible for the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite.
However, no clinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in
30 extensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a functional CYP2C19).
Furthermore an interaction trial with omeprazole (CYP2C19-inhibitor) demonstrated no clinically relevant changes in lacosamide plasma concentrations indicating that the importance of this pathway is minor.
No other enzymes have been identified to be involved in the metabolism of lacosamide.
The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is approximately 15% of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma.
This major metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.
Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation.
After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces.
The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours.
The pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability.
Following twice daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period.
The plasma concentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Gender Clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma concentrations of lacosamide.
Renal impairment The AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30% in mildly and moderately and 60% in severely renal impaired patients and patients with endstage renal disease requiring hemodialysis compared to healthy subjects, whereas cmax was unaffected.
Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis.
Following a 4-hour haemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50%.
Therefore dosage supplementation following haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2).
The exposure of the O-desmethyl metabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.
In absence of haemodialysis in patients with endstage renal disease, the levels were increased and continuously rising during the 24-hour sampling.
It is unknown whether the increased metabolite exposure in endstage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological activity of the metabolite has been identified.
Hepatic impairment Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50% higher AUCnorm).
The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced renal function in the studied subjects.
The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study was estimated to give a 20% increase in the AUC of lacosamide.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
Elderly (over 65 years of age) In a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and 50% increased compared to young men, respectively.
This is partly related to lower body weight.
The body weight normalized difference is 26 and 23%, respectively.
An increased variability in exposure was also observed.
The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in this study.
A general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only marginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human exposure
31 A safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetized dogs showed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure most likely due to a cardiodepressant action.
These transient changes started in the same concentration range as after maximum recommended clinical dosing.
In anesthetized dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/ kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, atrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen.
In the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at about 3 times the clinical exposure.
These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of hepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides.
Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were observed.
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an increase in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced live litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to systemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure.
Since higher exposure levels could not be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the embryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide.
Studies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/ or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Vimpat is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Vimpat must be taken twice a day.
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.
Depending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 50 mg twice a day every week, to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg (200 mg twice a day).
Vimpat may be taken with or without food.
In accordance with current clinical practice, if Vimpat has to be discontinued, it is recommended this be done gradually (e. g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/ week).
Vimpat treatment initiation pack contains 4 different packages (one for each tablet strength) with 14
34 tablets each, for the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy depending on the patient´s response and tolerability.
The packages are marked with ‘ week 1 (2, 3 or 4 )’.
On the first day of treatment the patient starts with Vimpat 50 mg tablets twice a day.
During the second week, the patient takes Vimpat 100 mg tablets twice a day.
Depending on response and tolerability, Vimpat 150 mg tablets may be taken twice a day during the third week and Vimpat 200 mg tablets twice a day during the fourth week.
Use in patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired patients (CLCR > 30 ml/ min).
A maximum dose of 250 mg/ day is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/ min) and in patients with endstage renal disease.
For patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to 50% of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended.
Treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience and accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).
In all patients with renal impairment, the dose titration should be performed with caution (see section 5.2).
Use in patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
The dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see section 5.2).
Use in elderly (over 65 years of age) No dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients.
The experience with lacosamide in elderly patients with epilepsy is limited.
Age associated decreased renal clearance with an increase in AUC levels should be considered in elderly patients (see ‘ Use in patients with renal impairment’ above and section 5.2).
Paediatric patients Vimpat is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 16 as there is no data on safety and efficacy in these age groups.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanuts or soya or to any of the excipients.
Known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls.
Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8).
Prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies.
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems or severe cardiac disease such as a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.
Caution should especially be exerted when treating elderly patients as they may be at an increased risk of cardiac disorders or when lacosamide is used in combination with products known to be associated with PR prolongation.
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents in several indications.
A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials of anti-epileptic drugs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour.
The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for lacosamide.
Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered.
Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical
35 advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation (e. g. carbamazepine, lamotrigine, pregabalin) and in patients treated with class I antiarrhythmic drugs.
However, subgroup analysis did not identify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of carbamazepine or lamotrigine in clinical trials.

Omeprazole 40 mg q. d. increased the AUC of lacosamide by 19%.
The effect probably lacks clinical relevance.
Lacosamide did not affect the single-dose pharmacokinetics of omeprazole.
No data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available.
Lacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15%.
Therefore, clinically relevant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general For all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of women treated with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population.
In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/ or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.
Moreover, effective anti-epileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus.
36 Risk related to lacosamide There are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women.
Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embyrotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits at maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Lacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus).
If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this product should be carefully re-evaluated.
Lactation It is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk.
Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk.
For precautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Vimpat may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Vimpat treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.
Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of Vimpat on their ability to perform such activities.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials in 1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9% of patients randomized to lacosamide and 35.2% of patients randomized to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and diplopia.
They were usually mild to moderate in intensity.
Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose.
Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time.
Over all controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2% for patients randomized to lacosamide and 1.6% for patients randomized to placebo.
The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.
The table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval.
Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e. g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.
In epilepsy patients the incidence rate of reported first degree AV Block is uncommon, 0.7%, 0%, 0.5% and 0% for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, respectively.
No second or higher degree AV Block was seen in lacosamide treated patients.
The incidence rate for syncope is uncommon and did not differ between lacosamide treated epilepsy patients (0.1%) and placebo treated epilepsy patients (0.3%).
4.9 Overdose
There is limited clinical experience with lacosamide overdose in humans.
Clinical symptoms (dizziness and nausea) following doses of 1200 mg/ day were mainly related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal system and resolved with dose adjustments.
The highest reported overdose in the clinical development program for lacosamide was 12 g taken in conjunction with toxic doses of multiple other antiepileptic drugs.
The subject was initially comatose and then fully recovered without permanent sequelae.
There is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide.
Treatment of lacosamide overdose should include general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other antiepileptics, ATC code:
N03AX18 The active substance, lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a functionalised amino acid.
Mechanism of action The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effect in humans remains to be fully elucidated.
Two observations that may be of relevance for the observed therapeutic effects are:
In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes.
Further, lacosamide binds to collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a phosphoprotein which is mainly expressed in the nervous system and is involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth.
Pharmacodynamic effects Lacosamide protected against seizures in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary generalized seizures and delayed kindling development.
In non-clinical experiments lacosamide in combination with levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate or gabapentin showed synergistic or additive anticonvulsant effects.
Clinical experience The efficacy of Vimpat as adjunctive therapy at recommended doses (200 mg/ day, 400 mg/ day) was established in 3 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a 12-week maintenance period.
Vimpat 600 mg/ day was also shown to be effective in controlled adjunctive therapy trials, although the efficacy was similar to 400 mg/ day and patients were less likely to tolerate this dose because of CNS- and gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions.
Thus, the 600 mg/ day dose is not recommended.
The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/ day.
These trials, involving 1308 patients with a history of an average of 23 years of partial-onset seizures, were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide when administered concomitantly with 1-3 antiepileptic drugs in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation.
Overall the
38 proportion of subjects with a 50% reduction in seizure frequency was 23%, 34%, and 40% for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/ day and lacosamide 400 mg/ day.
There are insufficient data regarding the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products to achieve monotherapy with lacosamide.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Lacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration.
The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%.
Following oral administration, the plasma concentration of unchanged lacosamide increases rapidly and reaches Cmax about 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose.
Vimpat tablets and oral syrup are bioequivalent.
Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption.
Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/ kg.
Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins.
Metabolism 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as drug and metabolites.
The metabolism of lacosamide has not been completely characterised.
The major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose) and its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30%.
A polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20% in urine, but was detected only in small amounts (0-2%) in human plasma of some subjects.
Small amounts (0.5-2%) of additional metabolites were found in the urine.
CYP2C19 is mainly responsible for the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite.
However, no clinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in extensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a functional CYP2C19).
Furthermore an interaction trial with omeprazole (CYP2C19-inhibitor) demonstrated no clinically relevant changes in lacosamide plasma concentrations indicating that the importance of this pathway is minor.
No other enzymes have been identified to be involved in the metabolism of lacosamide.
The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is approximately 15% of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma.
This major metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.
Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation.
After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces.
The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours.
The pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability.
Following twice daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period.
The plasma concentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Gender Clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma concentrations of lacosamide.
Renal impairment The AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30% in mildly and moderately and 60% in severely renal impaired patients and patients with endstage renal disease requiring hemodialysis compared to healthy subjects, whereas cmax was unaffected.
Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis.
Following a 4-hour haemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50%.
Therefore dosage supplementation following haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2).
The exposure of the O-desmethyl metabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.
In
39 absence of haemodialysis in patients with endstage renal disease, the levels were increased and continuously rising during the 24-hour sampling.
It is unknown whether the increased metabolite exposure in endstage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological activity of the metabolite has been identified.
Hepatic impairment Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50% higher AUCnorm).
The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced renal function in the studied subjects.
The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study was estimated to give a 20% increase in the AUC of lacosamide.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
Elderly (over 65 years of age) In a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and 50% increased compared to young men, respectively.
This is partly related to lower body weight.
The body weight normalized difference is 26 and 23%, respectively.
An increased variability in exposure was also observed.
The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in this study.
A general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only marginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human exposure A safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetized dogs showed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure most likely due to a cardiodepressant action.
These transient changes started in the same concentration range as after maximum recommended clinical dosing.
In anesthetized dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/ kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, atrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen.
In the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at about 3 times the clinical exposure.
These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of hepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides.
Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were observed.
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an increase in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced live litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to systemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure.
Since higher exposure levels could not be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the embryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide.
Studies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/ or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Vimpat is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Vimpat syrup is provided with a measuring cup with graduation marks and instructions for use in the package leaflet.
Vimpat must be taken twice a day.
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.
Depending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 50 mg twice a day every week, to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg (200 mg twice a day).
Vimpat may be taken with or without food.
In accordance with current clinical practice, if Vimpat has to be discontinued, it is recommended this be done gradually (e. g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/ week).
Use in patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired patients (CLCR > 30 ml/ min).
A maximum dose of 250 mg/ day is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/ min) and in patients with endstage renal disease.
For patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to 50% of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended.
Treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience and accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).
In all patients with renal impairment, the dose titration should be performed with caution (see section 5.2).
Use in patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
The dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal
43 impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see section 5.2).
Use in elderly (over 65 years of age) No dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients.
The experience with lacosamide in elderly patients with epilepsy is limited.
Age associated decreased renal clearance with an increase in AUC levels should be considered in elderly patients (see ‘ Use in patients with renal impairment’ above and section 5.2).
Paediatric patients Vimpat is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 16 as there is no data on safety and efficacy in these age groups.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls.
Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8).
Prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies.
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems or severe cardiac disease such as a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.
Caution should especially be exerted when treating elderly patients as they may be at an increased risk of cardiac disorders or when lacosamide is used in combination with products known to be associated with PR prolongation.
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents in several indications.
A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials of anti-epileptic drugs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour.
The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for lacosamide.
Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered.
Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
Vimpat syrup contains sodium propylhydroxybenzoate (E217) and sodium methylhydroxybenzoate (E219), which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).
It contains 3.7 g sorbitol (E420) per dose (200 mg lacosamide), corresponding to a calorific value of 9.7 kcal.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine.
The syrup contains aspartame (E951), a source of phenylalanine, which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.
It contains 1.06 mmol (or 25.2 mg) sodium per dose (200 mg lacosamide).
To be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation (e. g. carbamazepine, lamotrigine, pregabalin) and in patients treated with class I antiarrhythmic drugs.
However, subgroup analysis did not identify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of carbamazepine or lamotrigine in clinical trials.
Data generally suggest that lacosamide has a low interaction potential.
In vitro studies indicate that the enzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 are not induced and that CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6,
44 and 2E1 are not inhibited by lacosamide at plasma concentrations observed in clinical trials.
An in vitro study indicated that lacosamide is not transported by P-glycoprotein in the intestine.
Lacosamide does not inhibit or induce the enzyme CYP2C19 in vivo.
In vitro studies indicate that lacosamide may be a weak inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4.
The clinical relevance of this is presently unknown.
An interaction study with carbamazepine does not indicate a marked inhibitory effect of lacosamide on CYP3A4 catalysed metabolism at therapeutic doses.
Strong enzyme inducers such as rifampicin or St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may moderately reduce the systemic exposure of lacosamide.
Therefore, starting or ending treatment with these enzyme inducers should be done with caution.
Antiepileptic drugs In interaction trials lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and valproic acid.
Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by carbamazepine and by valproic acid.
A population PK analysis estimated that concomitant treatment with other anti-epileptic drugs known to be enzyme inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, in various doses) decreased the overall systemic exposure of lacosamide by 25%.
Oral contraceptives In an interaction trial there was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.
Progesterone concentrations were not affected when the medicinal products were co-administered.
Others Interaction trials showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
There was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and metformin.
Omeprazole 40 mg q. d. increased the AUC of lacosamide by 19%.
The effect probably lacks clinical relevance.
Lacosamide did not affect the single-dose pharmacokinetics of omeprazole.
No data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available.
Lacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15%.
Therefore, clinically relevant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general For all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of women treated with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population.
In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/ or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.
Moreover, effective anti-epileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus.
Risk related to lacosamide There are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women.
Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embroytoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits at maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Lacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus).
If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this product should be carefully re-evaluated.
Lactation It is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk.
Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk.
For precautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide.
45 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Vimpat may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Vimpat treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.
Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of Vimpat on their ability to perform such activities.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials in 1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9% of patients randomized to lacosamide and 35.2% of patients randomized to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and diplopia.
They were usually mild to moderate in intensity.
Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose.
Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time.
Over all controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2% for patients randomized to lacosamide and 1.6% for patients randomized to placebo.
The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.
The table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval.
Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e. g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.
In epilepsy patients the incidence rate of reported first degree AV Block is uncommon, 0.7%, 0%, 0.5% and 0% for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, respectively.
No second or higher degree AV Block was seen in lacosamide treated patients.
The incidence rate for syncope is uncommon and did not differ between lacosamide treated epilepsy patients (0.1%) and placebo treated epilepsy patients (0.3%).
4.9 Overdose
46 There is limited clinical experience with lacosamide overdose in humans.
Clinical symptoms (dizziness and nausea) following doses of 1200 mg/ day were mainly related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal system and resolved with dose adjustments.
The highest reported overdose in the clinical development program for lacosamide was 12 g taken in conjunction with toxic doses of multiple other antiepileptic drugs.
The subject was initially comatose and then fully recovered without permanent sequelae.
There is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide.
Treatment of lacosamide overdose should include general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2).

Overall the proportion of subjects with a 50% reduction in seizure frequency was 23%, 34%, and 40% for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/ day and lacosamide 400 mg/ day.
There are insufficient data regarding the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products to achieve monotherapy with lacosamide.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Lacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration.
The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%.
Following oral administration, the plasma concentration of unchanged lacosamide increases rapidly and reaches Cmax about 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose.
Vimpat tablets and oral syrup are bioequivalent.
Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption.
47 Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/ kg.
Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins.
Metabolism 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as drug and metabolites.
The metabolism of lacosamide has not been completely characterised.
The major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose) and its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30%.
A polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20% in urine, but was detected only in small amounts (0-2%) in human plasma of some subjects.
Small amounts (0.5-2%) of additional metabolites were found in the urine.
CYP2C19 is mainly responsible for the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite.
However, no clinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in extensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a functional CYP2C19).

No other enzymes have been identified to be involved in the metabolism of lacosamide.
The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is approximately 15% of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma.
This major metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.
Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation.
After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces.
The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours.
The pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability.
Following twice daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period.
The plasma concentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Gender Clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma concentrations of lacosamide.
Renal impairment The AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30% in mildly and moderately and 60% in severely renal impaired patients and patients with endstage renal disease requiring hemodialysis compared to healthy subjects, whereas cmax was unaffected.
Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis.
Following a 4-hour haemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50%.
Therefore dosage supplementation following haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2).
The exposure of the O-desmethyl metabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.
In absence of haemodialysis in patients with endstage renal disease, the levels were increased and continuously rising during the 24-hour sampling.
It is unknown whether the increased metabolite exposure in endstage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological activity of the metabolite has been identified.
Hepatic impairment Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50% higher AUCnorm).
The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced renal function in the studied subjects.
The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study was estimated to give a 20% increase in the AUC of lacosamide.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
48 Elderly (over 65 years of age) In a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and 50% increased compared to young men, respectively.
This is partly related to lower body weight.
The body weight normalized difference is 26 and 23%, respectively.
An increased variability in exposure was also observed.
The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in this study.
A general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only marginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human exposure A safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetized dogs showed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure most likely due to a cardiodepressant action.
These transient changes started in the same concentration range as after maximum recommended clinical dosing.
In anesthetized dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/ kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, atrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen.
In the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at about 3 times the clinical exposure.
These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of hepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides.
Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were observed.
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an increase in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced live litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to systemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure.
Since higher exposure levels could not be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the embryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide.
Studies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/ or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Vimpat is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older.
Vimpat solution for infusion is an alternative for patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Vimpat must be administered twice a day.
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice a day which should be increased to an initial therapeutic dose of 100 mg twice a day after one week.
Depending on response and tolerability, the maintenance dose can be further increased by 50 mg twice a day every week, to a maximum recommended daily dose of 400 mg (200 mg twice a day).
In accordance with current clinical practice, if Vimpat has to be discontinued, it is recommended this be done gradually (e. g. taper the daily dose by 200 mg/ week).
Vimpat therapy can be initiated with either oral or i. v. administration.
The solution for infusion is infused over a period of 15 to 60 minutes twice daily.
Vimpat solution for infusion can be administered i. v. without further dilution.
Conversion to or from oral and i. v. administration can be done directly without titration.
The total daily dose and twice daily administration should be maintained.
There is experience with twice daily infusions of Vimpat up to 5 days.
Use in patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired patients (CLCR > 30 ml/ min).
A maximum dose of 250 mg/ day is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/ min) and in patients with endstage renal disease.
For patients requiring haemodialysis a supplement of up to 50% of the divided daily dose directly after the end of haemodialysis is recommended.
Treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease should be made with caution as there is little clinical experience and accumulation of a metabolite (with no known pharmacological activity).
In all patients with renal impairment, the dose titration should be performed with caution (see section 5.2).
51 Use in patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
The dose titration in these patients should be performed with caution considering co-existing renal impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severely hepatic impaired patients (see section 5.2).
Use in elderly (over 65 years of age) No dose reduction is necessary in elderly patients.
The experience with lacosamide in elderly patients with epilepsy is limited.
Age associated decreased renal clearance with an increase in AUC levels should be considered in elderly patients (see ‘ Use in patients with renal impairment’ above and section 5.2).
Paediatric patients Vimpat is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 16 as there is no data on safety and efficacy in these age groups.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls.
Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine (see section 4.8).
Prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies.
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems or severe cardiac disease such as a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure.
Caution should especially be exerted when treating elderly patients as they may be at an increased risk of cardiac disorders or when lacosamide is used in combination with products known to be associated with PR prolongation.
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic agents in several indications.
A meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials of anti-epileptic drugs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour.
The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for lacosamide.
Therefore patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered.
Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
This medicinal product contains 2.6 mmol (or 59.8 mg) sodium per vial.
To be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients treated with medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation (e. g. carbamazepine, lamotrigine, pregabalin) and in patients treated with class I antiarrhythmic drugs.
However, subgroup analysis did not identify an increased magnitude of PR prolongation in patients with concomitant administration of carbamazepine or lamotrigine in clinical trials.
Data generally suggest that lacosamide has a low interaction potential.
In vitro studies indicate that the enzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, and 2C9 are not induced and that CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, and 2E1 are not inhibited by lacosamide at plasma concentrations observed in clinical trials.
An in vitro study indicated that lacosamide is not transported by P-glycoprotein in the intestine.
Lacosamide
52 does not inhibit or induce the enzyme CYP2C19 in vivo.
In vitro studies indicate that lacosamide may be a weak inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4.
The clinical relevance of this is presently unknown.
An interaction study with carbamazepine does not indicate a marked inhibitory effect of lacosamide on CYP3A4 catalysed metabolism at therapeutic doses.
Strong enzyme inducers such as rifampicin or St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum) may moderately reduce the systemic exposure of lacosamide.
Therefore, starting or ending treatment with these enzyme inducers should be done with caution.
Antiepileptic drugs In interaction trials lacosamide did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and valproic acid.
Lacosamide plasma concentrations were not affected by carbamazepine and by valproic acid.
A population PK analysis estimated that concomitant treatment with other anti-epileptic drugs known to be enzyme inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, in various doses) decreased the overall systemic exposure of lacosamide by 25%.
Oral contraceptives In an interaction trial there was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.
Progesterone concentrations were not affected when the medicinal products were co-administered.
Others Interaction trials showed that lacosamide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
There was no clinically relevant interaction between lacosamide and metformin.
Omeprazole 40 mg q. d. increased the AUC of lacosamide by 19%.
The effect probably lacks clinical relevance.
Lacosamide did not affect the single-dose pharmacokinetics of omeprazole.
No data on the interaction of lacosamide with alcohol are available.
Lacosamide has a low protein binding of less than 15%.
Therefore, clinically relevant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are considered unlikely.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general For all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of women treated with epilepsy, the prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3% in the general population.
In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with polytherapy, however, the extent to which the treatment and/ or the illness is responsible has not been elucidated.
Moreover, effective anti-epileptic therapy must not be interrupted, since the aggravation of the illness is detrimental to both the mother and the foetus.
Risk related to lacosamide There are no adequate data from the use of lacosamide in pregnant women.
Studies in animals did not indicate any teratogenic effects in rats or rabbits, but embryotoxicity was observed in rats and rabbits at maternal toxic doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Lacosamide should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus).
If women decide to become pregnant, the use of this product should be carefully re-evaluated.
Lactation It is unknown whether lacosamide is excreted in human breast milk.
Animal studies have shown excretion of lacosamide in breast milk.
For precautionary measures, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with lacosamide.
53 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Vimpat may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Vimpat treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision.
Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of Vimpat on their ability to perform such activities.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials in 1,308 patients with partial-onset seizures, a total of 61.9% of patients randomized to lacosamide and 35.2% of patients randomized to placebo reported at least 1 adverse reaction.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and diplopia.
They were usually mild to moderate in intensity.
Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose.
Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time.
Over all controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2% for patients randomized to lacosamide and 1.6% for patients randomized to placebo.
The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness.
The table below shows the frequencies of adverse reactions which have been reported in pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval.
Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e. g. atrioventricular block, syncope, bradycardia) may occur.
In epilepsy patients the incidence rate of reported first degree AV Block is uncommon, 0.7%, 0%, 0.5% and 0% for lacosamide 200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or placebo, respectively.
No second or higher degree AV Block was seen in lacosamide treated patients.
The incidence rate for syncope is uncommon and did not differ between lacosamide treated epilepsy patients (0.1%) and placebo treated epilepsy patients (0.3%).
4.9 Overdose
54 There is limited clinical experience with lacosamide overdose in humans.
Clinical symptoms (dizziness and nausea) following doses of 1200 mg/ day were mainly related to the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal system and resolved with dose adjustments.
The highest reported overdose in the clinical development program for lacosamide was 12 g taken in conjunction with toxic doses of multiple other antiepileptic drugs.
The subject was initially comatose and then fully recovered without permanent sequelae.
There is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide.
Treatment of lacosamide overdose should include general supportive measures and may include haemodialysis if necessary (see section 5.2).
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other antiepileptics, ATC code:
N03AX18 The active substance, lacosamide (R-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide) is a functionalised amino acid.
Mechanism of action The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effect in humans remains to be fully elucidated.
Two observations that may be of relevance for the observed therapeutic effects are:
In vitro electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes.
Further, lacosamide binds to collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a phosphoprotein which is mainly expressed in the nervous system and is involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth.
Pharmacodynamic effects Lacosamide protected against seizures in a broad range of animal models of partial and primary generalized seizures and delayed kindling development.
In non-clinical experiments lacosamide in combination with levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate or gabapentin showed synergistic or additive anticonvulsant effects.
Clinical experience The efficacy of Vimpat as adjunctive therapy at recommended doses (200 mg/ day, 400 mg/ day) was established in 3 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a 12-week maintenance period.
Vimpat 600 mg/ day was also shown to be effective in controlled adjunctive therapy trials, although the efficacy was similar to 400 mg/ day and patients were less likely to tolerate this dose because of CNS- and gastrointestinal-related adverse reactions.
Thus, the 600 mg/ day dose is not recommended.
The maximum recommended dose is 400 mg/ day.
These trials, involving 1308 patients with a history of an average of 23 years of partial-onset seizures, were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide when administered concomitantly with 1-3 antiepileptic drugs in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation.
Overall the proportion of subjects with a 50% reduction in seizure frequency was 23%, 34%, and 40% for placebo, lacosamide 200 mg/ day and lacosamide 400 mg/ day.
There are insufficient data regarding the withdrawal of concomitant antiepileptic medicinal products to achieve monotherapy with lacosamide.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption After i. v. administration, Cmax is reached at the end of infusion.
The plasma concentration increases proportionally with dose after oral (100-800 mg) and i. v.
(50-300 mg) administration.
Distribution The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/ kg.
Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma
55 proteins.
Metabolism 95% of the dose is excreted in the urine as drug and metabolites.
The metabolism of lacosamide has not been completely characterised.
The major compounds excreted in urine are unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose) and its O-desmethyl metabolite less than 30%.
A polar fraction proposed to be serine derivatives accounted for approximately 20% in urine, but was detected only in small amounts (0-2%) in human plasma of some subjects.
Small amounts (0.5-2%) of additional metabolites were found in the urine.
CYP2C19 is mainly responsible for the formation of the O-desmethyl metabolite.
However, no clinically relevant difference in lacosamide exposure was observed comparing its pharmacokinetics in extensive metabolisers (EMs, with a functional CYP2C19) and poor metabolisers (PMs, lacking a functional CYP2C19).
Furthermore an interaction trial with omeprazole (CYP2C19-inhibitor) demonstrated no clinically relevant changes in lacosamide plasma concentrations indicating that the importance of this pathway is minor.
No other enzymes have been identified to be involved in the metabolism of lacosamide.
The plasma concentration of O-desmethyl-lacosamide is approximately 15% of the concentration of lacosamide in plasma.
This major metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.
Elimination Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation.
After oral and intravenous administration of radiolabeled lacosamide, approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces.
The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours.
The pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional and constant over time, with low intra- and inter-subject variability.
Following twice daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after a 3 day period.
The plasma concentration increases with an accumulation factor of approximately 2.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Gender Clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically significant influence on the plasma concentrations of lacosamide.
Renal impairment The AUC of lacosamide was increased by approximately 30% in mildly and moderately and 60% in severely renal impaired patients and patients with endstage renal disease requiring hemodialysis compared to healthy subjects, whereas cmax was unaffected.
Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by haemodialysis.
Following a 4-hour haemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50%.
Therefore dosage supplementation following haemodialysis is recommended (see section 4.2).
The exposure of the O-desmethyl metabolite was several-fold increased in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.
In absence of haemodialysis in patients with endstage renal disease, the levels were increased and continuously rising during the 24-hour sampling.
It is unknown whether the increased metabolite exposure in endstage renal disease subjects could give rise to adverse effects but no pharmacological activity of the metabolite has been identified.
Hepatic impairment Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50% higher AUCnorm).
The higher exposure was partly due to a reduced renal function in the studied subjects.
The decrease in non-renal clearance in the patients of the study was estimated to give a 20% increase in the AUC of lacosamide.
The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).
Elderly (over 65 years of age) In a study in elderly men and women including 4 patients > 75 years of age, AUC was about 30 and
56 50% increased compared to young men, respectively.
This is partly related to lower body weight.
The body weight normalized difference is 26 and 23%, respectively.
An increased variability in exposure was also observed.
The renal clearance of lacosamide was only slightly reduced in elderly subjects in this study.
A general dose reduction is not considered to be necessary unless indicated due to reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In the toxicity studies, the plasma concentrations of lacosamide obtained were similar or only marginally higher than those observed in patients, which leaves low or non-existing margins to human exposure A safety pharmacology study with intravenous administration of lacosamide in anesthetized dogs showed transient increases in PR interval and QRS complex duration and decreases in blood pressure most likely due to a cardiodepressant action.
These transient changes started in the same concentration range as after maximum recommended clinical dosing.
In anesthetized dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys, at intravenous doses of 15-60 mg/ kg, slowing of atrial and ventricular conductivity, atrioventricular block and atrioventricular dissociation were seen.
In the repeated dose toxicity studies, mild reversible liver changes were observed in rats starting at about 3 times the clinical exposure.
These changes included an increased organ weight, hypertrophy of hepatocytes, increases in serum concentrations of liver enzymes and increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides.
Apart from the hypertrophy of hepatocytes, no other histopathologic changes were observed.
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits, no teratogenic effects but an increase in numbers of stillborn pups and pup deaths in the peripartum period, and slightly reduced live litter sizes and pup body weights were observed at maternal toxic doses in rats corresponding to systemic exposure levels similar to the expected clinical exposure.
Since higher exposure levels could not be tested in animals due to maternal toxicity, data are insufficient to fully characterise the embryofetotoxic and teratogenic potential of lacosamide.
Studies in rats revealed that lacosamide and/ or its metabolites readily crossed the placental barrier.

Further information
1.
WHAT VIMPAT IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Vimpat is used to treat a certain form of epilepsy (see below) in patients aged 16 years and older.
Vimpat is used in addition to other antiepileptic medicines.
Epilepsy is a condition where the patients have repeated fits (seizures).
Vimpat is used for the epilepsy form in which the fits initially affect only one side of the brain, but could thereafter extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain (partial onset seizure with or without secondary generalisation).
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE VIMPAT
Do NOT take Vimpat • if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to lacosamide, or to peanuts or soya or any of the other ingredients of Vimpat (listed in Section 6).
If you are not sure whether you are allergic, please discuss with your doctor • if you suffer from a certain type of heart rhythm disorder (second or third degree AV block)
Take special care with Vimpat Please inform your doctor about the following: • if you are taking any medicine which can cause an abnormality on the ECG (electrocardiogram) called increased PR interval, for example medicines used to treat certain types of irregular heart beat or heart failure.
If you are not sure if the medicines you are taking could have this effect, discuss this with your doctor. • if you suffer from a severe heart disease such as heart rhythm disorder, heart failure or heart attack
Vimpat may cause dizziness, which could increase the risk of accidental injury or a fall.
Therefore, you should be careful until you are used to the effects this medicine might have.
104 A small number of people being treated with anti-epileptics such as lacosamide have had thoughts of harming or killing themselves.
If at any time you have these thoughts, immediately contact your doctor.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
This is especially important if you take medicines to treat heart problems (see also above "Take special care").
Taking Vimpat with food and drink You may take Vimpat with or without food.
It is not advisable to drink alcohol while you are under treatment with Vimpat, because Vimpat could make you feel tired or dizzy.
Drinking alcohol could make these effects worse.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding It is not recommended to take Vimpat if you are pregnant, as the effects of Vimpat on pregnancy and the unborn baby are not known.
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant; he/ she will decide if you should take Vimpat.
It is not recommended to breast-feed your baby while taking Vimpat, as it is not known if Vimpat passes into the breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, please inform your doctor immediately; he/ she will decide if you should take Vimpat.
Research has shown an increased risk of birth defects in children of women taking anti-epileptic medicines.
On the other hand effective anti-epileptic therapy must not be interrupted since the worsening of the disease is harmful to both the mother and the unborn child.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines Vimpat may cause dizziness or blurred vision.
This may affect your ability to drive or operate any tools or machinery.
You should not drive or use machines until you know whether this medicine affects your ability to perform these activities.
