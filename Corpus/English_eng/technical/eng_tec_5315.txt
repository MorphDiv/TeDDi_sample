The bzip2 functions are used to transparently read and write bzip2 (.bz2) compressed files.
This module uses the functions of the bzip2 library by Julian Seward.
This module requires bzip2 / libbzip2 version = 1.0.x.
Bzip2 support in PHP is not enabled by default.
You will need to use the --with-bz2[ =DIR] configuration option when compiling PHP to enable bzip2 support.
This extension has no configuration directives defined in php.ini.
This extension defines one resource type: a file pointer identifying the bz2-file to work on.
This extension has no constants defined.
This example opens a temporary file and writes a test string to it, then prints out the contents of the file.
Example 1.
Small bzip2 Example
?php $filename = "/ tmp / testfile.bz2"; $str = "This is a test string.\n"; / / open file for writing $bz = bzopen($filename, "w"); / / write string to file bzwrite($bz, $str); / / close file bzclose($bz); / / open file for reading $bz = bzopen($filename, "r"); / / read 10 characters print bzread($bz, 10); / / output until end of the file (or the next 1024 char) and close it. print bzread($bz); bzclose($bz);?
