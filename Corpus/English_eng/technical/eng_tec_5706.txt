Structure Group Editor
& Name:
The name of the group
The user visible name of the group. It will be shown in the structure tree as a top node when there are elements belonging to this group in the document.
& Icon:
Regular expression to get the filename
Regular expression to get the filename. The expression is used to remove the unnecessary strings from the element's text.
Filename definition:
True if the element's text contains a filename
Contains a & filename
Elements identified by this entry will belong to this group
Defines which tags belong to this group. The format is tagname(attribute1, attribute2,...). Tags with name tagname will appear under this group. The item text of the corresponding node in the tree will be attribute1_value | attribute2_value |... Currently only one tag may be listed here.
& Tag:
The name that appears when no element were found
The user visible name of the group. It will be shown in the structure tree as a top node when there are no elements belonging to this group in the document.
"No" name:
Treat elements as new tags
Treat elements as new tags, so they will show up during tag autocompletion.
Use elements as tags
& Pseudo DTEP Specific Settings
Regular expression to find the type of the element
Regular expression to find the type of the element. The pattern is searched on the result of the DefinitionRx match and the first captured area will hold the element type. Example (simplified): DefinitionRx=\\$+([a-zA-Z]+)=new\\\\s[a-zA-Z]+; TypeRx=new\\\\s([a-zA-Z]+); This will match strings like $fooObj=new foo;. Now this string is searched and it will find new foo;, where foo is the first captured text (the regular expression matching foo is between brackets). So the type of $fooObj is foo.
Regular expression to find the usage of a group element
Regular expression to find the usage of a group element in the document. Example 1: - classes are defined as class foo {...} - classes are used as $objFoo Example 2: - variables are defined as int i - variables are used as @i Example 3: - variables are defined as $i - variables are used as $i. In this case UsageRx is the same as DefinitionRx.
& Usage expression:
Element type expression:
Regular expression to find what belong to this group
Regular expression used to find text areas in the document, which will belong to this group. The first captured area shouldbe the actual name of the group entry. Example for a class group: \\bclass[\\\\s]+([0-9a-zA-Z_\\x7f-\\xff]*)[\\\\s]* The first captured area (between "(" and ")") holds the class name.
Definition expression:
The name of the group that may be the parent of this
The name of the group that may be the parent of this. For example classes might be a parent of functions in case of member functions. This entry indicates this possible relationship and is used to provide functionality like member autocompletion.
Parent group:
Only tags of this type can be part of the group
Searched tags:
Regular expression used to remove unwanted strings from the completion text
Remove when autocompleting:
Regular expression to tell when to bring up the completion box with the elements of this group
Regular expression to tell when to bring up the completion box with the elements of this group. Example: \\bnew[\\\\s]+$ tells that after typing newnbsp;, the completion box with the elements should be shown.

DOCTYPE string:
Check if the DTEP can act as a top level DTEP.
Check if the DTEP can act as a top level DTEP. This means that the document can be of this type. Some pseudo DTEPs cannot act as a top level DTEP, like PHP as they are always included as part of another DTEP, while some others can be included and act as standalone as well, like the case of CSS.

Check it to append common parsing rules. These are: & nbsp; nbsp; SpecialAreas=lt; ?xml? gt;, & lt; !-- --gt;, & lt;! & gt; & nbsp; nbsp; SpecialAreaNames = XML PI, comment, DTD & nbsp; nbsp; Comments = & lt; !-- --gt;
Use common rules
Check if the booleans are stored in extended form
Check if you want extended booleans in the language. Examples: Simple boolean: lt; tagnbsp; booleanAttrgt; Extended boolean: lt; tagnbsp; booleanAttr="1"gt; or lt; tagnbsp; booleanAttr="true"gt;. See the True and False boxes to define the values for true and false.

True:
Comma-separated list of the beginning and closing string for special areas
The beginning and closing string of special areas, separated by a comma. Special areas are not parsed according to this DTD's rules, but according to their own rules. A special area can be a pseudo DTD, a comment or something like that, for example lt; !--nbsp; --gt;.
Special areas:
Comma-separated list of the names for the above-defined special areas
Special area names:
Specifies a tag that defines the start of a special area
Specifies a tag which defines the start of a special area in the form of tagname(attributename). Example: script(language) means that any lt; scriptgt; tag having a language attribute indicates a special area.
Special tags:
Tags and attributes defining this DTEP
Comma-separated list of tags that define this DTEP. The format used is tagname(attribute[defaultvalue]). If the parent (a real) DTEP has a tag with tagname and the attribute value of this tag is equal with the name of this DTEP, the tag area is parsed according to the rules of this DTEP. If [defaultvalue] is present, it means that if the attribute is not present in the tag it is taken as present with value = defaultvalue. Example: Tags=style(type[text/ css]) means that both lt; stylegt; and lt; stylenbsp; type="text/ css"gt; are treated the same way and the DTEP defined by this tag is named text/ css.
Definition tags:
Comma-separated list of the area borders
Comma-separated list of the area borders encapsulating this pseudo DTEP. In the case of PHP it is: lt; ?nbsp; ?gt;, nbsp; lt; *nbsp; *gt;, nbsp; lt; %nbsp; %gt;
Area borders:
Comma-separated list of structure keywords
Comma-separated list of structure keywords. The keywords used here are used to create new node (nodes for structures) in the structure tree, like for a function, class or if block.
Structure keywords:
Regular expression that finds the beginning or end of a structure
Regular expression that finds the beginning or end of a structure. This is usually the combination of Structure beginning and Structure end, like \\\\{nbsp; |nbsp;\\\\}
Structure delimiting:
A string specifying the beginning of a structure
A string specifying the beginning of a structure, like {in many cases.
Structure beginning:
Comma-separated list of the local scope defining keywords
Comma-separated list of the local scope defining keywords. Other structure group elements found under a structure node that was created based on a keyword from this list are treated as local elements. For example if this list contains function, it means that elements, like variables found under a function are local, relative to the node that holds the function.
Local scope keywords:
A string specifying the end of a structure
A string specifying the end of a structure, like} in many cases.
Structure end:
Regular expression to find out when to invoke member autocompletion
Regular expression to find out when to invoke member autocompletion. Example: - we have a class called foo with some member variables - the object of type foo is used in the document as $objFoo - the members can appear as $objFoo- > member or $objFoo. member - in the above case this entry should look like (?: -gt; |\\. )$ (autocomplete if the object is followed by -gt; or.) The regular expression must be terminated with $(match end of line).
Complete class members after:
Autocomplete attributes after this character. See the information for the same entry valid for tags.
Complete attributes after:
The character specifying the end of an attribute
The character specifying the end of an attribute. By default it is "for XML DTEPs and, for pseudo DTEPs.
Attribute separator:
Comma-separated list of DTEPs that can be present inside this DTEP
Comma-separated list of DTEPs that can be present inside this DTEP. The list consist usually of pseudo DTEPs.
Included DTEPs:
The character after which the list of tags should be shown
The autocompletion box is brought up automatically once this character is entered or space is pressed after this character. For real DTEPs it is usually lt;, but for example for the CSS pseudo DTEP it is {. The text none instead of a character specifies that the tag completion box should not be brought up automatically, only if the user requests it.
Autocomplete tags after:
The character specifying the end of a tag. See the information for the attribute separator for details.

About
Quanta Plus Submitter Info Files The purpose of these files is to provide developers with proper credit, expose licensing information and give users thumbnail information about scripts and templates at a glance. We ask that you try to do several things here. Fill in all the fields. They are all there for a reason. Contact the appropriate Quanta script and template maintainer or a member of our team when you have new releases so we can include them. As we plan to build a huge repository we have to rely on you here. The additional information serves as a backup. Any time a user wants they can click the link to go to your site and get updates, docs or whatever they require.
