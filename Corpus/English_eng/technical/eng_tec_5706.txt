Description
& kmplot; is a mathematical function plotter for & kde;. It has a powerful built-in parser. You can plot different functions simultaneously and combine them to build new functions.
& kmplot; supports parametric functions and functions in polar coordinates. Several grid modes are supported. Plots may be printed with high precision in the correct scale.
& kmplot; also provides some numerical and visual features, like filling and calculating the area between the plot and the first axis, finding maximum and minimum values, changing function parameters dynamically and plotting derivatives and integral functions.
& kmplot; is part of the & kde; edutainment module.
