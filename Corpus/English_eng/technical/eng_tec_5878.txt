Insert Command
Anders Lund
& Anders. Lund. mail;
2006-05-17 3.5.2
The Insert Command plugin allows you to insert shell command output into a document open in & kate;.
KDE
kate
insert
Introduction
First enable the Insert Command plugin by using the Settings Configure & kate;... dialog and checking kate; InsertCommand in the Application Plugins section and close the dialog.
Onscreen Fundamentals
To use the plugin, select Insert Command... from the Tools menu, which will present you with a small dialog for entering the command, choosing a working folder and selecting whether to include errors (STDERR output) in the inserted text. You can also have the command string printed above the output.
The Insert Command Dialog
The plugin can remember a number of commands as chosen in the configuration page. These are used for autocompletion, and can be selected from a list in the command entry.
By default, the command will be run in the working folder of the kate process, which is usually your home folder. This can be changed in the configuration page for the plugin.
Note that any shell command that requires user input (for example passwd) or uses a ncurses interface or something similar (for example top) will fail to produce the expected output.
Configuration
To configure the Insert Command plugin, open the & kate; configuration dialog from the Settings Configure & kate;... menu and choose Plugins Insert Command.
The Insert Command Configuration Tab
The following configuration options are available:
Number of commands to remember
This setting is presented as a spinbox which you can set to the number of commands to be remembered. Any number from 0 to 99 is legal. Default is 20.
Default Working Folder
This setting, presented as a set of radio buttons, allows you to decide how the working folder of a command is chosen. The options are the working folder of the & kate; process (usually your home folder when & kate; is started from the K menu), the folder of the document (if any, otherwise the above option is used) or the working folder of the last command run in the plugin.
