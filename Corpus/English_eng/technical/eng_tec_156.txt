Formula Bar
Shows or hides the Formula Bar, which is used for entering and editing formulae.
The Formula Bar is the most important tool when working with spreadsheets.
To hide the Formula Bar, unmark the menu item.
If the Formula Bar is hidden, you can still edit cells by activating the edit mode with F2.
After editing cells, accept the changes by pressing Enter, or discard entries by pressing Esc.
Esc is also used to exit the edit mode.
