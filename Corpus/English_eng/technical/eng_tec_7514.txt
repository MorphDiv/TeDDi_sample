For cats suffering from, or at risk from, mixed parasitic infections caused by roundworms and tapeworms of the following species:
Roundworms (Nematodes) Toxocara cati (mature adult, immature adult, L4 and L3) Toxascaris leonina (mature adult, immature adult and L4) Ancylostoma tubaeforme (mature adult, immature adult and L4)
2 Tapeworms (Cestodes) Dipylidium caninum (adult) Taenia taeniaeformis (adult) Echinococcus multilocularis (adult)
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in kittens under 8 weeks of age or weighing less than 0.5 kg.
4.4 Special warnings
Shampooing or immersion of the animal in water directly after treatment may reduce the efficacy of the product.
Treated animals therefore should not be bathed until the solution has dried.
Parasite resistance to any particular class of anthelmintic may develop following frequent, repeated use of an anthelmintic of that class.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Apply only to the skin surface and on intact skin.
Do not administer orally or parenterally.
Avoid the treated cat or other cats in the household licking the site of application while it is wet.
There is limited experience on the use of the product in sick and debilitated animals, thus the product should only be used based on a benefit-risk assessment for these animals.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Read the package leaflet before use.
Do not smoke, eat or drink during application.
Avoid direct contact with application area while it is wet.
Keep children away from treated animals during that time.
Wash hands after use.
In case of accidental spillage onto skin, wash off immediately with soap and water.
If the product accidentally gets into eyes, they should be thoroughly flushed with plenty of water.
If skin or eye symptoms persist, or in case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Care should be taken not to allow children to have prolonged intensive contact (for example, by sleeping) with treated cats during the first 24 hours after application of the product.
Frequent users of the product (for example, veterinarians, professional cat breeders) should wear disposable gloves when administering the product.
Although the product was well tolerated by pregnant cats, studies performed in rats and rabbits suggest that emodepside may interfere with embryo-foetal development.
Therefore, women of child- bearing potential should avoid contact with, or wear disposable gloves when administering, the product.
The solvent in this product may stain certain materials including leather, fabrics, plastics and finished surfaces.
Allow the application site to dry before permitting contact with such materials.
Echinococcosis represents a hazard for humans.
As Echinococcosis is a notifiable disease to the OIE, specific guidelines on the treatment and follow-up, and on the safeguard of persons, need to be obtained from the relevant competent authority.
3 4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Salivation and vomiting may occur in very rare cases.
This is thought to occur as a result of the cat licking the application site immediately after treatment.
In very rare cases following administration of Profender transient alopecia, pruritus and/ or inflammation were observed at the application site.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Can be used during pregnancy and lactation.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Emodepside is a substrate for P-glycoprotein.
Co-treatment with other drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates/ inhibitors (for example, ivermectin and other antiparasitic macrocyclic lactones, erythromycin, prednisolone and cyclosporine) could give rise to pharmacokinetic drug interactions.
The potential clinical consequences of such interactions have not been investigated.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Dosage and Treatment Schedule
The recommended minimum doses are 3 mg emodepside / kg body weight and 12 mg praziquantel / kg body weight, equivalent to 0.14 ml Profender / kg body weight.

Use an appropriate combination of pipettes
A single administration per treatment is effective.
Method of administration
For external use only.
Remove one pipette from package.
Hold pipette in upright position, twist and pull off cap and use the opposite end of the cap to break the seal.
Part the fur on the cat’ s neck at the base of the skull until the skin is visible.
Place the tip of the pipette on the skin and squeeze firmly several times to empty the contents directly onto the skin.
Application on the base of the skull will minimise the ability of the cat to lick the product off.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Salivation, vomiting and neurological signs (tremor) were observed occasionally when the product was administered at up to 10 times the recommended dose in adult cats and up to 5 times the recommended dose in kittens.
These symptoms were thought to occur as a result of the cat licking the application site.
The symptoms were completely reversible.
There is no known specific antidote.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Not applicable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: therapeutic antiparasitic agent; ATCvet code:
QP52AA51.
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Emodepside is a semi-synthetic compound belonging to the new chemical group of depsipeptides.
It is active against roundworms (ascarids and hookworms).
In this product, emodepside is responsible for the efficacy against Toxocara cati, Toxascaris leonina, and Ancylostoma tubaeforme.
It acts at the neuromuscular junction by stimulating presynaptic receptors belonging to the secretin receptor family which results in paralysis and death of the parasites.
Praziquantel is a pyrazinoisoquinoline derivative effective against tapeworms such as Dipylidium caninum, Echinococcus multilocularis, and Taenia taeniaeformis.
Praziquantel is rapidly adsorbed via the surface of the parasites and acts primarily by changing the Ca++ permeability of the parasite membranes.
This results in severe damage to the parasite integument, contraction and paralysis, disruption of metabolism and finally leads to the death of the parasite.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
After topical application of this product to cats at the minimum therapeutic dose of 0.14 ml/ kg bodyweight, mean maximum serum concentrations of 32.2 ± 23.9 µg emodepside/ l and 61.3 ± 44.1 µg praziquantel/ l were observed.
Maximum concentrations were reached for emodepside 3.2 ± 2.7 days after application and 18.7 ± 47 hours for praziquantel.
Both active substances are then slowly eliminated from the serum with a half-life of 9.2 ± 3.9 days for emodepside and 4.1 ± 1.5 days for praziquantel.
After oral application in the rat, emodepside is distributed to all organs.
Highest concentration levels are found in the fat.
Faecal excretion predominates with unchanged emodepside and hydroxylated derivatives as the major excretion products.
Studies in many different species show that praziquantel is rapidly metabolised in the liver.
The main metabolites are monohydroxycyclohexyl derivatives of praziquantel.
Renal elimination predominates.
5.3 Environmental properties

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: therapeutic antiparasitic agent; ATCvet code:
QP52AA51.
14 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Emodepside is a semi-synthetic compound belonging to the new chemical group of depsipeptides.
It is active against roundworms (ascarids, hookworms and whipworms).
In this product, emodepside is responsible for the efficacy against Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala and Trichuris vulpis.
It acts at the neuromuscular junction by stimulating presynaptic receptors belonging to the secretin receptor family which results in paralysis and death of the parasites.
Praziquantel is a pyrazinoisoquinoline derivative effective against tapeworms such as Dipylidium caninum, Taenia spp., Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus.
Praziquantel is rapidly adsorbed via the surface of the parasites and acts primarily by changing the calcium (Ca++) permeability of the parasite membranes.
This results in severe damage to the parasite integument, contraction and paralysis, disruption of metabolism and finally leads to the death of the parasite.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
After treatment with a dose of 1.5 mg emodepside and 7.5 mg praziquantel per kg bodyweight, geometric mean maximum plasma concentrations of 47 µg emodepside/l and 593 µg praziquantel/l were observed.
Maximum concentrations were reached 2 hours after treatment for both active substances.
Both active substances were then eliminated from the plasma with a half-life of 1.4 to 1.7 hours.
After oral application in the rat, emodepside is distributed to all organs.
Highest concentration levels are found in the fat.
Unchanged emodepside and hydroxylated derivatives are the major excretion products.
The excretion of emodepside has not been investigated in dogs.
Studies in many different species show that praziquantel is rapidly metabolised in the liver.
The main metabolites are monohydroxycyclohexyl derivatives of praziquantel.
Renal excretion of metabolites predominates.

ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
Remove one pipette from package.
Hold pipette in upright position, twist and pull off cap and use the opposite end of the cap to break the seal.
Part the fur on the cat’s neck at the base of the skull until the skin is visible.
Place the tip of the pipette on the skin and squeeze firmly several times to empty the contents directly onto the skin.
Application on the base of the skull will minimise the ability of the cat to lick the product off.
Apply only to the skin surface and on intact skin.
10.
SPECIAL STORAGE PRECAUTIONS
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Store in the original package in order to protect from moisture.
Do not use after the expiry date stated on the label and carton.
11.
SPECIAL WARNINGS
Do not administer orally or parenterally.
Avoid the treated cat or other cats in the household licking the site of application while it is wet.
There is limited experience on the use of the product in sick and debilitated animals, thus the product should only be used based on a benefit-risk assessment for these animals.
Shampooing or immersion of the animal in water directly after treatment may reduce the efficacy of the product.
Treated animals therefore should not be bathed until the solution has dried.
To the user:
Do not smoke, eat or drink during application.
Avoid direct contact with application area while it is wet.
Keep children away from treated animals during that time.
Wash hands after use.
In case of accidental spillage onto skin, wash off immediately with soap and water.
62 If the product accidentally gets into eyes, they should be thoroughly flushed with plenty of water.
If skin or eye symptoms persist, or in case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Care should be taken not to allow children to have prolonged intensive contact (for example, by sleeping) with treated cats during the first 24 hours after application of the product.
Although the product was well tolerated by pregnant cats, studies performed in rats and rabbits suggest that emodepside may interfere with embryo-foetal development.
Therefore, women of child- bearing potential should avoid contact with, or wear disposable gloves when administering, the product.
Frequent users of the product (for example, veterinarians, professional cat breeders) should wear disposable gloves when administering the product.
The solvent in this product may stain certain materials including leather, fabrics, plastics and finished surfaces.
Allow the application site to dry before permitting contact with such materials.
12.
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED PRODUCT OR WASTE MATERIALS
Profender should not be allowed to enter surface water as emodepside has shown harmful effects on aquatic organisms.
Any unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

OTHER INFORMATION
Profender can be used during pregnancy and lactation.
Parasite resistance to any particular class of anthelmintic may develop following frequent, repeated use of an anthelmintic of that class.
Echinococcosis represents a hazard for humans.
As Echinococcosis is a notifiable disease to the OIE, specific guidelines on the treatment and follow-up, and on the safeguard of persons, need to be obtained from the relevant competent authority.

SPECIAL WARNINGS
Administer only to fasted dogs.
For example overnight fasting is recommended if the dog is to be treated in the morning.
Food may be given 4 hours or more after treatment.
The safety of this veterinary medicinal product has not been investigated in pregnant and lactating dogs.
Use in these dogs is therefore not recommended.
No studies have been performed with severely debilitated dogs or individuals with seriously compromised kidney or liver function.
Therefore, the veterinary medicinal product should only be used in such animals according to a benefit/risk assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
Temporary trembling, incoordination and depression were occasionally observed when the veterinary product was administered at overdoses of up to 5 times the recommended dose.
In mdr1 mutant (-/-) Collies the margin of safety appears lower compared to the normal dog population, with mild transient tremor and/or ataxia occasionally observed after twice the recommended dose.
The symptoms were completely self-resolving without any treatment.
Feeding can increase the frequency and intensity of such overdose symptoms and occasionally vomiting may occur.
Specific antidotes are not known.
Parasite resistance to any particular class of anthelmintic may develop following frequent, repeated use of an anthelmintic of that class.
When D. caninum infection is present, concomitant treatment against intermediate hosts such as fleas and lice should be considered to prevent reinfection.
Emodepside is a substrate for P-glycoprotein.
Co-treatment with other drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates/inhibitors (for example, ivermectin and other antiparasitic macrocyclic lactones, erythromycin, prednisolone and cyclosporine) could give rise to pharmacokinetic drug interactions.
The potential clinical consequences of such interactions have not been investigated.
To the user:
In the interests of good hygiene, wash your hands after administering the tablets to the dog.
In case of accidental ingestion, especially in the case of children, seek medical advice and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Echinococcosis represents a hazard for humans.
As Echinococcosis is a notifiable disease to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), specific guidelines on the treatment and follow-up, and on the safeguard of persons, need to be obtained from the relevant competent authority.
