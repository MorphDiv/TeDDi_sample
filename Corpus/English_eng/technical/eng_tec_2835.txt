(PHP 4 = 4.0.6)
Returns:
The database password associated with the link identifier.
fbsql_database_password() sets and retrieves the database password used by the connection. if a database is protected by a database password, the user must call this function before calling fbsql_select_db(). if the second optional parameter is given the function sets the database password for the specified link identifier.
If no link identifier is specified, the last opened link is assumed.
If no link is open, the function will try to establish a link as if fbsql_connect() was called, and use it.
This function does not change the database password in the database nor can it be used to retrive the database password for a database.
Example 1. fbsql_create_clob() example
?php $link = fbsql_pconnect ("localhost", "_SYSTEM", "secret") or die ("Could not connect"); fbsql_database_password($link, "secret db password"); fbsql_select_db($database, $link);?
