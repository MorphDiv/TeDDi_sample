& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the K Desktop Environment. & quantaplus; is designed for quick web development and is rapidly becoming a mature editor with a number of great features.
Our objective remains to create the very best web development tool anywhere. We realize that we will need many more people active to accomplish this, so we are in the process of developing enhancements geared toward making it easy for web developers to customize, extend, and enhance & quantaplus;. Then we will be asking you, the web developers, to contribute your feature enhancements. We will organize these so that & quantaplus; web developers can find just the resources, extensions and custom plug-ins they need to be the most kick butt developers ever.
& quantaplus;: Where It Was And Where It Is Going

While striving to become the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus; began to think about a rather intriguing idea: What if & quantaplus; was a generic, extensible, markup language editor? Well, that would only make it the greatest Web Development Environment for & kde;! So it was done.
No longer bound to & HTML;, & quantaplus; is now well on its way to becoming an all-purpose Web Development Environment. Essentially, if you can define it in & XML;, then & quantaplus; should be able to serve as an & IDE; for it.
Now, with the above said, it must be noted that & quantaplus; is an outgrowth of the outstanding efforts that have been put forth by the entire & kde; development community. & quantaplus;, in celebration of open source, uses the idea of Why write something somebody already wrote? Thanks to & kde; 's framework, not only is this possible, but it also allows users and developers to extend & quantaplus; to match their unique needs.
& quantaplus; provides web developers with an intuitive and powerful multiple document interface (MDI;). It can dramatically increase your productivity. Through the use of custom actions, scripting, and toolbars, you can automate almost any task. With the use of Kommander, you can extend & quantaplus; in a manner in which you never have to remember scripting command syntax again. (More about this can be found in.)
