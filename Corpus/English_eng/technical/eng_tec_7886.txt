EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
CELVAPAN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Celvapan?
Celvapan is a vaccine that is given by injection.
It contains influenza (flu) viruses that have been inactivated (killed).
Celvapan contains a flu strain called A/ VietNam/ 1203/ 2004 (H5N1).
What is Celvapan used for?
Celvapan is a vaccine to prevent ‘ pandemic’ flu.
It should only be used once a flu pandemic has been officially declared by the World Health Organization or European Union (EU).
A flu pandemic happens when a new type (strain) of flu virus appears that can spread easily from person to person because people have no immunity (protection) against it.
A pandemic can affect most countries and regions around the world.
Celvapan would be given according to official recommendations.
Celvapan has been studied in adults, including the elderly (above 60 years of age).
The vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Celvapan used?
Celvapan is given by injection into the shoulder muscle in two doses, at least three weeks apart.
How does Celvapan work?
Celvapan is a ‘ mock-up’ vaccine.
This is a special type of vaccine that is designed to help with the management of a pandemic.
Before a pandemic starts, nobody knows which strain of flu virus will be involved, so pharmaceutical companies cannot prepare the correct vaccine in advance.
Instead, they can prepare a vaccine that contains a strain of flu virus specifically chosen because nobody has been exposed to it, and to which nobody is immune.
They can then test this vaccine to see how people react to it, allowing them to predict how people will react when the flu strain causing the pandemic is included.
Vaccines work by ‘ teaching’ the immune system (the body’ s natural defences) how to defend itself against a disease.
Celvapan contains a virus called H5N1 that has been inactivated (killed) so that it does not cause any disease.
If a pandemic starts, the virus strain in Celvapan will be replaced by the strain causing the pandemic before the vaccine can be used.
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the inactivated virus as ‘ foreign’ and makes antibodies against it.
The immune system will then be able to produce antibodies more quickly when it is exposed to the virus again.
This helps to protect against the disease.

The viruses used in Celvapan are grown in mammal cells (‘ vero cells’), unlike those in some other flu vaccines, which are grown in hen ’ s eggs.
How has Celvapan been studied?
The effects of Celvapan were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The main study of Celvapan included 561 healthy volunteers, 281 of whom were over the age of 60 years.
The study looked at the ability of two 7.5-microgram doses of Celvapan, given 21 days apart, to trigger the production of antibodies (‘ immunogenicity’). The main measures of effectiveness were the levels of antibodies against the flu virus in the blood before vaccination, on the day of the second injection (day 21), and 21 days after the second vaccination (day 42).
What benefit has Celvapan shown during the studies?
According to criteria laid down by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), a mock-up vaccine needs to bring about protective levels of antibodies in at least 70% of people for it to be considered suitable.
The study showed that Celvapan produced an antibody response that met these criteria.
At 21 days after the second injection, 72% of the adults below 60 years of age (192 out of 265) and 74% of those above 60 years of age (200 out of 270) had levels of antibodies that would protect them against H5N1.
What is the risk associated with Celvapan?
The most common side effect with Celvapan (seen in more than 1 people vaccinated in 10) is pain at the site of the injection.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Celvapan, see the Package Leaflet.
Celvapan should not be given to people who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to any of the components of the vaccine, or to any of the substances found at trace (very low) levels in the vaccine, such as formaldehyde, benzonase or sucrose.
If a pandemic has started, however, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine to these patients, as long as facilities for resuscitation are available.
Why has Celvapan been approved?
The CHMP decided that Celvapan’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.
The Committee recommended that Celvapan be given marketing authorisation.
Celvapan has been authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’.
This means that because the strain of flu virus that may cause a pandemic is not known, it has not been possible to obtain full information about the future pandemic vaccine.
Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary.
What information is still awaited for Celvapan?
If a pandemic is declared, the company that makes Celvapan will include the flu strain responsible in the vaccine.
It will then collect information on the safety and effectiveness of the final pandemic vaccine, and submit this to the CHMP for evaluation.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Celvapan?
If Celvapan is used during a pandemic, the company that makes it will collect information on the safety of the vaccine while it is being used.
This will include information on its side effects and its safety in the elderly, pregnant women, patients with severe conditions, and people who have problems with their immune systems.
Other information about Celvapan:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Celvapan to Baxter AG on 04 March 2009.
