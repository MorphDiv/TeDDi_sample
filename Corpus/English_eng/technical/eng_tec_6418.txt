Next: An Introduction to Konqueror
Search the Web
Konqueror makes working with and managing your files easy. You can browse both local and networked folders while enjoying advanced features such as the powerful sidebar and file previews.
Konqueror is also a full featured and easy to use web browser which you can use to explore the Internet. Enter the address (e. g. http: / /www. kde. org) of a web page you would like to visit in the location bar and press Enter, or choose an entry from the Bookmarks menu.
To return to the previous location, press the back button in the toolbar.
To quickly go to your Home folder press the home button.
For more detailed documentation on Konqueror click here.
Tuning Tip: If you want the Konqueror web browser to start faster, you can turn off this information screen by clicking here. You can re-enable it by choosing the Help - > Konqueror Introduction menu option, and then pressing Settings - > Save View Profile As... - > "Web Browsing".
Next: Tips & Tricks
Konqueror is designed to embrace and support Internet standards. The aim is to fully implement the officially sanctioned standards from organizations such as the W3 and OASIS, while also adding extra support for other common usability features that arise as de facto standards across the Internet. Along with this support, for such functions as favicons, Web Shortcuts, and XBEL bookmarks, Konqueror also implements:

Tips & Tricks
Use Web-Shortcuts: by typing "gg: KDE" one can search the Internet, using Google, for the search phrase "KDE". There are a lot of Web-Shortcuts predefined to make searching for software or looking up certain words in an encyclopedia a breeze. You can even create your own Web-Shortcuts.
Use the magnifier button in the toolbar to increase the font size on your web page.
When you want to paste a new address into the Location toolbar you might want to clear the current entry by pressing the black arrow with the white cross in the toolbar.
To create a link on your desktop pointing to the current page, simply drag the "Location" label that is to the left of the Location toolbar, drop it on to the desktop, and choose "Link".
You can also find "Full-Screen Mode" in the Settings menu. This feature is very useful for "Talk" sessions.
Divide et impera (lat. "Divide and conquer") - by splitting a window into two parts (e. g. Window - > Split View Left/ Right) you can make Konqueror appear the way you like. You can even load some example view-profiles (e. g. Midnight Commander), or create your own ones.
Use the user-agent feature if the website you are visiting asks you to use a different browser (and do not forget to send a complaint to the webmaster!)
The History in your SideBar ensures that you can keep track of the pages you have visited recently.
Use a caching proxy to speed up your Internet connection.
Advanced users will appreciate the Konsole which you can embed into Konqueror (Settings - > Show Terminal Emulator).

Detailed tooltips
Clear History
This is the URL of the web page where Konqueror (as web browser) will jump to when the \\"Home\\ "button is pressed. When Konqueror is started as a file manager, that button makes it jump to your local home folder instead.
Maximum number of Closed Items
This sets the maximum number of closed items that will be stored in memory. This limit will not be surpassed.
Open folders in separate windows
If this option is checked, Konqueror will open a new window when you open a folder, rather than showing that folder's contents in the current window.
Show file tips
Here you can control if, when moving the mouse over a file, you want to see a small popup window with additional information about that file
Show previews in file tips
Here you can control if you want the popup window to contain a larger preview for the file, when moving the mouse over it
Show'Delete 'menu entries which bypass the trashcan
Uncheck this if you do not want'Delete 'menu commands to be displayed on the desktop and in the file manager's menus and context menus. You can still delete files when hidden by holding the Shift key while calling'Move to Trash'.
Number of Open With items in the File menu
Standard font
This is the font used to display text in Konqueror windows.
Maximum number of history items per view
Ask confirmation for deleting a file.
This option tells Konqueror whether to ask for a confirmation when you delete a file without using the trash folder. Warning, deleted files can not be recovered, so it is recommended to leave this confirmation enabled.
Ask confirmation for move to trash
This option tells Konqueror whether to ask for a confirmation when you move the file to your trash folder, from where it can be recovered very easily.
If true, when opening a session from within the sessions dialog the tabs will be opened inside current window.
