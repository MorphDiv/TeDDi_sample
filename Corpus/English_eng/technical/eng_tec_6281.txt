Institutions
The Institutions screen provides a summary of all the accounts grouped under their respective institutions. Asset accounts are symbolized with a black arrow, and liability accounts are symbolized with a red arrow.
The Institutions screen displays several columns, including the type of account and the value of each account. It also shows the total value of all accounts in each institution.
