Tab inserts spaces
On: Pressing tab generates the appropriate number of spaces. Off: A tab character will be inserted.
Tab size:
Auto indentation
On: The indentation of the previous line is used for a new line.
Auto copy selection
On: Any selection is immediately written to the clipboard. Off: You must explicitely copy e. g. via Ctrl-C.
Line end style:
Sets the line endings for when an edited file is saved. DOS/ Windows: CR+LF; UNIX: LF; with CR=0D, LF=0A
Diff
Diff Settings
Treat as white space.
Ignore numbers
Ignore number characters during line matching phase. (Similar to Ignore white space.) Might help to compare files with numeric data.
Ignore C/ C++ comments
Treat C/ C++ comments like white space.
Ignore case
Treat case differences like white space changes. ('a '< = > 'A')
Preprocessor command:
User defined pre-processing. (See the docs for details.)
Line-matching preprocessor command:
This pre-processor is only used during line matching. (See the docs for details.)
Try hard (slower)
Enables the --minimal option for the external diff. The analysis of big files will be much slower.
Align B and C for 3 input files
Try to align B and C when comparing or merging three input files. Not recommended for merging because merge might get more complicated. (Default is off.)
Merge Settings
Auto advance delay (ms):
When in Auto-Advance mode the result of the current selection is shown for the specified time, before jumping to the next conflict. Range: 0-2000 ms
Show info dialogs
Show a dialog with information about the number of conflicts.
White space 2-file merge default:
Manual Choice
Allow the merge algorithm to automatically select an input for white-space-only changes.
White space 3-file merge default:
Automatic Merge Regular Expression
Regular expression for lines where KDiff3 should automatically choose one source. When a line with a conflict matches the regular expression then - if available - C, otherwise B will be chosen.
Run regular expression auto merge on merge start
Run the merge for auto merge regular expressions immediately when a merge starts.
Version Control History Merging
Regular expression for the start of the version control history entry. Usually this line contains the "$Log$" keyword. Default value: ". *\\$Log. *\\$. *"
A version control history entry consists of several lines. Specify the regular expression to detect the first line (without the leading comment). Use parentheses to group the keys you want to use for sorting. If left empty, then KDiff3 assumes that empty lines separate history entries. See the documentation for details.
History merge sorting
Sort version control history by a key.
History entry start sort key order:
Each pair of parentheses used in the regular expression for the history start entry groups a key that can be used for sorting. Specify the list of keys (that are numbered in order of occurrence starting with 1) using ',' as separator (e. g. "4,5,6,1,2,3,7"). If left empty, then no sorting will be done. See the documentation for details.
Merge version control history on merge start
Run version control history automerge on merge start.
Max number of history entries:
Cut off after specified number. Use -1 for infinite number of entries.
Test your regular expressions
Irrelevant merge command:
If specified this script is run after automerge when no other relevant changes were detected. Called with the parameters: filename1 filename2 filename3
Auto save and quit on merge without conflicts
If KDiff3 was started for a file-merge from the command line and all conflicts are solvable without user interaction then automatically save and quit. (Similar to command line option "--auto".)
Directory
Recursive directories
Whether to analyze subdirectories or not.
File pattern(s):
Pattern(s) of files to be analyzed. Wildcards: '* 'and'? 'Several Patterns can be specified by using the separator:'; '
File-anti-pattern(s):
Pattern(s) of files to be excluded from analysis. Wildcards: '* 'and'? 'Several Patterns can be specified by using the separator:'; '
Dir-anti-pattern(s):
Pattern(s) of directories to be excluded from analysis. Wildcards: '* 'and'? 'Several Patterns can be specified by using the separator:'; '
Use. cvsignore
Extends the antipattern to anything that would be ignored by CVS. Via local ". cvsignore" files this can be directory specific.
Find hidden files and directories
Finds files and directories with the hidden attribute.
Finds files and directories starting with '.'.
Follow file links
On: Compare the file the link points to. Off: Compare the links.
Follow directory links
On: Compare the directory the link points to. Off: Compare the links.
Case sensitive filename comparison
The directory comparison will compare files or directories when their names match. Set this option if the case of the names must match. (Default for Windows is off, otherwise on.)
File Comparison Mode
Binary comparison
Binary comparison of each file. (Default)
Full analysis
Do a full analysis and show statistics information in extra columns. (Slower than a binary comparison, much slower for binary files.)
Trust the size and modification date (unsafe)
Assume that files are equal if the modification date and file length are equal. Files with equal contents but different modification dates will appear as different. Useful for big directories or slow networks.
Trust the size and date, but use binary comparison if date does not match (unsafe)
Assume that files are equal if the modification date and file length are equal. If the dates are not equal but the sizes are, use binary comparison. Useful for big directories or slow networks.
Trust the size (unsafe)
Assume that files are equal if their file lengths are equal. Useful for big directories or slow networks when the date is modified during download.
Synchronize directories
Offers to store files in both directories so that both directories are the same afterwards. Works only when comparing two directories without specifying a destination.
White space differences considered equal
If files differ only by white space consider them equal. This is only active when full analysis is chosen.
Copy newer instead of merging (unsafe)
Do n't look inside, just take the newer file. (Use this only if you know what you are doing!) Only effective when comparing two directories.
Backup files (. orig)
If a file would be saved over an old file, then the old file will be renamed with a '. orig' extension instead of being deleted.
Regional Settings
Language (restart required)
Choose the language of the GUI strings or "Auto". For a change of language to take place, quit and restart KDiff3.
Use the same encoding for everything:
Enable this allows to change all encodings by changing the first only. Disable this if different individual settings are needed.
Note: Local Encoding is
File Encoding for A:
If enabled then Unicode (UTF-16 or UTF-8) encoding will be detected. If the file is not Unicode then the selected encoding will be used as fallback. (Unicode detection depends on the first bytes of a file.)
Auto Detect Unicode
File Encoding for B:
File Encoding for C:
File Encoding for Merge Output and Saving:
Auto Select
If enabled then the encoding from the input files is used. In ambiguous cases a dialog will ask the user to choose the encoding for saving.
File Encoding for Preprocessor Files:
Right To Left Language
Some languages are read from right to left. This setting will change the viewer and editor accordingly.
Integration
Integration Settings
Command line options to ignore:
List of command line options that should be ignored when KDiff3 is used by other tools. Several values can be specified if separated via ';' This will suppress the "Unknown option" error.
Quit also via Escape key
Fast method to exit. For those who are used to using the Escape key.
Integrate with ClearCase
Integrate with Rational ClearCase from IBM. Modifies the "map" file in ClearCase subdir "lib/ mgrs" (Only enabled when ClearCase "bin" directory is in the path.)
Remove ClearCase Integration
Restore the old "map" file from before doing the ClearCase integration.
