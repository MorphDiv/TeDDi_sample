Introduction
Gametype:
Arcade, Board
Number of possible players:
One
& kappname; is a solitaire-like game played using the standard set of Mahjong tiles. Unlike Mahjong however, & kappname; has only one layer of scrambled tiles. You can remove matching pieces if they can be connected with a line with at most two bends in it. At the same time, the line must not cross any other tiles. To win a game of & kappname; the player has to remove all the tiles from the game board.
How to Play
Objective:
Remove all the tiles from the game board within the shortest time possible.
& kappname; will load a default layout automatically once you start the game and you can start playing right away.
You should carefully study the tiles lied out on the game board and find two tiles matching exactly. When you have found such a pair use your mouse to select them.
Once you select a matching pair of tiles they will vanish from the game board. However, even if the tiles you select appear as open they will only be removed from the board if they can be connected with a line having at most two bends and not crossing any other tiles. Furthermore the line can only be drawn horizontally and vertically.
Find as many matches as possible to remove all the tiles from the game board.

Matching tiles are such tiles where the face pictograms match exactly.
Note:
There are exceptions to this rule. In the traditional game of Mahjong each tile has a matching one except for the Flowers and Seasons tiles.
The Flowers tiles have no doubles in the set and can be matched directly to each other.
The Seasons tiles have no doubles in the set and can be matched directly to each other.
Tiles can only be removed if they can be connected with a maximum of three connected lines that do not cross any other tile. Lines can be horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal.
You do not have to draw the lines by yourself, the game does this for you. Just mark two matching tiles on the board, if they can be connected by a line with at most two bends, the line is drawn and the tiles are removed.
Lines may only cross empty areas of the board.
Some games are unsolvable. If you would like to avoid unsolvable games uncheck the option Allow unsolvable games in the configuration dialog.
The scores are awarded for the time the player needs to remove all the tiles from the game board. Games with more tiles give more scores.
If you played with the Gravity setting enabled, the score will be doubled.
To be eligible for a place amongst the high scores player has to complete a game instance within the shortest period of time possible.
If the player uses the Undo or Hint feature the record will not be considered as a high score.

Gravity
Checking this makes the game even harder: If a tile is removed, all tiles lying above it will fall down one step.
Allow unsolvable games
If checked, you run the risk of being presented with games that are impossible to solve. Note: Even when not checked, you will fail to complete a game if you remove the tiles in the wrong order.
Use Chinese style: any flower match any flower, any season match any season
Use the traditional rules for matching the tiles. Previous version of & kappname; used to allow only exact tiles matches, which is inconsistent with Mahjong rules. It is recommended to keep this option checked.
Tiles can slide, but you can connect only in 2 lines instead of 3
This option changes the rules to the point where it almost becomes a completely different game. When it is active, you can only remove the tiles if they can be connected by a line consisting of only two segments instead of the customary three. However, you are allowed to slide the tiles on the board, if the row or column where they are placed has some empty space. To make a sliding move, you have to click on the tile containing the column or row that can slide, and then on the matching tile. If there are two possible sliding moves, you will have to click on one of the two connecting lines to chose your preferred move.
Board Difficulty
The slider controls the difficulty of the board (i. e. how much the tiles are shuffled) from Easy to Hard.
Piece Removal Speed
Adjusting this slider alters the speed at which the pieces are removed from the screen after a match has been made.
Board Size
This slider allows you to can change the number of tiles on the board. The more tiles you have, the harder (and longer) the game will be.
Help

Saves your changes and closes the dialog.
Apply
Saves your changes but does not close the dialog.
Cancel
Discards all your changes and closes the dialog.

& kshisen; Handbook
The Help Menu
The & kshisen; Handbook
& kshisen; is a game similar to Mahjongg for & kde;.
shisen-sho
& kshisen; is a single player patience game, that uses the Mahjongg tiles.
Playing & kshisen;
Remember that lines only may cross the empty border. If you are stuck, you can use the Hint feature to find two tiles which may be removed. Clicking a tile with the & RMB; will show you all corresponding tiles, no matter if they are removable at the moment or not.
The resulting score S is calculated using the following formula, assuming that n represents the number of tiles present when the game started and t standing for the time (in seconds) it took to clear the field:
S=(n/ t)*sqrt(n/ 84)/ 0.0014

Requirements
In order to successfully compile & kshisen;, you need & kde; 4. x. All required libraries as well as & kshisen; itself can be found on & kde-ftp;.
Prefer Unscaled Tiles
Resizing the window causes the tiles on the board to be scaled to match the window size. When this option is checked, the window is resized to fit the tiles' natural size. You can still adjust the size of the window. Doing so causes this mode to be disengaged.
Defaults
Reverts all settings to defaults.
If checked, only solvable games will be created when a new game is started. Note: You may still choose the wrong way and have to try again if you did n't solve the game, but if it's checked, the game will be solvable.
This Handbook describes & kshisen; Version 1.5.1

raabe@kde. org
The game is over if no moves are possible and some tiles are left on the board (this should not happen if the option Disallow Unsolvable Games in the Settings menu is checked, since for these games there is at least one way to solve it, though it may happen that you choose the wrong way).
& kshisen; has several possibilities to change its behavior. All options can be changed from the menu Settings.
The options will be saved automatically.
