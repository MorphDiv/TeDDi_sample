The SUM() function can also be used in this way, for example, as COUNTIF() with several criteria.
SUMIF function
adding;specified numbers
mw added one entry
SUMIF
Adds the cells specified by a given criteria.
This function is used to browse a range when you search for a certain value.
Syntax:
SUMIF(Range; Criteria; SumRange)
Range
is the range to which the criteria are to be applied.
Criteria
is a reference to a cell containing the search criteria, or the search criteria themselves.
If the criteria are written into the formula, they must be enclosed with double quotes.
SumRange
is the range from which values are summed.
If this parameter has not been indicated, the values found in the Range are summed.
SUMIF supports the reference concatenation operator (~) only in the Criteria parameter and only if the optional SumRange parameter is not given.
Example:
=SUMIF(A1:A10; &quot; < 0 &quot; )
=SUMIF(A1:A10; &quot; > 0 &quot; ; B1:10)
- sums values from the range B1:B10 only if the corresponding values in the range A1:A10 are > 0.
See COUNTIF() for some more syntax examples that can be used with SUMIF().
TAN function
TAN
Returns the tangent of the given angle (in radians).
Syntax:
TAN(Number)
Number
, the angle in radians.
To return the tangent of an angle in degrees, use the RADIANS function.
Example:
=TAN(PI()/4)
returns 1, the tangent of PI/4 radians.
=TAN(RADIANS(45))
returns 1, the tangent of 45 degrees.
see also COS, SIN, COT, ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, ACOT
TANH function
TANH
Returns the hyperbolic tangent of a number.
Syntax:
TANH(Number)
Number
.
Example:
=TANH(0)
returns 0, the hyperbolic tangent of 0.
see also COSH, SINH, COTH, ACOSH, ASINH, ATANH, ACOTH
AutoFilter function; subtotals
sums;of filtered data
filtered data; sums
SUBTOTAL function
mw made &quot; sums... &quot; a two level entry
SUBTOTAL
Calculates subtotals.
If a range already contains subtotals, these are not used for further calculations.
Use this function with the AutoFilters to take only the filtered records into account.
Syntax:
SUBTOTAL(Function; Range)
Function
is a number that stands for one of the following functions:
Function index
Function
1
AVERAGE
2
COUNT
3
COUNTA
4
MAX
5
MIN
6
PRODUCT
7
STDEV
8
STDEVP
9
SUM
10
VAR
11
VARP
Range
is the range of cells included.
Example:
You have a table in the cell range A1:B5 containing cities in column A and accompanying figures in column B.
You have used an AutoFilter so that you only see rows containing the city Hamburg.
You want to see the sum of the figures that are displayed; that is, just the subtotal for the filtered rows.
In this case the correct formula would be:
=SUBTOTAL(9; B2:B5)
euro; converting
EUROCONVERT function
EUROCONVERT
Converts between old European national currency and to and from euros.
Syntax:
EUROCONVERT(Value; &quot; From_currency &quot; ; &quot; To_currency &quot; ; Full_precision; Triangulation_precision)
Value
is the amount in the currency to be converted.
From_currency
and
To_currency
are the currency units to convert from and to respectively.
These must be text, the official abbreviation for the currency (for example, &quot; EUR &quot; ).
The rates (shown per euro) were set by the European Commission.
Full_precision
is optional.
If omitted or False, the result is rounded according to the decimals of the To currency.
If Full_precision is True, the result is not rounded.
Triangulation_precision
is optional.
If Triangulation_precision is given and > =3, the intermediate result of a triangular conversion (currency1, EUR, currency2) is rounded to that precision.
If Triangulation_precision is omitted, the intermediate result is not rounded.
Also if To currency is &quot; EUR &quot; , Triangulation_precision is used as if triangulation was needed and conversion from EUR to EUR was applied.
Examples:
=EUROCONVERT(100; &quot; ATS &quot; ; &quot; EUR &quot; )
converts 100 Austrian Schillings into euros.
=EUROCONVERT(100; &quot; EUR &quot; ; &quot; DEM &quot; )
converts 100 euros into German Marks.
CONVERT function
CONVERT
Converts a value from one unit of measurement to another unit of measurement.
The conversion factors are given in a list in the configuration.
At one time the list of conversion factors included the legacy European currencies and the Euro (see examples below).
We suggest using the new function EUROCONVERT for converting these currencies.
Syntax:
CONVERT(value; &quot; text &quot; ; &quot; text &quot; )
Example:
=CONVERT(100; &quot; ATS &quot; ; &quot; EUR &quot; )
returns the Euro value of 100 Austrian Schillings.
=CONVERT(100; &quot; EUR &quot; ; &quot; DEM &quot; ) converts 100 euros into German Marks.
ODD function
rounding;up/down to nearest odd integer
mw added one entry
ODD
Rounds a positive number up to the nearest odd integer and a negative number down to the nearest odd integer.
Syntax:
ODD(Number)
Number
rounded to the next odd integer up, away from zero.
Example:
=ODD(1.2)
returns 3.
=ODD(1)
returns 1.
=ODD(0)
returns 1.
=ODD(-3.1)
returns -5.

FLOOR function
rounding;down to nearest multiple of significance
mw added one entry
FLOOR
Rounds a number down to the nearest multiple of Significance.
Syntax:
FLOOR(Number; Significance; Mode)
Number
is the number that is to be rounded down.
Significance
is the value that the number is to be rounded down to a multiple of.
Mode
is an optional value.
If it is indicated and is not equal to zero, if the number and increment are negative, rounding up is carried out based on that value.
It is also possible that this value is ignored after completing an import to Microsoft Excel as Excel does not support a third parameter for this function.
Number
and
Significance
are negative, and if the
Mode
value is equal to zero or is not specified, then the results in $[officename] Calc and Excel will differ after exporting.
If you export the spreadsheet to Excel, use Mode = 1 to see the same results in Excel as in Calc.
Example:
=FLOOR( -11; -2)
returns -12
=FLOOR( -11; -2; 0)
returns -12
=FLOOR( -11; -2; 1)
returns -10

SIGN function
algebraic signs
mw added one entry
SIGN
Returns the sign of a number.
Returns +1 if the number is positive, -1 if negative and 0 if zero.
Syntax:
SIGN(Number)
Number
is the number of which the sign is to be determined.
Example:
=SIGN(3.4)
returns 1.
=SIGN(-4.5)
returns -1.

MROUND function
nearest multiple
mw added one entry
MROUND
Returns a number rounded to the nearest multiple of another number.
Syntax:
MROUND(Number; Multiple)
Number
rounded to the nearest multiple of
Multiple
.
Multiple * ROUND(Number/Multiple)
.
Example:
=MROUND(15.5; 3)
returns 15, as 15.5 is closer to 15 (= 3*5) than to 18 (= 3*6).
=MROUND(1.4; 0.5)
returns 1.5 (= 0.5*3).

COUNTIF function
counting;specified cells
mw added one entry
COUNTIF
Returns the number of cells that meet with certain criteria within a cell range.
Syntax:
COUNTIF(Range; Criteria)
Range
is the range to which the criteria are to be applied.
Criteria
indicates the criteria in the form of a number, an expression or a character string.
These criteria determine which cells are counted.
You may also enter search text in the form of a regular expression, e.g. &quot; b.* &quot; for all words that begin with b.
You may also indicate a cell range that contains the search criterion.
If you search for literal text, enclose the text in double quotes.
Example:
2000
to
2009
.
Cell B1 contains the number
2006
.
In cell B2, you enter a formula:
=COUNTIF(A1:A10; 2006)
- this returns 1
=COUNTIF(A1:A10; B1)
- this returns 1
=COUNTIF(A1:A10; &quot; > =2006 &quot; )
- this returns 3
=COUNTIF(A1:A10; &quot; < &quot; & B1)
- when B1 contains
2006
, this returns 6
=COUNTIF(A1:A10; C2)
where cell C2 contains the text
> 2006
counts the number of cells in the range A1:A10 which are > 2006
=COUNTIF(A1:A10; &quot; < 0 &quot; )
