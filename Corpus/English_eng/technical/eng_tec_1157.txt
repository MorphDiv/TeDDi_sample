Saving Text Documents in HTML Format
You can save a $[officename] Writer document in HTML format, so that you can view it in a web browser.
If you want, you can associate a page break with a specific heading paragraph style to generate a separate HTML page each time the style appears in the document. $[officename] Writer automatically creates a page containing hyperlinks to each of these pages.
When you save a text document in HTML format, any graphics in the document are saved in JPEG format.
The name of the HTML document is added as a prefix to the name of the graphic file.
The JPEG images are saved in the same folder as the HTML document and are referenced with < IMG > tags in the HTML code.
Apply one of the default $[officename] heading paragraph styles, for example, &quot; Heading 1 &quot; , to the paragraphs where you want to generate a new HTML page.
