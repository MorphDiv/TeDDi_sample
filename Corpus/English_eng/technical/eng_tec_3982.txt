mysql_thread_id() returns the current thread ID.
If the connection is lost and you reconnect with mysql_ping(), the thread ID will change.
This means you should not get the thread ID and store it for later.
You should get it when you need it.
Example 1. mysql_thread_id() example
?php $link = mysql_connect( 'localhost', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password'); $thread_id = mysql_thread_id($link); if ($thread_id) {printf ("current thread id is %d\n", $thread_id);}?
The above example would produce the following output:
current thread id is 73
