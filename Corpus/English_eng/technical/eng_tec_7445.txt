EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
PREVICOX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Previcox?
Previcox contains the active substance firocoxib, which belongs to a class of medicines having anti- inflammatory action.
Previcox is presented as chewable tablets for dogs (57 mg and 227 mg) and is also authorised as an oral paste for horses (8.2 mg/ g).
What is Previcox used for?
Previcox is used for a relief of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in dogs and for the alleviation of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and reduction of associated lameness in horses.
The dose, duration of treatment and frequency will depend on the weight and type of animal and condition to be treated.
For details, please see the Package Leaflet.
How does Previcox work?
Previcox contains firocoxib, which belongs to a class of medicines called non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) belonging to the Coxib group, which acts by selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).
Coxibs display pain relief, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties.
Firocoxib blocks the enzyme (cyclo-oxygenase) that is involved in the production of prostaglandins.
As the prostaglandins are substances that trigger pain, exudation and inflammation, Previcox, therefore, reduces those responses.
How has Previcox been studied?
Previcox has been studied in laboratory animals, as well as in dogs and horses that were treated in various veterinary practices/ clinics across Europe (“ clinical studies”).
Dog:
Previcox chewable tablets for dogs were studied in two large European field studies in dogs for a period of up to 90 days.
The results showed an improvement in lameness score in dogs with established osteoarthritis.
The product was shown to be comparable to other reference products (carprofen and meloxicam, respectively).

Two multi-centre studies were conducted (one in the US and one in Europe) to investigate the efficacy, safety and acceptability of firocoxib under field conditions when administered to horses orally once daily for 14 days at a dose of 0.1 mg/ kg.
The CVMP concluded that Previcox oral paste was as effective as other authorised products (phenylbutazone and vedaprofen) in the alleviation of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and the reduction of associated lameness in horses.
What benefit has Previcox shown during the studies?
Previcox tablets for dogs improved the scores for the relief of pain and inflammation.
Administration of the product in accordance with the recommended dosing schedule for a period of up to 90 days resulted in an improvement in lameness score in dogs with established osteoarthritis.
Previcox oral paste administered once daily for 14 days at a dose of 0.1 mg/ kg improved clinical scores for lameness and soft tissue injuries in horses and also helped alleviate pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in horses.
What are the side-effects of Previcox?
The side effects of Previcox are typical for those seen with other medicines in this product class (NSAIDs) such as oral lesions (tissue damage) in the mouth of horses, soft faeces/ diarrhoea or lethargy.
These reactions are generally of a transitory nature and are reversible when the treatment is stopped.
Previcox must not be administered with corticosteroids or other NSAIDs.
Care should also be taken when used with molecules displaying action on renal flow e. g. diuretics.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
Wash hands after use of the product.
Return halved tablets to the blister and keep out of the reach of children.
Women of child-bearing age should avoid contact with, or wear disposable gloves, when administering the product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
What is the time to allow before a horse can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption (withdrawal period)?
After the last day of treatment with Previcox, horses should not be slaughtered for 26 days (when treated with the oral paste).
The use of Previcox is not permitted in mares producing milk for human consumption.
Why has Previcox been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of Previcox exceed the risks for the treatment of relief of pain and inflammation in both dogs and horses and recommended that Previcox be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
