fbsql_affected_rows() returns the number of rows affected by the last INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE query associated with link_identifier.
If the link identifier isn' t specified, the last link opened by fbsql_connect() is assumed.
Note:
If you are using transactions, you need to call fbsql_affected_rows() after your INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE query, not after the commit.
If the last query was a DELETE query with no WHERE clause, all of the records will have been deleted from the table but this function will return zero.
Note:
When using UPDATE, FrontBase will not update columns where the new value is the same as the old value.
This creates the possibility that fbsql_affected_rows() may not actually equal the number of rows matched, only the number of rows that were literally affected by the query.
If the last query failed, this function will return -1.
