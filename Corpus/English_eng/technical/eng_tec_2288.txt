Control Structures

The declare construct is used to set execution directives for a block of code.
The syntax of declare is similar to the syntax of other flow control constructs:
declare (directive) statement
The directive section allows the behavior of the declare block to be set.
Currently only one directive is recognized: the ticks directive. (See below for more information on the ticks directive)
The statement part of the declare block will be executed - - how it is executed and what side effects occur during execution may depend on the directive set in the directive block.
A tick is an event that occurs for every N low-level statements executed by the parser within the declare A tick is an event that occurs for every N low-level statements executed by the parser within the declare block.
The value for N is specified using ticks= N within the declare blocks' s directive section.
The event( s) that occur on each tick are specified using the register_tick_function().
See the example below for more details.
Note that more than one event can occur for each tick.
Example 12-1.
Profile a section of PHP code
?php / / A function that records the time when it is called function profile ($dump = FALSE) {static $profile; / / Return the times stored in profile, then erase it if ($dump) {$temp = $profile; unset ($profile); return ($temp);} $profile[] = microtime ();} / / Set up a tick handler register_tick_function("profile"); / / Initialize the function before the declare block profile (); / / Run a block of code, throw a tick every 2nd statement declare (ticks=2) {for ($x = 1; $x 50; ++$x) {echo similar_text (md5($x), md5($x*$x)), "br / ;";}} / / Display the data stored in the profiler print_r (profile (TRUE));?
Ticks are well suited for debugging, implementing simple multitasking, backgrounded I / O and many other tasks.
See also register_tick_function() and unregister_tick_function().
