When selected, the vi input mode will be enabled when opening a new view. You can still toggle the vi input mode on/ off for a particular view in the Edit menu.
Use Vi input mode
When selected, vi commands will override Kate's built-in commands. For example: Ctrl+R will redo, and override the standard action (showing the search and replace dialog).
Let Vi commands override Kate shortcuts
By default, an extra status bar will be used when the Vi input mode is enabled. This status bar shows commands while they are being typed and messages/ errors produced by Vi commands. Checking this options will hide this extra status line.

Text Cursor Movement
When selected, pressing the home key will cause the cursor to skip whitespace and go to the start of a line's text. The same applies for the end key.
Smart home and smart end
When on, moving the insertion cursor using the Left and Right keys will go on to previous/ next line at beginning/ end of the line, similar to most editors. When off, the insertion cursor cannot be moved left of the line start, but it can be moved off the line end, which can be very handy for programmers.
Wrap cursor
Selects whether the PageUp and PageDown keys should alter the vertical position of the cursor relative to the top of the view.
& PageUp/ PageDown moves cursor
& Autocenter cursor (lines):
Sets the number of lines to maintain visible above and below the cursor when possible.

Default indentation mode:
This is a list of available indentation modes. The specified indentation mode will be used for all new documents. Be aware that it is also possible to set the indentation mode with document variables, modes or a. kateconfig file.
Indentation Properties
Indentation width:
The indentation width is the number of spaces which is used to indent a line. If the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators in the section Editing is disabled, a Tab character is inserted if the indentation is divisible by the tab width.
If this option is disabled, changing the indentation level aligns a line to a multiple of the width specified in Indentation width.
Keep extra spaces
If this option is selected, pasted code from the clipboard is indented. Triggering the undo -action removes the indentation.
Adjust indentation of code pasted from the clipboard
Indentation Actions
If this option is selected, the Backspace key decreases the indentation level if the cursor is located in the leading blank space of a line.
Backspace key in leading blank space unindents
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Tab key action (if no selection exists )< a href="If you want Tab to align the current line in the current code block like in emacs, make Tab a shortcut to the action Align." > More...
If this option is selected, the Tab key always inserts white space so that the next tab postion is reached. If the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators in the section Editing is enabled, spaces are inserted; otherwise, a single tabulator is inserted.
Always advance to the next tab position
If this option is selected, the Tab key always indents the current line by the number of character positions specified in Indentation width.
Always increase indentation level
If this option is selected, the Tab key either indents the current line or advances to the next tab position. If the insertion point is at or before the first non-space character in the line, or if there is a selection, the current line is indented by the number of character positions specified in Indentation width. If the insertion point is located after the first non-space character in the line and there is no selection, white space is inserted so that the next tab postion is reached: if the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators in the section Editing is enabled, spaces are inserted; otherwise, a single tabulator is inserted.
Increase indentation level if in leading blank space
File Format
& Encoding:
Encoding autodetection:
End of line:
UNIX
DOS/ Windows
Macintosh
If this option is enabled the editor will autodetect the end of line type. The first found end of line type will be used for the whole file.
Automatic end of line detection
Enable byte order marker (if not overridden by other settings)
Automatic Cleanups on Load/ Save
The editor will automatically eliminate extra spaces at the ends of lines of text while loading/ saving the file. This change is only visible after a save if you reload the file.
Remove trailing spaces
Folder Config File
Search & depth for config file:
The editor will search the given number of folder levels upwards for a. kateconfig file and load the settings line from it.
Do not use config file
Backing up on save will cause Kate to copy the disk file to'lt; prefixgt; lt; filenamegt; lt; suffixgt; 'before saving changes. The suffix defaults to ~ and prefix is empty by default.
Backup on Save
If this option is enabled, backups for local files will be created when saving.
& Local files
If this option is enabled, backups for remote files will be created when saving.
& Remote files
& Prefix:
Enter the prefix to prepend to the backup file names.

Calculates the difference between the editor contents and the disk file using diff(1).
& View Difference
Dynamic & word wrap indicators (if applicable):
Choose when the Dynamic Word Wrap Indicators should be displayed.
Align dynamically wrapped lines to indentation depth:
Enables the start of dynamically wrapped lines to be aligned vertically to the indentation level of the first line. This can help to make code and markup more readable. Additionally, this allows you to set a maximum width of the screen, as a percentage, after which dynamically wrapped lines will no longer be vertically aligned. For example, at 50%, lines whose indentation levels are deeper than 50% of the width of the screen will not have vertical alignment applied to subsequent wrapped lines.

Borders
If this option is checked, every new view will display marks for code folding, if code folding is available.

Changing this mode affects only newly opened / created documents. In KWrite a restart is recommended.
Enable power user mode (KDE 3 mode)
If this is enabled, the editor will display vertical lines to help identify indent lines.
Show indentation lines
If this is enabled, the range between the selected matching brackets will be highlighted.
Highlight range between selected brackets
Tabulators
If this is enabled, the editor will calculate the number of spaces up to the next tab position as defined by the tab width, and insert that number of spaces instead of a TAB character.
& Insert spaces instead of tabulators
The editor will display a symbol to indicate the presence of a tab in the text.
& Highlight tabulators
Tab width:
Static Word Wrap
Automatically start a new line of text when the current line exceeds the length specified by the Wrap words at: option. This option does not wrap existing lines of text - use the Apply Static Word Wrap option in the Tools menu for that purpose. If you want lines to be visually wrapped instead, according to the width of the view, enable Dynamic Word Wrap in the View Defaults config page.
Enable static & word wrap
If this option is checked, a vertical line will be drawn at the word wrap column as defined in the Editing properties. Note that the word wrap marker is only drawn if you use a fixed pitch font.
Show static word wrap marker (if applicable)
Wrap words at:
If the Word Wrap option is selected this entry determines the length (in characters) at which the editor will automatically start a new line.
Misc
If this is enabled, the editor will remove any trailing whitespace on lines when they are left by the insertion cursor.

Memory Usage
Maximum loaded & blocks per file:
The editor will load given number of blocks (of around 2048 lines) of text into memory; if the filesize is bigger than this the other blocks are swapped to disk and loaded transparently as-needed. This can cause little delays while navigating in the document; a larger block count increases the editing speed at the cost of memory. For normal usage, just choose the highest possible block count: limit it only if you have problems with the memory usage.
