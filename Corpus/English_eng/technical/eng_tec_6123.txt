The Viewer
The reason for you to put all your images into & kphotoalbum;, and spending hours after hours describing them, is of course that you at some point want to look at them. For that purpose & kphotoalbum; has an viewer capable of showing your images and videos. You open the viewer from the thumbnail view as described in.
The viewer can be seen in. The viewer does of course show you the image, but in addition to that it also shows you the information you specified for each image, including, who is on the images, where and when it was takes etc.
In case the info box is located on top of part of the images you actually want to see, you can simply grab it with the mouse, and move it elsewhere on the image. It is possible to configure what should be shown in the info box, and of course whether it should be shown at all. All these options are available by right clicking your mouse on the viewer. The context menu can be seen in below.
The viewer's context menu
Some of the words in the info box is underlines. If you click the mouse on one of these words the browser (see) will go into scope of that item. Thus if you click on Anne Helene the browser will show you all images of Anne Helene, just as it would have done if you selected People from the root of the browser, and next selected Anne Helene.
In the info box you can see a small button with the & kphotoalbum; logo. Pressing that button will get you to the thumbnail viewer. The thumbnail view will display all images, and the image you just had in the viewer will be selected. The idea behind this is the following: you browse to a given person, and look at the images of that person. One of the images is from say your high school time, and now you want to see images from that period of time. Using the Jump to Context button, you are brought to the thumbnail view showing all images, with the current one being in focus, and likely all your high school pictures around it.
In case you have loaded several images into the viewer, you can go forth and back using Page Up and Page Down. You can go to the first and last images using Home and End. These functions are of course also available from the context menu.
If several images was loaded into the viewer, you can ask it to run them as a slide show, which means that & kphotoalbum; loads a new image every few second. How often it loads a new image is configure by pressing the control key and respective plus (for go faster) or minus (go slower). Starting and stopping the slide show is done simply by pressing Ctrl; S.
A very useful feature of the & kphotoalbum; viewer is it ability to go into full screen mode. In this mode, the viewer is using the complete screen space, simply press the return key to make it go into and out of full screen mode.
Using the viewer, you may zoom in and out of your image, simply by dragging out a rectangle with the mouse. Pressing the minus key will zoom out again. Pressing the plus key will zoom in at the center of the image. below shows how a zoom rectangle is marked, and shows the result of the zoom.
Pressing the period key, lets you reset zooming, so the image is shown unzoomed. Pressing the equal sign will set the zoom level so each pixel on the screen correspond to a pixel in the image.
Notice, for technical the only zooming operation that works when watching videos are zoom in and out (the plus and minus key).
Zooming in the viewer
Choosing the rotate operations from the context menu, you may rotate the image (Does not work for videos). You can annotate the current image, simply by choosing Annotate in the context menu.
Setting Tokens from the Viewer
When viewing the images you may find that a given image contains a person whose name you forgot to set on the images. At this time you may cancel your viewing, and rush to the image config dialog to specify the person. However, you may prefer to just tag the image and continue on viewing images.
An alternative situation is if you want to sent a number of images to a printer to get them developed on paper. To see which you want, you start the viewer on the images, and tag them as good or bad while by inspecting see each one.
For the above two examples the viewer offers you to set tokens on the images when viewing them. Tokens are named from A to Z, and you set a token simply by pressing its letter. In you may see an image where the tokens A, B and C are set.
An Image with Tokens
Once you've set tokens on your images, they will be available for regular browsing in the browser, as can be seen in. So when you've marked images that needs to be edited, printed, or whatever, simply browse to the images, and annotate all images at a time (as described in), use a plugin to copy the selected images to a CD, or whatever you need to do.
Tokens seen in the Browser
Categories (and esp tokens) may be displayed in the thumbnail viewer. When Showing the categories in the thumbnail viewer, you may also add tokens to images, simply by pressing the letter for the token when the image is selected, this can be seen in
Tokens seen in the Thumbnail Viewer
Drawing on Images
Sometimes it might not be obvious what you want to show with a given image, for that purpose & kphotoalbum; allows you to draw on the images.
The actual drawing is not saved to the image, but rather to the database, that way you can undo your drawing at a later point.
In you can see an image drawn on. To bring & kphotoalbum; in to drawing mode, select Draw on Image from the context menu. To quit drawing, press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.
