EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
EQUILIS PREQUENZA TE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Equilis Prequenza Te?
Equilis Prequenza Te is a vaccine for use in horses.
It contains parts (subunits) of three equine influenza (flu) strains (‘ A/ equine-1/ Prague/ 1/ 56’, ‘ A/ equine-2/ Newmarket/ 1/ 93’ and ‘ A/ equine- 2/ Newmarket/ 2/ 93’) and tetanus toxoid (chemically inactivated toxin from the tetanus bacterium).
The vaccine is available as a suspension for injection.
What is Equilis Prequenza Te used for?
Equilis Prequenza Te is used to vaccinate horses from six months of age against equine influenza and tetanus.
The vaccine reduces the signs of equine influenza and the excretion (shedding) of the virus after infection.
Equine influenza is a highly contagious disease that is very common in horses but that rarely causes death.
The vaccine also stimulates protection against tetanus to prevent mortality.
Tetanus is an acute, often fatal disease caused by the neurotoxin of the bacterium Clostridium tetani.
The disease, which usually originates from contaminated wounds, is characterised by overall rigidity (stiffness) and convulsive spasms of the muscles.
Horses belong to the most susceptible species to tetanus.
The vaccine is given as an injection into a muscle.
Horses should receive a primary vaccination, consisting of two injections given four weeks apart.
To retain protection, horses need to be revaccinated.
For protection against equine influenza, the first revaccination should be five months after primary vaccination, followed by yearly revaccinations.
For protection against tetanus, the first revaccination should be no later than 17 months after primary vaccination.
Afterwards, a maximum interval of two years is recommended.
How does Equilis Prequenza Te work?
Equilis Prequenza Te contains fragments (subunits) of the influenza viruses against which the vaccine is indicated for.
These fragments provoke a protective response of the immune system (the body ’ s natural defences) but cannot cause the disease.
The vaccine also contains purified tetanus toxoid.
The toxoid is a toxin processed in order to remove its toxic effect, but retain its antigenic properties.

Vaccines work by ‘ teaching’ the immune system how to defend itself against diseases.
When the product is given to horses, it helps the animals’ immune system to react quicker when the animal is naturally exposed to the equine influenza virus and the Clostridium tetani bacterium.
This helps to protect against equine influenza and tetanus.
The vaccine also contains an ‘ adjuvant’ to stimulate a better immune response.
How has Equilis Prequenza Te been studied?
The safety of Equilis Prequenza Te was studied in several studies under laboratory and field conditions in a large number of horses, from 2 months of age.
It was concluded that the product is well tolerated by horses of different ages.
Equilis Prequenza Te was also studied in pregnant mares.
No negative influence on gestation, foaling and offspring of mares was observed after vaccination at different times during pregnancy.
The effectiveness of Equilis Prequenza Te has been studied in several trials under laboratory and field conditions.
For ethical reasons no challenge (infection) experiment was performed against tetanus.
The main measure of effectiveness of Equilis Prequenza Te against equine influenza was the production of protective levels of antibodies against the influenza components.
The studies also compared the clinical signs and virus excretion of a group of vaccinated animals with those of a control group, (i. e. which did not receive the vaccine or received a competitive product).
Regarding tetanus, the main measure of effectiveness was the production of protective levels of antibodies against tetanus toxoid.
What benefit has Equilis Prequenza Te shown during the studies?
The studies showed that Equilis Prequenza Te is an effective vaccine against equine influenza to reduce clinical signs and virus excretion after infection, and against tetanus to prevent mortality, in horses from 6 months of age.
Horses developed protective levels of antibodies two weeks after primary vaccination.
The duration of protection was five months after primary vaccination and 12 months after the first revaccination for equine influenza and 17 months after primary vaccination and 24 months after the first revaccination for tetanus.
What is the risk associated with Equilis Prequenza Te?
Swelling (max. diameter 5 cm) may occur at the injection site, either as a diffuse hard or soft swelling.
The swelling is expected to decrease within two days.
Pain at the injection site can occur occasionally.
In some cases fever may occur for one day, and up to three days in exceptional circumstances.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the doctor.
What is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption (withdrawal period)?
The withdrawal period of the product is zero days.
What is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption?
Zero days.
Page 2/ 3 ©EMEA 2008 Why has Equilis Prequenza Te been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of Equilis Prequenza Te exceeded the risks for the immunisation of horses from six months of age against equine influenza to reduce clinical signs and virus excretion after infection and against tetanus to prevent mortality.
The Committee recommended that Equilis Prequenza Te should be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
