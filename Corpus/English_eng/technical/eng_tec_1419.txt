Microsoft Office
Specifies the settings for importing and exporting Microsoft Office OLE objects.
These settings are valid when no Microsoft OLE server exists (for example, in UNIX) or when there is no $[officename] OLE server ready for editing the OLE objects.
If an OLE server is active for the embedded object, then the OLE server will be used to handle the object.
If no OLE server is active for MathType objects, then embedded MathType objects can be converted to %PRODUCTNAME Math objects.
For this conversion, the embedded MathType objects must not exceed the MathType 3.1 specifications.
