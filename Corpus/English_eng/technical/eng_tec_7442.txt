GNOME Packages
Packages allows you to install and remove packages on your system. You can view and search packages by name, details or even file name and also see dependencies of one package on other packages. Searching by groups is possible and is an easy way to find software in your favorite desktop environment.
Packages uses PackageKit and can work on any distribution using the native package management framework.
GNOME Package Updater
Package Updater allows you to update packages on your system without rebooting. You can view details about each update and choose which updates to apply.
