This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP on HP-UX systems.
Example 3-1.
Installation Instructions for HP-UX 10
From: paul_mckay@clearwater-it.co.uk 04-Jan-2001 09:49 (These tips are for PHP 4.0.4 and Apache v1.3.9) So you want to install PHP and Apache on a HP-UX 10.20 box?
1.
You need gzip, download a binary distribution from http: / /hpux.connect.org.uk / ftp / hpux / Gnu / gzip-1.2.4a / gzip-1.2.4a-sd-10.20.depot.Z uncompress the file and install using swinstall 2.
You need gcc, download a binary distribution from http: / /gatekeep.cs.utah.edu / ftp / hpux / Gnu / gcc-2.95.2 / gcc-2.95.2-sd-10.20.depot.gz gunzip this file and install gcc using swinstall.
3.
You need the GNU binutils, you can download a binary distribution from http: / /hpux.connect.org.uk / ftp / hpux / Gnu / binutils-2.9.1 / binutils-2.9.1-sd-10.20.depot.gz gunzip and install using swinstall.
4.
You now need bison, you can download a binary distribution from http: / /hpux.connect.org.uk / ftp / hpux / Gnu / bison-1.28 / bison-1.28-sd-10.20.depot.gz install as above.
5.
You now need flex, you need to download the source from one of the http: / /www.gnu.org mirrors.
It is in the filename non-gnu / filename directory of the ftp site.
Download the file, gunzip, then tar -xvf it.
Go into the newly created flex directory and do a. / configure, then a make, and then a make install If you have errors here, it 's probably because gcc etc. are not in your PATH so add them to your PATH.
Right, now into the hard stuff.
6.
Download the PHP and apache sources.
7. gunzip and tar -xvf them.
We need to hack a couple of files so that they can compile ok.
8.
Firstly the configure file needs to be hacked because it seems to lose track of the fact that you are a hpux machine, there will be a better way of doing this but a cheap and cheerful hack is to put lt_target=hpux10.20 on line 47286 of the configure script.
9.
Next, the Apache GuessOS file needs to be hacked.
Under apache_1.3.9 / src / helpers change line 89 from "echo "hp${HPUXMACH}-hpux${HPUXVER}"; exit 0" to: "echo "hp${HPUXMACH}-hp-hpux${HPUXVER}"; exit 0 "10.
You cannot install PHP as a shared object under HP-UX so you must compile it as a static, just follow the instructions at the Apache page.
11.
PHP and apache should have compiled OK, but Apache won 't start. you need to create a new user for Apache, eg www, or apache.
You then change lines 252 and 253 of the conf / httpd.conf in Apache so that instead of User nobody Group nogroup you have something like User www Group sys This is because you can 't run Apache as nobody under hp-ux.
Apache and PHP should then work.
Hope this helps somebody, Paul Mckay.
