Introduction
& keurocalc; is an universal pocket currency converter and calculator.
On the 1st of January, 2002, 12 European countries united their national currencies into a single one, the euro (€). The same happens from time to time on a smaller scale with new European countries. & keurocalc; helps:
During the transition periods
To verify one's bank account, when paying both in euros and in the old currency (Italian liras, for example).
To verify one's shopping, and compute the change if paying with a banknote labeled in the old currency.
Many years after the transition periods
To get an idea of the value of the things in the old currency at any stage of calculations.
At any time
To do conversions between the euro and other currencies, like the British Pound, according to the daily exchange rate defined by the European Central Bank (ECB).
To do conversions between any two currencies that are part of the list published the ECB.
To do conversions between the US dollar and other currencies according to the daily exchange rate defined by the New York Federal Reserve Bank (NY FRB).
To do conversions between any two currencies that are part of the list published the NY FRB.
& keurocalc; has the following advantages in term of comfort and usability:
You see every intermediate value and the result in both the reference currency (euro or dollar) and in the other currency.
There is a separate input area where you can type a new value while still having the previous result visible.
The ergonomy is very close to usual pocket calculators, despite the fact that any value you type can be a value in the reference currency (euro or dollar), a value in the other currency, a percentage or an unit-less quantity.
You press the keys in the order you would speak aloud what you're doing.
If you make mistakes, a special correction button enables you to correct your last input data, as long as you did n't validate.
The numbers are displayed according to your locale settings: with either a comma or a dot as a decimal point, according to your & kcontrol; settings.
You can decide which reference currency you want to use (euro or dollar), which other currency to start with when you launch & keurocalc;, and which rounding method to use.
& keurocalc; allows the following operations:
Conversions from and to the reference currency (euro or dollar).
Systematic rounding of the displayed result, but computations done internally with the precision of the mathematical libraries.
Usual additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions.
Apply a percentage, add a percentage, or subtract a percentage.
Possibility to store values in an intermediate memory, or use that memory as a running total.
Here are some limitations of & keurocalc;:
No parenthesized or complex expressions.
Some roundings go wrong due to the limitations of the mathematical library.
Inflationist currencies cannot be handled due to limited display size. However, with the change to the new Turkish lira and the removal of six zeroes in that currency, it is not a practical problem anymore.
New York Federal Reserve Bank rates are not available during the non-working days (Christmas, Easter, etc.).
& keurocalc; never guarantees the exactness of the exchange rates nor the accuracy of the result. You are always invited to verify your computations by some other means. As the license agreement states, there's no liability of the authors if the results are not correct or as expected. Also, please notice that the variable exchange rates are downloaded in an unencrypted and therefore insecure manner from the data sources (European Central Bank and New York Federal Reserve Bank). Some man-in-the-middle attacker may confuse & keurocalc; by forging exchange rates. More simply, a transmission error is always possible.
Using & keurocalc;
Performing Conversions
To convert 1000 Belgian francs into euros
Select the BEF - Belgian franc (francs belges) item in the currencies drop down list on the bottom. If that choice is not available, press the Settings... button and select Euro, no network access (fixed rates only) to make the correct rates list appear.
Type 1000 on the keyboard or use the corresponding numerical buttons. The digits appear while you are typing them in the Input display. If you make a mistake while typing the digits use the & Backspace; key or the lt; - button.
Press the FB button or the F key. In fact, any key that is not already reserved for some other usage will validate the input as a number expressed in the currency, so B or X would have worked as well.
Read the result in the Result display on the right: 24.79 €or 24,79 €according to our locale settings.
To convert 25 euros into Belgian francs
If the fixed rates currencies are available, select the BEF - Belgian franc item in the currencies drop down list on the bottom. You can skip this step if it's already the selected currency.
Type 25.
Read the result in the Result display on the right: 1008.50 FB or 1008,50 FB. The exact value is 1008.4975, but it's rounded to the closest hundredth of a Belgian franc. The rounding unit depends on the currency and on the rounding method: with the official rounding rules, for Belgian francs it's 0.01 FB, for Italian liras it's 1 L for example.
You could also have typed: 25 Enter E.
To convert 120 German marks into Spanish pesetas
If the fixed rates currencies are available, select the DEM - German deutschmark item in the currencies drop down list.
Type 120.
Press the DM button or the D or M keys.
Just select the ESP - Spanish peseta item to see the same amount of 61.36€ converted into pesetas in the Result area.
Adding and Subtracting
How much is 3 + 5?
Type 3 and then press +. Notice that in the result field, 3 is a simple value displayed on just one line, with no monetary unit.
Type 5 and then press the Enter button or the & Enter; key. The result 8 appears on the right.
You received 100 US dollars and paid 32.50 euros for a book, how much do you have left in your bank account?
Make sure that the variable exchange rates are available. If not, press the Settings... to select either Euro, European Central Bank or Dollar, New York Federal Reserve Bank. Now select the USD - US dollar or the EUR - EU euro item in the scroll down list on the bottom. If you have no Internet access, that item wo n't be available as the latest variable rates between the euro and the dollar cannot be determined.
Type 100 and then press $.
Press the - button or the - key. Notice the - sign in the leftmost part of the Input display.
Read the result in the Result display on the right. The exact value might depend on latest exchange rates. Notice that during the whole computation you've been able to read the values both in euro and in US dollars. Pay attention to the fact that different data sources (ECB or NY FRB) might not provide the same conversion rate between the euro and the dollar.
You pay a 32.50€ book with a 500 FF banknote. How much was the clerk supposed to give you back, in euro notes and coins?
Select the FRF - French francs item in the currencies drop down list if not already selected.
Press the - button or the - key.
Type 500 and press the FF button or the F key.
Do not try to add euros to simple values (with no currency unit): it wo n't work, for the same reason you cannot add 5 meters to 3 kilograms.
Multiplying and Dividing
You buy 3.2 kilograms of apples at 2 €per kilogram. How much does the whole cost in Australian dollars?
Select the AUD - Australian dollar item if available and if not already selected.
Press the X button or the * key. Notice the X sign at the left of the Input display.
Now type 3.2 followed by the Enter button or the & Enter; key: this means 3.2 units at 2 €each.
It's not possible to multiply X euros by Y dollars, just as you do n't multiply 10 fingers by 2 ears.
Using Percentages
How much is 20% of 3000 yen?
Select the JPY - Japanese yen item if available and if not already selected.
Type 3000 and press the ¥button or the Y key.
Enter 20 and press the% button or the% key. As with multiplications, the value had to be typed before the percentage.
Look at the result: it is equivalent to 600 yen.
How much is 3000 yen plus 20%?
Press the + button or the + key.
Look at the result: 26.96€ or 3600 ¥at the time of writing.
How much is 3000 yen minus 20%?
Press the - button or - key.
Look at the result: 17.97€ or 2400 ¥at the date of writing these lines.
Using Intermediate Memory
How do I store now and recall later some value?
Do your computations.
Press Min (Memory in) button to store the value in the Result area. Please notice that the other memory keys now become available.
Do some other work with the calculator.
Recall the value from the memory by pressing the MR (Memory Recall) button.
Internally, the values are recalled with no unit or in the reference currency (euro or dollar) with the maximum precision allowed by the mathematical library. In some rare cases, this might lead to rounding problems if the stored value is a rounded value in a non-reference currency.
How do I clear the memory?
Press the Reset button. Please notice that the Reset clears everything: the input, the result and the memory.
How do I compute 3.1 * 5.2€ + 2.7 * 8.9€?
Store the result in memory with Min button.
Add the result to the memory with M+ button.
Recall the sum with MR button.
There are other solutions like 3.1 * 5.2€ Min 2.7 * 8.9€ + MR.
How do I compute 3.1 * 5.2 €- 2.7 * 8.9€?
Subtract the result from the memory with M- button.
The sequence 3.1 * 5.2€ Min 2.7 * 8.9€ - MR computes the difference in the reverse order.

The Settings Dialog
Reference currency, rates origin
This setting defines the reference currency (euro or dollar), and from where & keurocalc; should download the exchange rates between the reference currency and other currencies. The following choices are available:
Euro, no network access (fixed rates only)
Euro is the reference currency. No variable rate is downloaded or used. The only available currencies are the ones that have a fixed conversion rate with the euro.
This setting is adapted to computers with no network access.
Euro, European Central Bank
Euro is the reference currency. The fixed exchange rates are available. & keurocalc; attempts to download the variable rates from the European Central Bank (ECB).
Dollar, New York Federal Reserve Bank
Dollar is the reference currency. There are no fixed exchange rates. & keurocalc; attempts to download the variable rates from the New York Federal Reserve Bank (NY FRB).
Currently, & keurocalc; has a problem determining the date of the latest exchange rates published by that bank, because of time zone offsets and non-working days. For safety, & keurocalc; always asks for yesterday's rates, which is of course not optimal.
Default currency
This setting defines the other currency that is used when & keurocalc; starts up or when the user validates the new settings.
Notice that the selected currency might not be provided by the selected rates source. In that case, the first available currency in the list is used.
Rounding
This setting defines how the results should be presented in the display area. Internally, all computations are done with the precision offered by the mathematical library, but it usually makes no sense presenting tenths of cents. The following rounding methods are available:
Official rounding rules
The EU conversion rules or other official conversion rules are used. It means that the result is rounded to the next unit for currencies like the Japanese yen or the Italian lira, and rounded to the next hundredth of unit (cents) for currencies like the euro or the dollar.
For example, 158.323 yen would be rounded to 158 yen. 12.537 euro would be rounded to 12.54 euro.
Smallest coin method
The result is rounded to the next value of the smallest coin that circulates in the country that uses that currency. For disappeared currencies like the Italian lira, it uses the smallest coin that used to circulate before the currency has been withdrawn: in the case of the Italian lira, it was the 50 liras coin.
For example, 1235.9 Italian liras would be rounded to 1250 liras. 39.45 Norwegian crowns would be rounded to 39.50 crowns.
We lack information about the smallest coins that exist in every country. Please send a bug report if & keurocalc; uses an incorrect value for the smallest available coin in your country, and we will enter that information.
No rounding at all
The computed value is displayed unchanged, as a floating point number.
Look and feel
This setting defines the appearance and behavior of & keurocalc;. The following options are available:
Display color
The background color of the display areas (both input and result). To change the background color, click on Change.... This opens the standard & kde; color selection dialog. Choose a new color, then press OK to validate the new choice.
Enable splash screen
Uncheck this box if you do not want to initial picture to appear when & keurocalc; starts.
