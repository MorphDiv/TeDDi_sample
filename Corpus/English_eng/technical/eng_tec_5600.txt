Configuring & kexi;
This chapter describes how you can configure & kexi; to suit your own needs and preferences.
Window Layout
& kexi; provides a Multiple Document Interface (MDI). This means that you can have several database objects (such as tables, queries, forms and scripts) open at the same time and in the same & kexi; main window. Each database object is shown in a child window within the main window.
There is a choice of two MDI modes available, allowing a choice of how child windows are managed and displayed. The two modes are: IDEAl Mode; and Childframe Mode. These modes are described in the following two sections. You can change the MDI mode from the MDI Mode sub-menu under the Window menu. Note that changing the MDI mode requires & kexi; to be restarted before the new mode takes effect.
IDEAl mode
IDEAl mode is the default MDI mode, and may be familiar from other & kde; applications. In this mode, a single child window is shown maximized within the & kexi; main window at once. A tab bar, containing one tab for each child window, allows other child windows to be viewed by simply clicking on the relevant tab.
Childframe mode
In Childframe mode, child windows are displayed in the main & kexi; window, but need not be maximized within it. In order to use Childframe mode, you need to select Window, MDI Mode, Childframe Mode from the menu.
Each child window has a title bar with buttons for maximizing, minimizing and closing it. They can also be moved and resized within the main window in the normal way (for example, they can be moved by clicking and dragging the title bar).
The buttons behave as follows: the right-most button closes the child window. The button on its left maximizes the child window - note this causes the buttons to move to the top right of the main window, above the Properties editor if it is open. The next button to the left toggles the child window between minimized and restored.
The left-most button detaches, or undocks, the child window, allowing it to be moved out of the main window. For more information on docking and undocking windows, see the next section.
Docking and Undocking Windows
By default, the Project Navigator and Properties Editor panels are displayed as part of the main & kexi; window. It is possible to undock each panel, so that it is displayed in a separate window. Once undocked, it is possible to dock the panel so it appears back in the main window again.
In Childframe mode, it is also possible to undock child windows. For example, a child window showing a database table could be undocked, allowing the child window showing the table to be maximized on the screen.
It can be useful to undock a window when using:
a small screen;
large tables, queries or forms; and/ or
more than one monitor.
Docking and undocking side panels
The Project Navigator and Properties Editor side panels may be undocked by either:
double-clicking on the'grip 'bar at the top of the panel; or
clicking once on the arrow at the top of the panel, next to the cross.
Once undocked, panel windows may be docked into the main window again similarly to undocking:
double-clicking on the'grip 'bar at the top of the window; or
Docking and undocking child windows
Child windows may be docked and undocked in Childframe mode only.
In Childframe mode, child windows may be undocked by:
right-clicking in the tab bar, on the tab corresponding to the window to be undocked, and selecting Undock; or
right-clicking on the title bar of the child window, and selecting Undock; or
if the child window is not maximized, clicking the arrow in the top right corner of the child window (next to the minimize, maximize and close buttons for that child window);
if the child window is maximized, clicking the arrow to the right of the menu bar (next to the minimize, restore and close buttons for that child window).
To dock a child window, right-clicking in the tab bar, on the tab corresponding to the window to be docked, and select Dock.
