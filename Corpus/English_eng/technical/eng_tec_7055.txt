New Projects
The & quantaplus; project wizard (Project New Project...) makes project creation an easy task.
The Project Wizard.
The fields are pretty straight forward. It is best to fill them in from top to bottom. Filling in a project name will autocomplete all the folder structure for the rest of the project. All of the paths and author information fields can be configured later on clicking Shift; F7 Project.
General Project Settings
Name
Here you fill in the name for your project. For example, we will call ours foo. When you fill in Name, File is filled out for you automatically.
File
This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. By default, it is the name of your project, but in lowercase letters and without spaces. It uses the extension webprj (eg; foo. webprj). This file is stored in the root of the project's Main Folder.
Server Settings
Protocol
Here you select the protocol you will be using to access your project. If your project is on the same machine that you are using Quanta Plus on, then leave the value at Local. The list of protocols shown here is dependent of your system setup. Available protocols include SSH, FTP, NFS, SMB, WebDAV, and others. The protocol list is powered by & kde; 's powerful KIOSlave architecture. This framework allows every & kde; application to easily access remote information as if it is local to the machine.
Host
Here you fill in the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you are working through the Local protocol. Either a hostname (hostname. example. com) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) can go here.
User
User name for logging onto the remote machine. This is case-sensitive.
Password
Password for logging onto the remote machine. This is case-sensitive.
Port
Leave this field blank to use the default port for the protocol you are using. You may need to change this depending on your server's configuration.
Directory Settings
Main directory
This is the root folder where all of the project files and folders will be stored.
Templates directory
This is where the templates for this project will be stored. It is a relative path to the project and by default, it points to templates. If you have a common set of files that you use for several projects, then it may be useful to point this field to it, instead of to the default.
Toolbars directory
This is where the toolbars for this project will be stored. It is a relative path to the project and by default, it points to toolbars. If you have a common set of toolbars that you use for several projects, it may be useful to point this there instead of the default.
Project Sources
Add local or remote files
This allows you to get files from the local file system. You can choose multiple files or entire folders.
Use wget to download files from site
This option is great if you have static web content that you wish to download and modify. For server side scripting (eg; & PHP;, Python, & etc;.) you will have to get the files another way.
Insert Files in Project
Insert file from
Check this if you wish to include files found in the path of the Main Folder. Leave unchecked when starting a project from scratch.
Filters
Insert only markup, script and image files
Choosing this option will only insert markup, script, and image files into your project.
Insert files with the following mask
Choosing this option will display all files and folders within the Main Folder and allow you to be more specific with your choices.
Included files
This displays a list of the files in the Main Folder. You can choose the desired files for inclusion, by checking, or exclusion, by unchecking, in your project.
More Project Settings
Author
Insert your name (or alias) here.
Email
The address where you would like email regarding this project to go.
Project Defaults
Default DTD
Choose the markup language you will be working with the most within this project.
Default encoding
Choose the character encoding you wish the files in your project to be opened and saved with.
Use preview prefix
Check this to use a prefix for your previews. This allows you to set the path prefix to something other than your local file system. This is most useful for pages that contain dynamic content and are dependent on server processing (like & PHP;, JSS, Python, & etc;). Simply type in the first portion of the address as it exists on that server and the filepath at the end will be complete by & quantaplus;. For example, if you have the domain bar. com and you are editing the index. html page, you could edit it on your remote machine (foo. bar. com), upload it to the server and press F6 to see the results from www. bar. com instead of your local file system.
Prefix
Enter the prefix you wish to use here.
Insert global templates
This makes a copy of the global templates in your projects folder tree.
Insert local templates
This makes a copy of the local templates in your projects folder tree.
The last screen of the new project wizard has 3 settings that can make your life easier. These settings are available for change from the Project Project Properties menu tree on the Upload Profiles Tab or with the keyboard shortcut Shift; F7.
Configuring Projects
The project properties dialog looks like:
The general options page
Some of the items are the same as in the project wizard and are described in. The extra items are described below.
Exclude from project
A list of file names (wildcards can be used) that will be ignored when you do project related operations like Rescan Project Folder.
Exclude files listed in. cvsignore
A complementary option to the above one, also files listed in the. cvsignore file will be excluded from the project.
Default view
The project view that will be loaded when the project is opened. You can read more about project views in.
Debugger
Select the debugger you want to use. Currently only Gubed is support. You can find more information about Gubed at. The debugger plugin can be configured with the Options button. Read to learn more about debugging.
On the Upload Profiles page you can configure the upload profiles (see), as well as enable the showing of a treeview with the content of the server for each profile by checking the Show a treeview for each profile checkbox.
On the Team Configuration page you can add, edit and remove members of the project as well as define a mailing list. Read for details.
On the Event Configuration page you can Enable the event actions, add, modify and remove these actions. Event actions are executed when some predefined event occurs, like saving a file. See for details.
Using Projects
Project Files
By default & quantaplus; will open the last project accessed when launched. This behavior is not currently configurable.
To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Open Project icon on the toolbar. The open project dialog will pop up and allow you to choose the project you wish. Projects have a webprj extension.
When closing & quantaplus;, your project file will be saved automatically. You will be asked to save any changes before exiting if & quantaplus; detects any changed files. This same behavior occurs if you load a new project.
The Project Tree View
The project tree view gives you uncluttered access to the files in your project. This is where you manage the files in the current project.
For files, a & RMB; click brings up the following menu:
These items are fairly self-explanatory and will be left to the reader for exploration.
Folders are similar but do not contain the Open and Open With... & RMB; menu items:
These items are left to the reader for exploration as well.
Uploading Projects
The Upload Project dialog:
The Upload Project dialog.
Profile name
This is where different profiles can be chosen. The profile contains information on where the uploaded files are to be placed. Read.
New
This button allows you to create new upload profiles.
Edit
This allows you to edit the currently selected upload profile.
Remove
This allows you to remove the current profile. If only one profile is available the button is grayed out to prevent its removal.
Keep passwords in memory
The password is stored in memory and is lost as soon as the program is closed. This option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and you do not want to use the more insecure Store password on disc option.
All
Select all files in your project for upload.
Modified
Select all modified files for upload.
None
Unselects all files in the list.
Invert
Selects/ Unselects all files in the list.
Expand All
Expands all folders.
Collapse All
Collapses all folders.
Update All
Refreshes list.
Proceed
Start the upload
Cancel
This will abort your transfer in progress or just exit out of the dialog if you change your mind before starting the upload.
Upload profiles
With & quantaplus; you can define multiple upload profiles and, in this way, upload your project (or parts of your project) to different servers. When you edit or create a profile you will face the following dialog:
Enter the name you wish to give your profile here.
This is the hostname of the server you are copying the files to. Either a fully qualified domain name, or an IP address is needed.
Transfer protocol to use for this upload. Depending on your version of & kde; this list will vary. At the very least you should be able to choose from & FTP;, file (ie; local) and NFS.
Port for the transfer. Usually this will not need to be changed unless your network administrator is hosting a service on a port other than its well known port.
Username to use for authentication.
Password to use for authentication.
Store password on disc
Depending on your level of paranoia, this is a time saving feature, or a danger. Use it at your discretion. The password is kept on disk as text in an obscured form, so it's not simple to read it, but anyone with programming knowledge can easily un-obscure it.
Path
This is the base path on the remote host that you will be copying files to.
Use as default profile
Allows you to mark the profile currently being viewed as the default.
Project Views
A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. You can have multiple views in a project, meaning that by simply changing the view you can load several files and toolbars which will replace the currently opened files and toolbars.
Views can be saved, opened, deleted using the Project menu or the Project Toolbar, accessible via Settings Toolbars Project Toolbar.
You can have a default view (loaded when the project is opened). See.
