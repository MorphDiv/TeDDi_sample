This manual describes version 2.15 of Disk Usage Analyzer.
Feedback
To report a bug or make a suggestion regarding the Disk Usage Analyzer application or this manual, follow the directions in the
Disk Usage Analyser
Introduction

It also auto-detects in real-time any changes made to your home directory as far as any mounted/unmounted device.
Getting Started

from Gnome menu
from a terminal window;
from Nautilus "Open with..." ;
If you want to start

If launched from Gnome menu,
When you start
Disk Usage Analyzer Window
Shows Disk Usage Analyzer main window. Contains menubar, display area, scrollbars, and statusbar.
The user can then:
start a full filesystem scan;
select a specific local directory branch to scan
select a remote server and folder to scan
set preferences
Usage
Full filesystem scan
To start a full filesystem scan select
When the scanning process ends up, you will get the full tree of your filesystem, like the one in the next Figure.
Disk Usage Analyzer Full filesystem scan
Shows Disk Usage Analyzer full filesystem scan window. Contains menubar, display area, scrollbars, and statusbar.
When you run a full filesystem scan,


Hard-links are managed in a different way: this first hardlink is counted as a normal file, while the subsequent links to the same inode device are not counted in the total, but highlighted in the right-hand column of the window.
Single folder scan
To start a single folder scan select
Remote scan
If you need to scan a remote server-folder, just click on the toolbar icon
Disk Usage Analyzer Remote folder scan
Shows Disk Usage Analyzer remote folder dialog window.
Preferences
To change the
Disk Usage Analyzer Preferences Window
Preferences window
Select devices to be scanned
In the first part of the Preferences window, all detected mounted devices are listed. Click on the checkbox to include/exclude the partition into the filesystem scanning operations.
The device mounted on "/" cannot be excluded from the scan.
Enable monitoring of home
If this option is checked,
Treemaps

Disk Usage Analyzer Treemap Window
Treemap's theory. Shows 2 treemap diagrams
Figure shows an example of treemap's theory. Each node (as shown in the tree diagram) has a name (a letter) and an associated size (a number). The size of leaves may represent for instance the size of individual files, the size of non-leaf nodes is the sum of the sizes of its children.
The treemap is constructed via recursive subdivision of the initial rectangle. The size of each sub-rectangle corresponds to the size of the node. The direction of subdivision alternates per level: first horizontally, next vertically, etcetera. As a result, the initial rectangle is partitioned into smaller rectangles, such that the size of each rectangle reflects the size of the leaf. The structure of the tree is also reflected in the treemap, as a result of its construction. Color and annotation can be used to give extra information about the leaves.
Treemaps are very effective when size is the most important feature to be displayed.
Ringschart

After launching the application, it is showed the file system usage. Graphical representation on the right.
When you start scanning a folder, the tree of subfolders is created and listed on the left side. Each row contains information for the name, how much space it is taking up (percentage and size in KB, MB or GB) and the number of items (adding files and directories). When this process ends up, the

You can go up and down the rows in the list (optionally expanding those with subfolders), the graphic representation will change using the selected folder as the root of the partial tree to be represented. The folders can also be navigated from the
The percentage of its parent's radius that is used by a given folder is directly proportional to the relation between it's own size and its parent's. It's easy to understand that the size of a folder is equal or smaller than its parent's. Although only directories are shown in this graphical representation, files are taken into account to calculate the amount of space occupied by folders.
