Note that in different countries touch typing is taught slightly different which usually affects only the top row of keys. For instance, in the United States only the leftmost key and the key with the 1 are pressed by the little finger of the left hand. In Germany the little finger also presses the 2 key, and thus the fingers shift one key to the right on the top row. Normally this only makes a difference for split or ergonomic keyboards.
