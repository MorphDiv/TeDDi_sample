(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
This function configures the CCL query parser for a target with definitions of access points (CCL qualifiers) and their mapping to RPN.
To map a specific CCL query to RPN afterwards call the yaz_ccl_parse() function.
Each index of the array config is the name of a CCL field and the corresponding value holds a string that specifies a mapping to RPN.
The mapping is a sequence of attribute-type, attribute-value pairs.
Attribute-type and attribute-value is separated by an equal sign (=).
Each pair is separated by white space.
Example 1.
CCL configuration
In the example below, the CCL parser is configured to support three CCL fields: ti, au and isbn.
Each field is mapped to their BIB-1 equivalent.
It is assumed that variable $id is the connection ID.
$fields[ "ti"] = "1=4"; $fields["au"] = "1=1"; $fields["isbn"] = "1=7"; yaz_ccl_conf($id,$fields);
