EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
VIREAD
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Viread?
Viread is a medicine containing the active substance tenofovir disoproxil, available as light blue almond-shaped tablets.
What is Viread used for?
Viread is an antiviral medicine.
It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
For patients who have taken medicines to treat HIV infection before, doctors should only prescribe Viread once they have looked at the antiviral medicines the patient has taken before or the likelihood of the virus ’ s response to antiviral medicines.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Viread used?
Treatment with Viread should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of HIV infection.
The recommended dose of Viread is one tablet taken once a day with food.
In exceptional cases, patients who have particular difficulty swallowing can crush the tablet in at least 100 ml of water, orange juice or grape juice, and drink the resulting suspension.
The dose may need to be adjusted in patients who have problems with their kidneys.
How does Viread work?
The active substance in Viread, tenofovir disoproxil, is a ‘ prodrug ’ that is converted into tenofovir in the body.
Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that blocks the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme produced by HIV that allows it to infect cells and make more viruses.
Viread, taken in combination with other antiviral medicines, reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.
Viread does not cure HIV infection or AIDS, but it may delay the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.
How has Viread been studied?
Viread has been studied in three main studies involving 1,343 HIV-infected adults.
The first two studies compared the effects of adding Viread to those of adding placebo (a dummy treatment) in 741 patients.
They had been taking HIV treatments for at least 4 years, but were not

The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the level of HIV in the blood (viral load), after 4 or 24 weeks of treatment.
The effects of Viread were also assessed in a study of 602 treatment-naïve patients (who had not taken HIV treatment before).
The study compared the effects of either Viread with those of stavudine (another antiviral medicine) when they were taken together with lamivudine and efavirenz (other antiviral medicines).
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients with viral loads below 400 copies/ ml after 48 weeks.
What benefit has Viread shown during the studies?
Viread, taken in combination with other antiviral medicines, caused a reduction in viral load.
In the first study of treatment-experienced patients, those adding Viread to their existing treatment had a fall in viral load of 76% after 4 weeks, compared to a rise of 4% in the placebo group.
Similar results were seen after 24 weeks.
The second study showed the same effect, with a 75% fall in the Viread group, compared to a fall 7% in those adding placebo, after 24 weeks.
In treatment-naïve patients, Viread was as effective as stavudine, with similar numbers of patients in the Viread and stavudine groups having viral loads below 400 copies/ ml after 48 weeks.
What is the risk associated with Viread?
The most common side effects when taking Viread (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, and hypophosphataemia (low levels of phosphate in the blood).
For the full list of side effects reported with Viread, see the Package Leaflet.
Viread should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to tenofovir, to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or to any of the other ingredients.
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Viread may be at risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).
Patients who have problems with their liver (including hepatitis B or C infection) may be at an elevated risk of liver damage when taking Viread.
As with all other NRTIs, Viread may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Viread during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
Why has Viread been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Viread’ s benefits are greater than its risks in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected patients over 18 years of age.
The committee noted that the benefit of Viread is based on one study of patients with high viral loads who had not received any antiviral treatment before, and studies in which Viread was added to existing HIV treatment that was not working.
The committee recommended that Viread be given marketing authorisation.
Viread was originally authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”, because, for scientific reasons, limited information was available at the time of approval.
As the company had supplied the additional information requested, the “ Exceptional Circumstances ” ended on 8 July 2005.
Other information about Viread:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Viread to Gilead Sciences International Limited on 5 February 2002.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 5 February 2007.
