Command:
This area contains the status messages for the game. Most of these messages are sent to you from the current engine.
This is the command line. You can type special commands related to the current engine in here. Most relevant commands are also available through the menus.
This is the button bar tool bar. It gives you easy access to game related commands. You can drag the bar to a different location within the window.
This is the status bar. It shows you the currently selected engine in the left corner.

After you finished your moves, they have to be sent to the engine. You can either do that manually (in which case you should not enable this feature), or you can specify an amount of time that has to pass before the move is committed. If you undo a move during the timeout, the timeout will be reset and restarted once you finish the move. This is very useful if you would like to review the result of your move.
Enable timeout
Move timeout in seconds:
Check the box to enable all the messages that you have previously disabled by choosing the "Do not show this message again" option.
Reenable all messages
Check the box to automatically save all window positions on program exit. They will be restored at next start.

You can enable the menubar again with the right mouse button menu of the board.

Set Dice Values
Set the face values of the selected dice. The other player's dice will be cleared and it will be the dice's owner's turn.
This is the bar of the backgammon board. Checkers that have been kicked from the board are put on the bar and remain there until they can be put back on the board. Checkers can be moved by dragging them to their destination or by using the'short move 'feature. If the cube has not been doubled yet and if it can be used, its face shows 64 and if the cube can be doubled, double clicking it will do so.
This is a regular field of the backgammon board. Checkers can be placed on this field and if the current state of the game and the dice permit this, they can be moved by dragging them to their destination or by using the'short move 'feature.
This part of the backgammon board is the home. Depending on the direction of the game, one of the homes contains the dice and the other one contains checkers that have been moved off the board. Checkers can never be moved away from the home. If this home contains the dice and the current state of the game permits this, double clicking on the dice will roll them. Moreover, the cube might be placed on the home bar and if it can be doubled, double clicking it will do so.
