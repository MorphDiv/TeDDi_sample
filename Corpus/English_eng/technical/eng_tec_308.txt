Solver
Opens the Solver dialogue box.
A solver allows to solve equations with multiple unknown variables by goal seeking methods.
target cell
Enter or click the cell reference of the target cell.
This field takes the address of the cell whose value is to be optimised.
maximum
Try to solve the equation for a maximum value of the target cell.
minimum
Try to solve the equation for a minimum value of the target cell.
value of
Try to solve the equation to approach a given value of the target cell.
value of text field
Enter the value or a cell reference.
by changing cells
Enter the cell range that can be changed.
cell reference
Enter a cell reference.
operators
Select an operator from the list.
value
Enter a value or a cell reference.
shrinker
Click to shrink or restore the dialogue box.
You can click or select cells in the sheet.
You can enter a cell reference manually in the input box.
delete row
Click to remove the row from the list.
Any rows from below this row move up.
options button
Opens the Options dialogue box.
solve button
Click to solve the equation with the current settings.
The dialogue box settings are retained until you close the current document.
To solve equations with the solver
target cell
, also named the &quot; objective &quot; .
You can choose whether the value in the target cell should be a maximum, a minimum, or approaching a given value.
By changing cells
box.
You can define a series of limiting conditions that set constraints for some cells.
For example, you can set the constraint that one of the variables or cells must not be bigger than another variable, or not bigger than a given value.
You can also define the constraint that one or more variables must be integers (values without decimals), or binary values (where only 0 and 1 are allowed).
The default solver engine supports only linear equations.
Add an example.
