Grouping Objects
You can combine several objects into a group so that they act as a single object.
You can move and transform all objects in a group as a single unit.
You can also change the properties (for example, line size, fill colour) of all objects in a group as a whole or for individual objects in a group.
Groups can be temporary or assigned:
Temporary - group only lasts as long as all of the combined objects are selected.
Assigned - group lasts until it is ungrouped through a menu command.
Groups can also be grouped in other groups.
Actions applied to a group do not affect the relative position of the individual objects to each other in the group.
To group objects:
Icon
Modify - Group
.
For example, you can group all of the objects in a company logo to move and resize the logo as a single object.
After you have grouped objects, selecting any part of the group selects the entire group.
Selecting Objects in a Group
Icon
You can select single objects in a group by entering the group.
Double-click a group to enter it and click on the object to select it.
You can also add or delete objects to and from a group in this mode.
The objects that are not part of the group are greyed out.
Icon
To exit a group, double-click anywhere outside it.
