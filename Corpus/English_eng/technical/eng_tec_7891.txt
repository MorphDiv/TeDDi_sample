EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ZERIT
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Zerit?
Zerit is a medicine containing the active substance stavudine.
It is available as capsules containing 15 mg (red and yellow), 20 mg (brown), 30 mg (light and dark orange) and 40 mg (dark orange) stavudine.
Zerit is also available as a powder to make up into an oral solution.
What is Zerit used for?
Zerit is an antiviral medicine.
It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Zerit used?
Treatment with Zerit should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of HIV infection.
The dose to use is calculated based on the age and weight of the patient.
It is taken every 12 hours.
Adults weighing less than 60 kg and children weighing over 30 kg take 30 mg, and adults over 60 kg take 40 mg.
Children over the age of 14 days receive 1 mg per kilogram body weight, unless they weigh more than 30 kg.
Babies less than 13 days old should be given 0.5 mg/ kg body weight.
Zerit should be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before a meal.
If this is not possible, it may be taken with a light meal.
The capsules should be swallowed whole or opened carefully and their contents mixed with food.
The oral solution should be used in patients below three months of age.
The dose may need to be adjusted in patients who have problems with their kidneys or certain side effects.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
How does Zerit work?
The active substance in Zerit, stavudine, is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).
It blocks the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme produced by HIV that allows it to infect cells in the body and make more viruses.
By blocking this enzyme, Zerit, taken in combination with other antiviral medicines, reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.
Zerit does not cure HIV infection or AIDS, but it may delay the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.

The effectiveness of Zerit was assessed in four main studies.
The first study compared the effects of Zerit taken alone with those of zidovudine (another antiviral medicine) in 822 HIV-infected patients who had been taking zidovudine for at least six months.
Its main measure of effectiveness was how long it took for the patients to develop a disease associated with AIDS or to die.
The second study compared two doses of Zerit in over 13,000 patients who did not respond to, or could not take, other types of antiviral medicine.
This study measured survival rates.
Two further studies assessed the effectiveness of Zerit, taken in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz (other antiviral medicines) in 467 treatment-naïve patients (who had not taken treatment for HIV infection before).
The main measures of effectiveness were the levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) and the number of CD4 T-cells in the blood (CD4 cell count) after 48 weeks of treatment.
CD4 T-cells are white blood cells that are important in helping to fight infections, but which are killed by HIV.
What benefit has Zerit shown during the studies?
The studies showed that Zerit could reduce the rates of disease progression in HIV-infected patients.
Patients taking Zerit alone developed an AIDS-related disease or died at a similar rate to those taking zidovudine.
Patients taking either of two doses of Zerit also had similar survival rates over 22 weeks.
When taken in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz, around 70% of the patients taking Zerit had viral loads below 400 copies/ ml after 48 weeks.
The patients ’ CD4 cell counts also rose from around 280 cells/ mm3 before treatment by an average of around 185 cells/ mm3.
What is the risk associated with Zerit?
The most common side effects when taking Zerit (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are peripheral neuropathy (damage to the nerves in the extremities causing tingling, numbness and pain in the hands and feet), diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal (tummy) pain, dyspepsia (heartburn), fatigue (tiredness), lipodystrophy (redistribution of body fat), dizziness, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), abnormal thinking, somnolence (sleepiness), depression, rash, pruritus (itching) and hyperlactataemia (elevated lactic acid levels in the blood).
For the full list of side effects reported with Zerit, see the Package Leaflet.
Zerit should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to stavudine or any of the other ingredients.
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Zerit may also be at risk of osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).
Patients who have problems with their liver (including hepatitis B or C infection) may be at an elevated risk of liver damage when taking Zerit.
As with all other NRTIs, Zerit may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Zerit during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
Why has Zerit been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that there was good evidence for Zerit’ s effectiveness when taken with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of HIV infection in adults.
It also concluded that there are positive data, albeit limited, supporting its effectiveness in HIV-infected children.
The Committee decided that Zerit’ s benefits are greater than its risks in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infected patients.
It recommended that Zerit be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Zerit:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Zerit to BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB PHARMA EEIG on 8 May 1996.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 8 May 2001 and 8 May 2006.
