Miscellaneous questions
Does & kde; support transparency and other visual effects provided by the new composite extension to X. org?
Yes! An exciting new feature in & kde; 3.4 and greater is support for the new X composite extension. This allows for effects such as translucency and drop shadows for all windows, easily configurable through & kwin; 's configuration dialog. This requires you to be using X. org version 6.8.0 or newer and have: Section "Extensions" Option "Composite" "Enable" EndSection In your xorg. conf. If you have an nvidia graphics card and use the nvidia driver you can improve the performance of these effects by also adding the RenderAccel option to the Device section for your graphics card: Section "Device" Identifier "nvidia-fx5200" Driver "nvidia" Option "RenderAccel" "true" Once you have configured X. org correctly, transparency and other effects can be enabled through the Desktop Window Behavior & kcontrolcenter; module, under the Translucency tab.
What about & kde; programs that do not have icons? How do I get them into the menu?
Use & kmenuedit;. To access it use the & RMB; on the K button and select Menu Editor.
Does & kde; have a graphical & FTP; client?
Yes, and it is none other than your favorite file manager, & konqueror;. You can drag and drop remote files into local folders.
How do I exit & kde;?
Simply click on the K button and select Logout. In addition, if you right click on an empty area of the desktop, you will be presented with a menu containing logout as one of the options.
Depending on your configuration of the & X-Window;, Ctrl; Alt; Backspace; might also do the trick by killing the X server, but its use prevents session management and cannot be recommended.
Is there a program that checks for new mails at my ISP if and only if I am online?
& korn; will do the job. If you are not connected, it will just sit there (idling).
Is it really necessary to upgrade to the latest version?
We recommend to always use the latest stable release. If you do n't, it will probably be difficult to get answers to your questions. If you have a problem with an old version, the answer will probably be Please upgrade and try again. Note that new versions also sometimes fix security problems.
How do I copy and paste in & kde;?
The simplest method is to use your mouse:
Highlight the text you want to copy by holding down the & LMB; and dragging across the text. This adds the selected text to the clipboard.
Go to the destination area; depending on your configuration, you might need to click it using the & LMB; to give it focus.
Click the & MMB; to paste. If you have a two button mouse and are emulating a three button mouse, push both buttons simultaneously.
For more information about using the clipboard in & kde; please see the & klipper; hand book, accessed by typing help: / klipper into the & konqueror; address bar.
How do I convert the default & RedHat; menus into a menu in the K menu?
Click on the K button and select System Appfinder.
What is SVN?
It stands for Subversion, and is a version control system. It is similar to CVS, but improves on it in many ways. It is used to maintain source code under development. It will keep multiple versions of things (handy if you broke something and have to back up and get a clean old version), and allows people remote access over the internet to pick up the latest source code and even to check in new files if they have permission. It is also open source (you pay for support if you want it), and since it is free it is the system of choice for people writing more free products, such as & kde;.
Does & kde; support dual screen (Xinerama)?
Yes, you need to have a multi-headed X server (eg; MetroX or XFree86 4.0 and above) and a & kde; > = 2.2.1
How do I check which version of & kde; I am using?
Fire up the & kcontrolcenter;. It comes up with an Info Screen including the version of & kde; The & kde; version is also included in the application's About dialog. You can also check from the command line with the command kde-config --version
How do I go about creating themes and icons?
Go see http: / /kde-artists. org. There is also a more informal community of & kde; related artists and artwork at http: / /kde-look. org.
How can I get to know about development updates?
You might want to subscribe to the various & kde; mailing lists available, especially kde-cvs, which lists all commits done to the & kde; CVS repository. Check http: / /lists. kde. org if you want to read without subscribing.
