Define Label Range

label ranges in sheets
Define Label Range
Opens a dialogue box in which you can define a label range.
The cell contents of a label range can be used like names in formulae - $[officename] recognises these names in the same manner that it does the predefined names of the weekdays and months.
These names are automatically completed when typed into a formula.
In addition, the names defined by label ranges will have priority over names defined by automatically generated ranges.
You can set label ranges that contain the same labels on different sheets. $[officename] first searches the label ranges of the current sheet and, following a failed search, the ranges of other sheets.
Range
Displays the cell reference of each label range.
In order to remove a label range from the list box, select it and then click
Delete
.
Contains column labels
Includes column labels in the current label range.
Contains row labels
Includes row labels in the current label range.
For data range
Sets the data range for which the selected label range is valid.
To modify it, click in the sheet and select another range with the mouse.
Add
Adds the current label range to the list.
