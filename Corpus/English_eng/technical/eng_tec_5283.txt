Variables
Next
Sometimes it is convenient to be able to have variable variable names.
That is, a variable name which can be set and used dynamically.
A normal variable is set with a statement such as:
?php $a = "hello";?
A variable variable takes the value of a variable and treats that as the name of a variable.
In the above example, hello, can be used as the name of a variable by using two dollar signs. i.e.
?php $$a = "world";?
At this point two variables have been defined and stored in the PHP symbol tree: $a with contents "hello" and $hello with contents "world ".
Therefore, this statement:
?php echo "$a ${$a}";?
produces the exact same output as:
?php echo "$a $hello";?
i.e. they both produce: hello world.
In order to use variable variables with arrays, you have to resolve an ambiguity problem.
That is, if you write $$a[ 1] then the parser needs to know if you meant to use $a[1] as a variable, or if you wanted $$a as the variable and then the [1] index from that variable.
The syntax for resolving this ambiguity is: ${$a[1]} for the first case and ${$a}[1] for the second.
Warning
Please note that variable variables cannot be used with PHP 's Superglobal arrays.
This means you cannot do things like ${$_GET}.
If you are looking for a way to handle availability of superglobals and the old HTTP_*_VARS, you might want to try referencing them.
