PHP Manual

(PHP 4 = 4.0.1)
yaz_search() prepares for a search on the connection given by id.
The type represents the query type - only "rpn" is supported now in which case the third argument specifies a Type-1 query in prefix query notation.
Like yaz_connect() this function is non-blocking and only prepares for a search to be executed later when yaz_wait() is called.
The RPN query is a textual represenation of the Type-1 query as defined by the Z39.50 standard.
However, in the text representation as used by YAZ a prefix notation is used, that is the operater precedes the operands.
The query string is a sequence of tokens where white space is ignored is ignored unless surrounded by double quotes.
Tokens beginning with an at-character (@) are considered operators, otherwise they are treated as search terms.
Table 1.
RPN Operators
Construct
Description
@and query1 query2
intersection of query1 and query2
@or query1 query2
union of query1 and query2
@not query1 query2
query1 and not query2
@set name
result set reference
@attrset set query
specifies attribute-set for query.
This construction is only allowed once - in the beginning of the whole query
@attr [set] type=value query
applies attribute to query.
The type and value are integers specifying the attribute-type and attribute-value respectively.
The set, if given, specifies the attribute-set.
Example 1.
Query Examples
You can search for simple terms, like this
computer
The Query
"knuth donald"
This query applies two attributes for the same phrase.
@attr 1=1003 @attr 4=1 "knuth donald"
This query
@and @or a b @not @or c d e
Another, more complex, one:
@attrset gils @and @attr 1=4 art @attr 1=2000 company
You can find information about attributes at the Z39.50 Maintenance Agency site.
Note:
If you would like to use a more friendly notation, use the CCL parser - functions yaz_ccl_conf() and yaz_ccl_parse().
