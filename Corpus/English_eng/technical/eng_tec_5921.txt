zonetab2pot. py

Converts a timezone list to a PO file template.
zonetab2pot. py timezone-list
Description
zonetab2pot. py reads the timezone list given on the command-line and converts it to a gettext message file (PO-file) template containing the names of the individual timezones.
The given timezone list should be in the same format as the system zone. tab. If no timezone list is specified on the command-line, / usr/ share/ zoneinfo/ zone. tab will be used.
The new PO-file template will be written to standard output.
This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.
