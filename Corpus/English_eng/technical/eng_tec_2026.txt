Page Numbers
In Writer, a page number is a field that you can insert into your text.
To Insert Page Numbers
Insert - Fields - Page Number
to insert a page number at the current cursor position.
View - Field names
.
However, these fields will change position when you add or remove text.
So it is best to insert the page number field into a header or footer that has the same position and that is repeated on every page.
Insert - Header - (name of page style)
or
Insert - Footer - (name of page style)
to add a header or footer to all pages with the current Page Style.
To Start With a Defined Page Number
Now you want some more control on page numbers.
You are writing a text document that should start with page number 12.
Click within the first paragraph of your document.
Format - Paragraph - Text flow
.
Insert
.
Enable
With Page Style
just to be able to set the new
Page number
.
Click
OK
.
The new page number is an attribute of the first paragraph of the page.
To Format the Page Number Style
You want roman page numbers running i, ii, iii, iv, and so on.
Edit Fields
dialogue box.
OK
.
Using Different Page Number Styles
You need some pages with the roman numbering style, followed by the remaining pages in another style.
In Writer, you will need different Page Styles.
The first Page Style has a footer with a page number field formatted for roman numbers.
The following Page Style has a footer with a page number field formatted in another look.
Both Page Styles must be separated by a page break.
In Writer, you can have automatic page breaks and manually inserted page breaks.
automatic page break
appears at the end of a page when the Page Style has a different &quot; next style &quot; .
Styles and Formatting
window, click the
Page Styles
icon, right-click the First Page entry.
Choose
Modify
from the context menu.
On the
Organiser
tab, you can see the &quot; next style &quot; .
manually inserted page break
can be applied without or with a change of page styles.
Ctrl+Enter
, you apply a page break without a change of styles.
Insert - Manual break
, you can insert a page break without or with a change of style or with a change of page number.
It depends on your document what is best: to use a manually inserted page break between Page Styles, or to use an automatic change.
If you just need one title page with a different style than the other pages, you can use the automatic method:
To Apply a Different Page Style to the First Page
Click within the first page of your document.
Format - Styles and Formatting
.
Styles and Formatting
window, click the
Page Styles
icon.
Double-click the &quot; First Page &quot; style.
Now your title page has the style &quot; First Page &quot; , and the next pages automatically have the &quot; Default &quot; style.
You can now for example insert a footer for the &quot; Default &quot; page style only, or insert footers in both page styles, but with differently formatted page number fields.
To Apply a Manually Inserted Page Style Change
Click at the start of the first paragraph on the page where a different Page Style will be applied.
Insert - Manual Break
.
You will see the
Insert Break
dialogue box.
Style
list box, select a Page Style.
You may set a new page number, too.
Click
OK
.
The selected page style will be used from the current paragraph to the next page break with style.
You may need to create the new Page Style first.
