(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a positive MySQL result resource to the query result, or FALSE on error.
The function also returns TRUE / FALSE for INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE queries to indicate success / failure.
mysql_db_query() selects a database and executes a query on it.
If the optional link identifier isn' t specified, the function will try to find an open link to the MySQL server and if no such link is found it'll try to create one as if mysql_connect() was called with no arguments.
Be aware that this function does NOT switch back to the database you were connected before.
In other words, you can 't use this function to temporarily run a sql query on another database, you would have to manually switch back.
Users are strongly encouraged to use the database.table syntax in their sql queries instead of this function.
See also mysql_connect() and mysql_query().
Note:
This function has been deprecated since PHP 4.0.6.
Do not use this function.
Use mysql_select_db() and mysql_query() instead.
