Configuration
Customization
The & kcontrolcenter;
The & kcontrolcenter;
The & kcontrolcenter; is the place to go to change any settings that affect the whole of your & kde; environment. You can open it using the Control Center item in the & kmenu;, or with its command-line name, kcontrol.
The settings are divided into several major categories, which each contain several pages of settings. To display a settings page, expand the major category by clicking on the + button next to it, and then click on the name of the page you want. The settings page then appears on the right, and you can change settings to your heart's content. No changes take effect until you click on the Apply button. If you decide, after making some changes, that you want to leave the settings as they were, just click on Reset.
If you need more help with a page, visit that page, then click on the Help tab. You might also want to look at the & kcontrolcenter; Handbook, which you can open with the Help kcontrolcenter; Handbook.

Security & Privacy
This section is where you can configure options related to security and privacy such as the use of cryptography, enabling the KDE wallet, setting your identity and managing caches.
Crypto
This module allows you to configure SSl for use with most KDE applications, as well as manage your personal certificates and the known certificate authorities.
KDE Wallet
Here you can change your KDE Wallet Manager settings.
KDE Wallet aims to provide secure storage for passwords and web form data. You can group different passwords in different wallets, and each one will only be opened with a master password (which you should never forget!). The default wallet is named "kdewallet", and you can either create a new wallet for your local passwords or accept the default wallet for all data in the "Automatic Wallet Selection" section.
KDE programs like Konqueror, Kmail and Kopete are fully compatible with the KDE Wallet Manager. All of them will ask at least once for permission to access to actual wallet. You can give different access levels, such as "always allow", "allow once", etc. If you want to change that access level, you can do it from the "Access Control" tab by deleting the program entry and selecting a new preference the next time that application requests access to the wallet.
Wallet Preferences
To enable the KDE wallet subsystem, check the Enable the KDE wallet subsystem box. Unchecking this box will disable the KDE Wallet on your system.
By default, KDE Wallet Manager is kept opened until the user session is closed, but you can change that in the Close Wallet section to close it when unused for a time, when a screen saver starts or when the last application stops using it.
As you can have several wallets, Automatic Wallet Selection allows you start KDE with a given wallet.
KDE Wallet will appear in your system tray by default, but you can hide it. Uncheck Show manager in the system tray to keep it always hidden, or check Hide system tray icon when last wallet closes to hide it only when all wallets are closed. These items are in the Wallet Manager section.
Access Control
You can set here what policy you want for your KDE applications, regarding to the wallet use.
Password & User Account
You can change here your personal information which will be used in mail programs and word processors. You can change your login password by clicking the Change Password... button.
Privacy
This module allows you to erase traces which KDE leaves on your system such as command histories or browser caches.
System Administration
This module allows you to configure aspects of your system such as the bootloader, the kernel and helps you perform essential system tasks. Most of these sections will require the root or Administrator password to effect changes.
Boot Manager (LILO)
If you use the popular bootloader LILO this section will allow you to configure it. You can configure the location to install the bootloader to, set the timeout on the LILO boot screen as well as add or modify kernel images for the boot list.
Date & Time
This configuration module allows you to configure the system date and time settings. You can set the date, time, and also the current time zone. These settings will be applied system-wide.
Font Installer

IBM Thinkpad Laptop
This configuration module allows you to configure the special keys on an IBM thinkpad laptop. You will need the nvram module to use these features.
Linux Kernel
If you run & kde; on & Linux; there is a & kcontrol; module to create or modify configuration files for a & Linux; kernel. This configurator is compatible with kernels previous to 2.5.
Login Manager
This module allows you to configure the & kde; login manager, & kdm;. & kdm; is a powerful login manager with a large range of options. It supports user switching, remote graphical logins and has a fully customizable appearance. For more information, see the & kdm; handbook.
Paths
This dialog allows you to configure the default locations where certain important files are kept. The Desktop directory contains all the files on your desktop. The Autostart directory contains files or links to files that you want run when & kde; starts, and the Documents directory is the default location & kde; applications will open or save documents to.
Sony Vaio Laptop
This configuration module allows you to configure features specific to Sony Vaio laptops. If you have a Sony Vaio, you will have to install the sonypi driver to use this section.
