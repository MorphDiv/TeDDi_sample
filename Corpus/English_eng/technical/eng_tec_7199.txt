How to use flags
Flags are used to mark tiles which you suspect may hide a mine. Putting a flag on a tile prevents you from clicking on it and possibly causing an explosion, which would end the game.
How to place a flag on a tile
Red flags are those that cannot be clicked. To place a red flag on a tile:
right click on a blank tile.
To make the number of available flags equal to the number of remaining mines, enable

Start by chosing one of the three default board sizes, or by selecting a custom board.
The game begins with the board covered in tiles. Click on any tile to uncover it. You will reveal:
A colored number, which represent the number of mines in the adjacent tiles. This will help you deduce where the mines are so that you can mark them with
A blank tile, which means there are no mines under any of the adjacent tiles.
A mine, which will detonate and end the game.
Repeat the previous step until you have uncovered all the tiles which do not have mines underneath them.
If you complete the game quickly enough, you will be added to the
