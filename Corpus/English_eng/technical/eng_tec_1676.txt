Static statement
Static Statement [Run-time]
Declares a variable or an array at the procedure level within a subroutine or a function, so that the values of the variable or the array are retained after exiting the subroutine or function.
Dim statement conventions are also valid.
Static statement
cannot be used to define variable arrays.
Arrays must be specified as a fixed size.
Syntax:
Static VarName[(start To end)] [As VarType], VarName2[(start To end)] [As VarType], ...
Example:
Sub ExampleStatic
Dim iCount as Integer, iResult as Integer
For iCount = 0 to 2
iResult = InitVar()
Next iCount
MsgBox iResult,0, &quot; The answer is &quot;
End Sub
REM Function for initialisation of the static variable
Function InitVar() As Integer
Static iInit As Integer
Const iMinimum as Integer = 40 REM minimum return value of this function
if iInit = 0 then REM check if initialised
iInit = iMinimum
else
iInit = iInit + 1
end if
InitVar = iInit
End Function
