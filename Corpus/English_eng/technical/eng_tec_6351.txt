Window-Specific Settings Configuration Module
(c) 2004 KWin and KControl Authors

Window-specific Settings Here you can customize window settings specifically only for some windows. Please note that this configuration will not take effect if you do not use KWin as your window manager. If you do use a different window manager, please refer to its documentation for how to customize window behavior.
Remember settings separately for every window

Information About Selected Window

Machine:
For selecting all windows belonging to a specific application, selecting only window class should usually work.
Use window & class (whole application)
For selecting a specific window in an application, both window class and window role should be selected. Window class will determine the application, and window role the specific window in the application; many applications do not provide useful window roles though.
Use window class and window & role (specific window)
With some (non-KDE) applications whole window class can be sufficient for selecting a specific window in an application, as they set whole window class to contain both application and window role.
Use & whole window class (specific window)
Match also window & title
A single shortcut can be easily assigned or cleared using the two buttons. Only shortcuts with modifiers can be used. It is possible to have several possible shortcuts, and the first available shortcut will be used. The shortcuts are specified using space-separated shortcut sets. One set is specified as base+(list), where base are modifiers and list is a list of keys. For example "Shift+Alt+(123) Shift+Ctrl+(ABC)" will first try Shift+Alt+1, then others with Shift+Ctrl+C as the last one.

Enable this checkbox to alter this window property for the specified window(s).
Specify how the window property should be affected: Do Not Affect: The window property will not be affected and therefore the default handling for it will be used. Specifying this will block more generic window settings from taking effect. Apply Initially: The window property will be only set to the given value after the window is created. No further changes will be affected. Remember: The value of the window property will be remembered and every time time the window is created, the last remembered value will be applied. Force: The window property will be always forced to the given value. Apply Now: The window property will be set to the given value immediately and will not be affected later (this action will be deleted afterwards). Force temporarily: The window property will be forced to the given value until it is hidden (this action will be deleted after the window is hidden).

Unnamed entry
You have specified the window class as unimportant. This means the settings will possibly apply to windows from all applications. If you really want to create a generic setting, it is recommended you at least limit the window types to avoid special window types.
Edit Window-Specific Settings
This configuration dialog allows altering settings only for the selected window or application. Find the setting you want to affect, enable the setting using the checkbox, select in what way the setting should be affected and to which value.
Consult the documentation for more details.
