Introduction
What's & amor;?
& amor; is an acronym which stands for Amusing Misuse of Resources. It is actually an animation which sits on top of your active window. In its default configuration, & amor; takes the form of a yellow spot which performs many tricks. & amor; also has many different themes which change the appearance and behavior of the animation.
Since & amor; works with the & kde; window manager & kwin;, the application will only work from within & kde;. It is possible that & amor; would work from within another & kde; -compliant window manager, but none are known to work at the time of this writing.
Configuration
Configuring & amor;
To configure & amor;, click on the animation using your & RMB;. A menu will appear containing three items: Options..., About..., and Quit. Choose Options... to configure & amor;
General Options
The following settings for & amor; can be changed from the Options dialog:
Theme
This determines the appearance and behavior of & amor;. Themes are described in the next section.
Offset
This slider controls where the animation appears in relation to the top of the active window. The default middle setting will place the animation right above the window title bar, whereas setting the slider all the way to the top or bottom will result in the animation appearing a fair distance above or below the title bar, respectively.
Setting this slider to a lower setting will allow the animation to be visible even when the active window is maximized.
Always on top
Checking this option will cause the animation to always appear in front of any existing windows on the screen, including the panel.
Show random tips
If checked, the animation will display various & kde; -related tips at random intervals.
Allow application tips
Any & kde; application can be designed to display helpful tips via & amor;. If this option is checked, and an appropriate application is the active window, the animation will display tips for that application.
At the time of this writing, no & kde; applications make use of this functionality.
& amor; Themes
& amor; comes with many built-in themes, which change the appearance and behavior of the animation. In addition, it is possible to create new & amor; themes. The built-in themes for & amor; are described in the table below
