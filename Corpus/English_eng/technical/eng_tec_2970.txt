ftp_nb_get() retrieves remote_file from the FTP server, and saves it to local_file locally.
The transfer mode specified must be either FTP_ASCII or FTP_BINARY.
The difference between this function and the ftp_get() is that this function retrieves the file asynchronously, so your program can perform other operations while the file is being downloaded.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
Example 1. ftp_nb_get() example
/ / Initate the download $ret = ftp_nb_get( $my_connection, "test", "README", FTP_BINARY); while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {/ / Do whatever you want echo "."; / / Continue downloading... $ret = ftp_nb_continue ($my_connection);} if ($ret != FTP_FINISHED) {echo "There was an error downloading the file.. ."; exit(1);}
Example 2.
Resuming a download with ftp_nb_get()
/ / Initate $ret = ftp_nb_get ($my_connection, "test", "README", FTP_BINARY, filesize("test")); / / OR: $ret = ftp_nb_get ($my_connection, "test", "README", / / FTP_BINARY, FTP_AUTORESUME); while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {/ / Do whatever you want echo "."; / / Continue downloading... $ret = ftp_nb_continue ($my_connection);} if ($ret != FTP_FINISHED) {echo "There was an error downloading the file.. ."; exit(1);}
Example 3.
Resuming a download at position 100 to a new file with ftp_nb_get()
/ / Disable Autoseek ftp_set_option ($my_connection, FTP_AUTOSEEK, FALSE); / / Initiate $ret = ftp_nb_get ($my_connection, "newfile", "README", FTP_BINARY, 100); while ($ret == FTP_MOREDATA) {... / / Continue downloading... $ret = ftp_nb_continue ($my_connection);}
In the example above, "newfile" is 100 bytes smaller than "README "on the FTP server because we started reading at offset 100.
If we have not have disabled FTP_AUTOSEEK, the first 100 bytes of newfile will be '\0'.
