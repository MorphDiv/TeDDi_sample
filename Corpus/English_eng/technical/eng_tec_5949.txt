Webbrowsing with & konqueror;
& konqueror; is & kde; 's open source, standards compliant webbrowser. It's home page is http: / /www. konqueror. org where a & konqueror; specific FAQ can be found.
Where does the name & konqueror; come from?
It's a word play on the other browsers' names. After the Navigator and the Explorer comes the Conqueror; it's spelled with a K to show that it's part of & kde;. The name change also moves away from kfm (the & kde; file manager, & konqueror; 's predecessor) which represented only file management.
Can I run & konqueror; without running & kde;?
Yes. Just install & Qt;, kdelibs and kdebase, and from your favorite window manager just launch & konqueror;. It should work just fine, but if it does n't (kde; developers do n't test that case often), report it to http: / /bugs. kde. org and try running "kdeinit" before running & konqueror;, it usually helps. This is of course the same for any other & kde; application.
Why does n't & konqueror; show the contents of an image's ALT attribute in a tooltip?
There is no standard that states the ALT attribute should appear as a tooltip. The specification calls for ALT to be displayed in place of the image, as in text-mode only browsers such at lynx or w3m. Abusing the ALT attribute is bad for accessibility. Tooltips are supposed to come from the TITLE attribute and this is implemented in & konqueror;
How do I use & konqueror; as a web browser with a proxy?
& konqueror; can be used with & HTTP; and & FTP; proxies. To set up the proxy server in & konqueror;, just select Settings Configure & konqueror;... from the & konqueror; menu and go to the Proxy tab.
How do I import bookmarks from another browser into & konqueror;?
To import bookmarks from another browser into & konqueror; select Bookmarks Edit Bookmarks and then in the Bookmark Editor select File Import. Then select the browser you would like to import bookmarks from. In the Open dialog, navigate to the location of the folder or file your bookmarks are contained in and click Open
How can I make & konqueror; only show certain bookmarks in the bookmarks toolbar?
In & konqueror; go to Settings Configure & konqueror;.... Then select Web Behaviour from the icon list. Under the Bookmarks heading, place a check in the box next to Show only marked bookmarks in bookmark toolbar. Now in the Bookmark Editor an option to Show in Toolbar appears on clicking with the & RMB; on any bookmark entry or in the Edit menu when the entry is highlighted. Folders can also be shown in the bookmarks toolbar in much the same way.
How do I fool a site into believing & konqueror; is & Netscape; or some other browser?
In & konqueror;, select Settings Configure Konqueror... and in the configuration dialog, select Browser Identification. Default and site-specific browser identifications can be set from here.
& konqueror; is taking a really long time to load webpages, what could cause this?
Quite often & konqueror; loading webpages slowly is caused by DNS servers with broken IPV6 support. Adding the following to / etc/ profile or any other script that is sourced on login should solve this problem: export KDE_NO_IPV6=true for bourne compatible shells, and for C-style shells:
setenv KDE_NO_IPV6 true
How do I configure & konqueror; to run & Java; applets?
Choose Settings Configure & konqueror;... from & konqueror; 's menubar and then select Java & Javascript. Set the Path to Java executable correctly. If it does n't work, please check the Konqueror + Java HOWTO.
How do I block unrequested popup windows in & konqueror;?
& konqueror; has a new'smart 'policy for JavaScript popups. From the & konqueror; main window, select Settings Configure & konqueror;... and then Java & JavaScript. On the JavaScript tab, under Global JavaScript Policies set the radio button beside Open new windows: to Smart.
Why does n't my banking site work with & konqueror;? It pops up a new window with the login screen in other browsers, but not in & konqueror;.
Make sure you have Javascript enabled, and the default JavaScript web popups policy set to Ask or Allow. The Smart policy is not always sufficient for some banks. Many banks also require & Java; support. You can find more help on enabling this at http: / /www. konqueror. org/.
Can & konqueror; use user-specified stylesheets, like those in the Firefox adblock extention?
Yes, you can set & konqueror; to use any kind of valid css stylesheet to filter webcontent or improve accessibility. From the & konqueror; main window simply click Settings Configure & konqueror;... and select Stylesheets. Set the radio button to Use user-defined stylesheet and browse to where the stylesheet you want to use is located. Alternatively, you can select Use accessibility stylesheet defined in "Customize" tab and then set your own options.
An example of css rules that implement ad blocking can be found at: http: / /www. mozilla. org/ support/ firefox/ adblock.
Why does & konqueror; display a plain grey square when I try to view flash animations, even though the flash plugin is installed?
Under the latest versions of X. org, having the composite extension loaded can cause problems with the flash plugin. Try disabling the composite extension and see if normal flash operation is restored.
Why ca n't & konqueror; render & GIF; images?
It is because you did not enable & GIF; support in & Qt;. Please see for more details.
When I try to open a web page with & konqueror;, I get the message: There appears to be a configuration error. You have associated Konqueror with text/ html, but it cannot handle this file type.
You need to make sure that the embedding settings for the text/ html MIME type are correct:
In & konqueror;, go to Settings Configure & konqueror;... and then to the File Associations page.
Open text- > html in the tree view.
Click on the Embedding tab. Make sure that Left Click Action is set to Show file in embedded viewer, and that KHTML (khtml) is at the top of Services Preference Order.
