ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
This documentation describes & kde; 's control center.
KDE
kcontrol
configuration
settings
module
The & kcontrolcenter; (from now on referred to simply as the control center) provides you with a centralized and convenient way to configure all of your & kde; settings.
The control center is made up of multiple modules. Each module is a separate application, but the control center organizes all of these programs into a convenient location.
Each control center module can be executed individually
See section entitled Running individual control center modules for more information.
The control center groups the configuration modules into categories, so they are easy to locate. Within each category, the control center shows all the modules in a list, so it is easier to find the right configuration module.
Using the & kcontrolcenter;
This next section details the use of the control center itself. For information on individual modules, please see Control Center Modules
Starting the & kcontrol;
The & kcontrolcenter; can be started in 3 ways:
By selecting K Button Control Center from the & kde; Panel.
By pressing Alt; F2.
This will bring up a dialog box. Type kcontrol, and click Run.
You can type kcontrol & at any command prompt.
All three of these methods are equivalent, and produce the same result.
The & kcontrolcenter; Screen
When you start the control center, you are presented with a window, which can be divided into 3 functional parts.

The & kde; Control Center Screen
Across the top is a menubar. The menubar will provide you with quick access to most of & kcontrolcenter; 's features. The menus are detailed in The & kde; Control Center Menus.
Along the left hand side, is a icon tree. Here you can choose which module to configure.
The main panel shows you some system information.
In this example, we are running & kde; 3.4.0, we started & kcontrolcenter; as user newkde, the computer is named turtle, it is a & Linux; system running the 2.6 kernel, on a i686 processor.
The & kcontrolcenter; Menus
This next section gives you a brief description of what each menu item does.
File Menu
The File menu has a single entry.
Ctrl; Q File Quit
Closes the control center.
View Menu
These options determine how the module selection looks and behaves.
View Mode
Determines whether to use Tree view, or Icon view for your modules.
With Tree view, each submenu appears as an indented list.
With Icon view, when you click on a category, the categories disappear and are replaced with the module list. You then use the Back button to return to the categories.
View Icon size
Using this option, you can choose Small, Medium, or Large icons to select your modules.
This menu item only controls the icon size if you are in Icon View. If you choose Tree View, the Small icon size will be used, no matter what size was previously selected in Icon View.
Settings Menu
The Settings menu has a single entry, Settings Configure Shortcuts.... From here you can map keyboard shortcuts to the other menu options.
Help Menu
& help. menu. documentation;
Exiting The & kde; Control Center
You can exit the control center one of three ways:
Select File Quit from the menu bar.
Type Ctrl; Q on the keyboard.
Click on the Close button on the frame surrounding the control center.
Running Individual Modules
You can run individual modules without running kcontrol using the command kcmshell4 from & konsole;. Type kcmshell4 --list to see a list of the available & kcontrolcenter; modules. You can also access individual & kcontrolcenter; modules through adding the Preferences button to either & kicker; or the & kmenu; through their respective configuration dialogs.
The & kcontrolcenter; Modules
In order to make it as easy as possible, the & kcontrolcenter; has organized similar options into groups. Each group is called a module. When you click on the name of a module in the left window, you will be presented with the options of the module on the right.
Each module will have some or all of the following buttons:
Help
This button will give you help specific to the current module. The button will show you a short summary help page in the left window. At the bottom of that window, you can click on a link to get more detailed help.
Defaults
This button will restore this module to its default values. You must click OK to save the options.
Apply
Clicking this button will save all changes to & kde;. If you have changed anything, clicking Apply will cause the changes to take effect.
Reset
This button will Reset the module to the previous settings.
You must save the options of the current module using Apply before you can change to a different module.
If you try to change without saving your options, you will be asked if you want to save your changes, or discard them.
