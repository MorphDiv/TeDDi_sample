Could not initiate attachment compression.
Could not compress the attachment.
unknown%1
"%1" not found. Please specify the full path.
You may not attach files bigger than %1.
The MIME type of the file: Normally, you do not need to touch this setting, since the type of the file is automatically checked; but, sometimes, %1 may not detect the type correctly -- here is where you can fix that.
The estimated size of the attachment: Note that, in an email message, a binary file encoded with base64 will take up four thirds the actual size of the file.
The file name of the part: Although this defaults to the name of the attached file, it does not specify the file to be attached; rather, it suggests a file name to be used by the recipient's mail agent when saving the part to disk.
A description of the part: This is just an informational description of the part, much like the Subject is for the whole message; most mail agents will show this information in their message previews alongside the attachment's icon.
The transport encoding of this part: Normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.
Check this option if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this part in the message preview, instead of the default icon view; Technically, this is carried out by setting this part's Content-Disposition header field to "inline" instead of the default "attachment".
Check this option if you want this message part to be signed. The signature will be made with the key that you associated with the currently-selected identity.
Check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted. The part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message.
