ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Oprymea 0.088 mg tablets
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each tablet contains 0.088 mg pramipexole base (as 0.125 mg pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate).
Please note:
Pramipexole doses as published in the literature refer to the salt form.
Therefore, doses will be expressed in terms of both pramipexole base and pramipexole salt (in brackets).
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Tablet.
0.088 mg: white, round, with bevelled edges and imprint "P6" on one side of the tablet.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Oprymea is indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i. e. over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or “ on off” fluctuations).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Parkinson’ s disease The tablets should be taken orally, swallowed with water, and can be taken either with or without food.
The daily dosage is administered in equally divided doses 3 times a day.
Initial treatment Dosages should be increased gradually from a starting-dose of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day and then increased every 5 - 7 days.
Providing patients do not experience intolerable side-effects, the dosage should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.
Ascending – Dose Schedule of OPRYMEA Week

Total Daily Dose (mg of salt)
1 2 3
3 x 0.088 3 x 0.18 3 x 0.35
0.264 0.54 1.1
3 x 0.125 3 x 0.25 3 x 0.5
0.375 0.75 1.50
If a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.54 mg base (0.75 mg salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
2 However, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.8).
Maintenance treatment The individual dose should be in the range of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a maximum of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
During dose escalation in three pivotal studies, efficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt).
Further dose adjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions.
In clinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt).
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, doses higher than 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt) per day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended.
It is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the maintenance treatment with Oprymea, depending on reactions in individual patients.
Treatment discontinuation Abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Therefore, pramipexole should be tapered off at a rate of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt).
Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.4).
Dosing in patients with renal impairment The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function.
The following dosage schedule is suggested for initiation of therapy:
Patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/ min require no reduction in daily dose.
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/ min, the initial daily dose of Oprymea should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/ 0.25 mg of salt daily).
In patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/ min, the daily dose of Oprymea should be administered in a single dose, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) daily.
If renal function declines during maintenance therapy reduce Oprymea daily dose by the same percentage as the decline in creatinine clearance, i. e. if creatinine clearance declines by 30%, then reduce the Oprymea daily dose by 30%.
The daily dose can be administered in two divided doses if creatinine clearance is between 20 and 50 ml/ min, and as a single daily dose if creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/ min.
Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx.
90% of absorbed active substance is excreted through the kidneys.
However, the potential influence of hepatic insufficiency on Oprymea pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.
Dosing in children and adolescents Oprymea is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
3 When prescribing Oprymea in a patient with Parkinson’ s disease with renal impairment a reduced dose is suggested in line with section 4.2.
Hallucinations are known as a side-effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa.
Patients should be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesias can occur during the initial titration of Oprymea.
If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.
Pramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson’ s disease.
Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly.
Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Oprymea.
Patients who have experienced somnolence and/ or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines.
Furthermore a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medication or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see section 4.7 and section 4.8).
Pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality have been reported in patients treated with dopamine agonists for Parkinson’ s disease, including pramipexole.
Furthermore, patients and caregivers should be aware of the fact that behavioural changes can occur.
Dose reduction/ taper or discontinuation should be considered.
Patients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.5).
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.
In case of severe cardiovascular disease, care shou ld be taken.
It is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy.
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2)
Reports in the literature indicate that treatment of another indication with dopaminergic medicinal products can result in augmentation.
Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities.
The frequency of augmentation after longer use of pramipexole and the appropriate management of these events have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is seen in man.
Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or elimination by biotransformation are unlikely.
As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with anticholinergics has not been investigated.
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and levodopa.
Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules.
Therefore, medicinal products
4 that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as cimetidine and amantadine, may interact with pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of either or both medicinal products.
Reduction of the pramipexole dose should be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly.
When Oprymea is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced and the dosage of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing the dose of Oprymea.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.4), e. g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans.
Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).
Oprymea should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i. e. if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
As pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected.
The excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women.
In rats, the concentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma.
In the absence of human data, Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding.
However, if its use is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Oprymea can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Hallucinations or somnolence can occur.
Patients being treated with Oprymea and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions are expected under the use of Oprymea: abnormal dreams, confusion, constipation, delusion, dizziness, dyskinesia, fatigue, hallucinations, headache, hyperkinesia, hypotension, increased eating (binge eating, hyperphagia), insomnia, libido disorders, nausea, peripheral oedema, paranoia, pathological gambling, hypersexuality and other abnormal behaviour; somnolence, weight increase, sudden onset of sleep; pruritus and rash and other hypersensitivity.
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,923 patients on pramipexole and 1,354 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently reported for both groups.
63% of patients on pramipexole and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse drug reaction.
The most commonly (≥ reported adverse reactions in patients with Parkinson’ s disease more 5%) frequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue.
The incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.2).
More frequent adverse drug
5 reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia.
Hypotension may occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.
The most commonly (≥
5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with other indication treated
with pramipexole were nausea, headache, dizziness and fatigue.
Nausea and fatigue were more often reported in female patients (20.8% and 10.5%, respectively) compared to males (6.7% and 7.3%, respectively).
Tables 1 and 2 display the frequency of adverse reactions from placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The adverse reactions reported in these tables are those events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with pramipexole and were reported significantly more often in patients taking pramipexole than placebo, or where the event was considered clinically relevant.
However, the majority of common adverse reactions were mild to moderate, they usually start early in therapy, and most tended to disappear even as therapy was continued.

Pramipexole is associated with somnolence (8.6%) and has been associated uncommonly with excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (0.1%).
See also section 4.4.
Pramipexole may be associated with libido disorders (increased (0.1%) or decreased (0.4%)).
Patients treated with dopamine agonists for Parkinson’ s disease, including pramipexole, especially at high doses, have been reported as exhibiting signs of pathological gambling, increase libido and hypersexuality, generally reversible upon treatment discontinuation.
4.9 Overdose
There is no clinical experience with massive overdose.
The expected adverse events would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension.
There is no established antidote for overdose 6 of a dopamine agonist.
If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent may be indicated.
Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of activated charcoal and electrocardiogram monitoring.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: dopamine agonists, ATC code:
N04BC05.
Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D 3 receptors, and has full intrinsic activity.
Pramipexole alleviates Parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the striatum.
Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and turnover.
In human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed.
Clinical trials in Parkinson’ s disease
In patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson 's disease.
Controlled clinical trials included approximately 2100 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I – IV.
Out of these, approximately 900 were in more advanced stages, received concomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications.
In early and advanced Parkinson’ s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in the controlled clinical trials was maintained for approximately six months.
In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years there were no signs of decreasing efficacy.
In a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole significantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to initial treatment with levodopa.
This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be balanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean change in UPDRS-score).
The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally higher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group.
However there was no significant difference during the maintenance phase.
These points should be considered when initiating pramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson´s disease.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Pramipexole is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration.
The absolute bioavailability is greater than 90% and the maximum plasma concentrations occur between 1 and 3 hours.
Concomitant administration with food did not reduce the extent of pramipexole absorption, but the rate of absorption was reduced.
Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient variation of plasma levels.
In humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is large (400 l).
High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx.
8-fold compared to plasma).
Pramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent.
Renal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination.
Approximately 90% of 14 C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces.
The total clearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/ min and the renal clearance is approximately 400 ml/ min.
The elimination half-life (t½) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.
7 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving the CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole.
Decreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the mini pig, and a tendency to an hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey.
The potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and rabbits.
Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternally toxic doses.
Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, the adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated.
Pramipexole was not genotoxic.
In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell hyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole.
This finding is not clinically relevant to man.
The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/ kg (of salt) and higher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats.
The latter finding was not observed in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species investigated.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Oprymea is indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i. e. over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or “ on off” fluctuations).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Parkinson’ s disease The tablets should be taken orally, swallowed with water, and can be taken either with or without food.
The daily dosage is administered in equally divided doses 3 times a day.
Initial treatment Dosages should be increased gradually from a starting-dose of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day and then increased every 5 - 7 days.
Providing patients do not experience intolerable side-effects, the dosage should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.

If a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.54 mg base (0.75 mg salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
10 However, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.8).
Maintenance treatment The individual dose should be in the range of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a maximum of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
During dose escalation in three pivotal studies, efficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt).
Further dose adjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions.
In clinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt).
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, doses higher than 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt) per day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended.
It is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the maintenance treatment with Oprymea, depending on reactions in individual patients.
Treatment discontinuation Abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Therefore, pramipexole should be tapered off at a rate of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt).
Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.4).
Dosing in patients with renal impairment The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function.
The following dosage schedule is suggested for initiation of therapy:
Patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/ min require no reduction in daily dose.
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/ min, the initial daily dose of Oprymea should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/ 0.25 mg of salt daily).
In patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/ min, the daily dose of Oprymea shou ld be administered in a single dose, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) daily.
If renal function declines during maintenance therapy reduce Oprymea daily dose by the same percentage as the decline in creatinine clearance, i. e. if creatinine clearance declines by 30%, then reduce the Oprymea daily dose by 30%.
The daily dose can be administered in two divided doses if creatinine clearance is between 20 and 50 ml/ min, and as a single daily dose if creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/ min.
Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx.
90% of absorbed active substance is excreted through the kidneys.
However, the potential influence of hepatic insufficiency on Oprymea pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.
Dosing in children and adolescents Oprymea is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
11 When prescribing Oprymea in a patient with Parkinson’ s disease with renal impairment a reduced dose is suggested in line with section 4.2.
Hallucinations are known as a side-effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa.
Patients should be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesias can occur during the initial titration of Oprymea.
If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.
Pramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson’ s disease.
Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly.
Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Oprymea.
Patients who have experienced somnolence and/ or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines.
Furthermore a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medication or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see section 4.7 and section 4.8).
Pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality have been reported in patients treated with dopamine agonists for Parkinson’ s disease, including pramipexole.
Furthermore, patients and caregivers should be aware of the fact that behavioural changes can occur.
Dose reduction/ taper or discontinuation should be considered.
Patients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.5).
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.
In case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken.
It is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy.
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2)
Reports in the literature indicate that treatment of another indication with dopaminergic medicinal products can result in augmentation.
Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities.
The frequency of augmentation after longer use of pramipexole and the appropriate management of these events have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is seen in man.
Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or elimination by biotransformation are unlikely.
As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with anticholinergics has not been investigated.
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and levodopa.
Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules.
Therefore, medicinal products
12 that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as cimetidine and amantadine, may interact with pramipex ole resulting in reduced clearance of either or both medicinal products.
Reduction of the pramipexole dose should be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly.
When Oprymea is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced and the dosage of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing the dose of Oprymea.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.4), e. g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans.
Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).
Oprymea should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i. e. if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
As pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected.
The excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women.
In rats, the concentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma.
In the absence of human data, Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding.
However, if its use is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Oprymea can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Hallucinations or somnolence can occur.
Patients being treated with Oprymea and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions are expected under the use of Oprymea: abnormal dreams, confusion, constipation, delusion, dizziness, dyskinesia, fatigue, hallucinations, headache, hyperkinesia, hypotension, increased eating (binge eating, hyperphagia), insomnia, libido disorders, nausea, peripheral oedema, paranoia, pathological gambling, hypersexuality and other abnormal behaviour; somnolence, weight increase, sudden onset of sleep; pruritus and rash and other hypersensitivity.
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,923 patients on pramipexole and 1,354 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently reported for both groups.
63% of patients on pramipexole and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse drug reaction.
The most commonly (≥ reported adverse reactions in patients with Parkinson’ s disease more 5%) frequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue.
The incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.2).
More frequent adverse drug
13 reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia.
Hypotension may occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.
The most commonly (≥
5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with other indication treated
with pramipexole were nausea, headache, dizziness and fatigue.
Nausea and fatigue were more often reported in female patients (20.8% and 10.5%, respectively) compared to males (6.7% and 7.3%, respectively).
Tables 1 and 2 display the frequency of adverse reactions from placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The adverse reactions reported in these tables are those events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with pramipexole and were reported significantly more often in patients taking pramipexole than placebo, or where the event was considered clinically relevant.
However, the majority of common adverse reactions were mild to moderate, they usually start early in therapy, and most tended to disappear even as therapy was continued.

Pramipexole is associated with somnolence (8.6%) and has been associated uncommonly with excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (0.1%).
See also section 4.4.
Pramipexole may be associated with libido disorders (increased (0.1%) or decreased (0.4%)).
Patients treated with dopamine agonists for Parkinson’ s disease, including pramipexole, especially at high doses, have been reported as exhibiting signs of pathological gambling, increase libido and hypersexuality, generally reversible upon treatment discontinuation.
4.9 Overdose
There is no clinical experience with massive overdose.
The expected adverse events would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension.
There is no established antidote for overdose 14 of a dopamine agonist.
If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent may be indicated.
Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of activated charcoal and electrocardiogram monitoring.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: dopamine agonists, ATC code:
N04BC05.
Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D 2 subfamily of dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D 3 receptors, and has full intrinsic activity.
Pramipexole alleviates Parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the striatum.
Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and turnover.
In human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed.
Clinical trials in Parkinson’ s disease
In patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson 's disease.
Controlled clinical trials included approximately 2100 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I – IV.
Out of these, approximately 900 were in more advanced stages, received concomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications.
In early and advanced Parkinson’ s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in the controlled clinical trials was maintained for approximately six months.
In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years there were no signs of decreasing efficacy.
In a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole significantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to initial treatment with levodopa.
This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be balanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean change in UPDRS-score).
The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally higher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group.
However there was no significant difference during the maintenance phase.
These points should be considered when initiating pramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson´s disease.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Pramipexole is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration.
The absolute bioavailability is greater than 90% and the maximum plasma concentrations occur between 1 and 3 hours.
Concomitant administration with food did not reduce the extent of pramipexole absorption, but the rate of absorption was reduced.
Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient variation of plasma levels.
In humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is large (400 l).
High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx.
8-fold compared to plasma).
Pramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent.
Renal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination.
Approximately 90% of 14 C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces.
The total clearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/ min and the renal clearance is approximat ely 400 ml/ min.
The elimination half-life (t½) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.
15 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving the CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole.
Decreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the mini pig, and a tendency to an hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey.
The potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and rabbits.
Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternally toxic doses.
Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, the adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated.
Pramipexole was not genotoxic.
In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell hyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole.
This finding is not clinically relevant to man.
The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/ kg (of salt) and higher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats.
The latter finding was not observed in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species investigated.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Oprymea 0.35 mg tablets
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each tablet contains 0.35 mg pramipexole base (as 0.5 mg pramipexole dihydrochloride monohydrate).
Please note:
Pramipexole doses as published in the literature refer to the salt form.
Therefore, doses will be expressed in terms of both pramipexole base and pramipexole salt (in brackets).
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Tablet.
0.35 mg: white, oval, with bevelled edges, both sides scored, with imprint "P8" on both halves of one side of the tablet.
The tablet can be divided into equal halves.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Oprymea is indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i. e. over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or “ on off” fluctuations).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Parkinson’ s disease The tablets should be taken orally, swallowed with water, and can be taken either with or without food.
The daily dosage is administered in equally divided doses 3 times a day.
Initial treatment Dosages should be increased gradually from a starting-dose of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day and then increased every 5 - 7 days.
Providing patients do not experience intolerable side-effects, the dosage should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.
Ascending – Dose Schedule of OPRYMEA Week

0.264 0.54 1.1
3 x 0.125 3 x 0.25 3 x 0.5
0.375 0.75 1.50
If a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.54 mg base (0.75 mg salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
18 However, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.8).
Maintenance treatment The individual dose should be in the range of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a maximum of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
During dose escalation in three pivotal studies, efficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt).
Further dose adjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions.
In clinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt).
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, doses higher than 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt) per day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended.
It is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the maintenance treatment with Oprymea, depending on reactions in individual patients.
Treatment discontinuation Abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Therefore, pramipexole should be tapered off at a rate of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt).
Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.4).
Dosing in patients with renal impairment The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function.
The following dosage schedule is suggested for initiation of therapy:
Patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/ min require no reduction in daily dose.
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/ min, the initial daily dose of Oprymea should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/ 0.25 mg of salt daily).
In patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/ min, the daily dose of Oprymea should be administered in a single dose, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) daily.
If renal function declines during maintenance therapy reduce Oprymea daily dose by the same percentage as the decline in creatinine clearance, i. e. if creatinine clearance declines by 30%, then reduce the Oprymea daily dose by 30%.
The daily dose can be administered in two divided doses if creatinine clearance is between 20 and 50 ml/ min, and as a single daily dose if creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/ min.
Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx.
90% of absorbed active substance is excreted through the kidneys.
However, the potential influence of hepatic insufficiency on Oprymea pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.
Dosing in children and adolescents Oprymea is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
19 When prescribing Oprymea in a patient with Parkinson’ s disease with renal impairment a reduced dose is suggested in line with section 4.2.
Hallucinations are known as a side-effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa.
Patients should be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesias can occur during the initial titration of Oprymea.
If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.
Pramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson’ s disease.
Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly.
Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Oprymea.
Patients who have experienced somnolence and/ or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines.
Furthermore a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medication or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see section 4.7 and section 4.8).
Pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality have been reported in patients treated with dopamine agonists for Parkinson’ s disease, including pramipexole.
Furthermore, patients and caregivers should be aware of the fact that behavioural changes can occur.
Dose reduction/ taper or discontinuation should be considered.
Patients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.5).
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.
In case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken.
It is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy.
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2)
Reports in the literature indicate that treatment of another indication with dopaminergic medicinal products can result in augmentation.
Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities.
The frequency of augmentation after longer use of pramipexole and the appropriate management of these events have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is seen in man.
Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or elimination by biotransformation are unlikely.
As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with anticholinergics has not been investigated.
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and levodopa.
20 Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules.
Therefore, medicinal products that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as cimetidine and amantadine, may interact with pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of either or both medicinal products.
Reduction of the pramipexole dose should be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly.
When Oprymea is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced and the dosage of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing the dose of Oprymea.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.4), e. g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans.
Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).
Oprymea should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i. e. if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
As pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected.
The excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women.
In rats, the concentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma.
In the absence of human data, Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding.
However, if its use is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Oprymea can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Hallucinations or somnolence can occur.
Patients being treated with Oprymea and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions are expected under the use of Oprymea: abnormal dreams, confusion, constipation, delusion, dizziness, dyskinesia, fatigue, hallucinations, headache, hyperkinesia, hypotension, increased eating (binge eating, hyperphagia), insomnia, libido disorders, nausea, peripheral oedema, paranoia, pathological gambling, hypersexuality and other abnormal behaviour; somnolence, weight increase, sudden onset of sleep; pruritus and rash and other hypersensitivity.
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,923 patients on pramipexole and 1,354 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently reported for both groups.
63% of patients on pramipexole and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse drug reaction.
The most commonly (≥ reported adverse reactions in patients with Parkinson’ s disease more 5%) frequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension,
21 dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue.
The incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.2).
More frequent adverse drug reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia.
Hypotension may occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.
The most commonly (≥
5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with other indication treated
with pramipexole were nausea, headache, dizziness and fatigue.
Nausea and fatigue were more often reported in female patients (20.8% and 10.5%, respectively) compared to males (6.7% and 7.3%, respectively).
Tables 1 and 2 display the frequency of adverse reactions from placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The adverse reactions reported in these tables are those events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with pramipexole and were reported significantly more often in patients taking pramipexole than placebo, or where the event was considered clinically relevant.
However, the majority of common adverse reactions were mild to moderate, they usually start early in therapy, and most tended to disappear even as therapy was continued.

0.264 0.54 1.1
3 x 0.125 3 x 0.25 3 x 0.5
0.375 0.75 1.50
If a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.54 mg base (0.75 mg salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
26 However, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.8).
Maintenance treatment The individual dose should be in the range of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a maximum of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
During dose escalation in three pivotal studies, efficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt).
Further dose adjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions.
In clinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt).
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, doses higher than 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt) per day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended.
It is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the maintenance treatment with Oprymea, depending on reactions in individual patients.
Treatment discontinuation Abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Therefore, pramipexole should be tapered off at a rate of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt).
Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.4).
Dosing in patients with renal impairment The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function.
The following dosage schedule is suggested for initiation of therapy:
Patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/ min require no reduction in daily dose.
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/ min, the initial daily dose of Oprymea should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/ 0.25 mg of salt daily).
In patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/ min, the daily dose of Oprymea shou ld be administered in a single dose, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) daily.
If renal function declines during maintenance therapy reduce Oprymea daily dose by the same percentage as the decline in creatinine clearance, i. e. if creatinine clearance declines by 30%, then reduce the Oprymea daily dose by 30%.
The daily dose can be administered in two divided doses if creatinine clearance is between 20 and 50 ml/ min, and as a single daily dose if creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/ min.
Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx.
90% of absorbed active substance is excreted through the kidneys.
However, the potential influence of hepatic insufficiency on Oprymea pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.
Dosing in children and adolescents Oprymea is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
27 When prescribing Oprymea in a patient with Parkinson’ s disease with renal impairment a reduced dose is suggested in line with section 4.2.
Hallucinations are known as a side-effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa.
Patients should be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesias can occur during the initial titration of Oprymea.
If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.
Pramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson’ s disease.
Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly.
Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Oprymea.
Patients who have experienced somnolence and/ or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines.
Furthermore a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medication or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see section 4.7 and section 4.8).
Pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality have been reported in patients treated with dopamine agonists for Parkinson’ s disease, including pramipexole.
Furthermore, patients and caregivers should be aware of the fact that behavioural changes can occur.
Dose reduction/ taper or discontinuation should be considered.
Patients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.5).
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.
In case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken.
It is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy.
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2)
Reports in the literature indicate that treatment of another indication with dopaminergic medicinal products can result in augmentation.
Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities.
The frequency of augmentation after longer use of pramipexole and the appropriate management of these events have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is seen in man.
Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or elimination by biotransformation are unlikely.
As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with anticholinergics has not been investigated.
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and levodopa.
Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules.
Therefore, medicinal products
28 that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as cimetidine and amantadine, may interact with pramipex ole resulting in reduced clearance of either or both medicinal products.
Reduction of the pramipexole dose should be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly.
When Oprymea is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced and the dosage of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing the dose of Oprymea.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.4), e. g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans.
Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).
Oprymea should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i. e. if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
As pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected.
The excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women.
In rats, the concentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma.
In the absence of human data, Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding.
However, if its use is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Oprymea can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Hallucinations or somnolence can occur.
Patients being treated with Oprymea and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions are expected under the use of Oprymea: abnormal dreams, confusion, constipation, delusion, dizziness, dyskinesia, fatigue, hallucinations, headache, hyperkinesia, hypotension, increased eating (binge eating, hyperphagia), insomnia, libido disorders, nausea, peripheral oedema, paranoia, pathological gambling, hypersexuality and other abnormal behaviour; somnolence, weight increase, sudden onset of sleep; pruritus and rash and other hypersensitivity.
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,923 patients on pramipexole and 1,354 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently reported for both groups.
63% of patients on pramipexole and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse drug reaction.
The most commonly (≥ reported adverse reactions in patients with Parkinson’ s disease more 5%) frequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue.
The incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.2).
More frequent adverse drug
29 reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia.
Hypotension may occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.
The most commonly (≥
5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with other indication treated
with pramipexole were nausea, headache, dizziness and fatigue.
Nausea and fatigue were more often reported in female patients (20.8% and 10.5%, respectively) compared to males (6.7% and 7.3%, respectively).
Tables 1 and 2 display the frequency of adverse reactions from placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The adverse reactions reported in these tables are those events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with pramipexole and were reported significantly more often in patients taking pramipexole than placebo, or where the event was considered clinically relevant.
However, the majority of common adverse reactions were mild to moderate, they usually start early in therapy, and most tended to disappear even as therapy was continued.

Pramipexole is associated with somnolence (8.6%) and has been associated uncommonly with excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes (0.1%).
See also section 4.4.
Pramipexole may be associated with libido disorders (increased (0.1%) or decreased (0.4%)).
Patients treated with dopamine agonists for Parkinson’ s disease, including pramipexole, especially at high doses, have been reported as exhibiting signs of pathological gambling, increase libido and hypersexuality, generally reversible upon treatment discontinuation.
4.9 Overdose
There is no clinical experience with massive overdose.
The expected adverse events would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension.
There is no established antidote for overdose 30 of a dopamine agonist.
If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent may be indicated.
Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of activated charcoal and electrocardiogram monitoring.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: dopamine agonists, ATC code:
N04BC05.
Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D 2 subfamily of dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D 3 receptors, and has full intrinsic activity.
Pramipexole alleviates Parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the striatum.
Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and turnover.
In human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed.
Clinical trials in Parkinson’ s disease
In patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson 's disease.
Controlled clinical trials included approximately 2100 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I – IV.
Out of these, approximately 900 were in more advanced stages, received concomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications.
In early and advanced Parkinson’ s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in the controlled clinical trials was maintained for approximately six months.
In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years there were no signs of decreasing efficacy.
In a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole significantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to initial treatment with levodopa.
This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be balanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean change in UPDRS-score).
The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally higher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group.
However there was no significant difference during the maintenance phase.
These points should be considered when initiating pramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson´s disease.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Pramipexole is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration.
The absolute bioavailability is greater than 90% and the maximum plasma concentrations occur between 1 and 3 hours.
Concomitant administration with food did not reduce the extent of pramipexole absorption, but the rate of absorption was reduced.
Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient variation of plasma levels.
In humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is large (400 l).
High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx.
8-fold compared to plasma).
Pramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent.
Renal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination.
Approximately 90% of 14 C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces.
The total clearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/ min and the renal clearance is approximat ely 400 ml/ min.
The elimination half-life (t½) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.
31 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving the CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole.
Decreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the mini pig, and a tendency to an hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey.
The potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and rabbits.
Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternally toxic doses.
Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, the adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated.
Pramipexole was not genotoxic.
In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell hyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole.
This finding is not clinically relevant to man.
The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/ kg (of salt) and higher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats.
The latter finding was not observed in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species investigated.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Oprymea is indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i. e. over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or “ on off” fluctuations).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Parkinson’ s disease The tablets should be taken orally, swallowed with water, and can be taken either with or without food.
The daily dosage is administered in equally divided doses 3 times a day.
Initial treatment Dosages should be increased gradually from a starting-dose of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day and then increased every 5 - 7 days.
Providing patients do not experience intolerable side-effects, the dosage should be titrated to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.

If a further dose increase is necessary the daily dose should be increased by 0.54 mg base (0.75 mg salt) at weekly intervals up to a maximum dose of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
34 However, it should be noted that the incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.8).
Maintenance treatment The individual dose should be in the range of 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) to a maximum of 3.3 mg of base (4.5 mg of salt) per day.
During dose escalation in three pivotal studies, efficacy was observed starting at a daily dose of 1.1 mg of base (1.5 mg of salt).
Further dose adjustments should be done based on the clinical response and the occurrence of adverse reactions.
In clinical trials approximately 5% of patients were treated at doses below 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt).
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, doses higher than 1.1 mg (1.5 mg of salt) per day can be useful in patients where a reduction of the levodopa therapy is intended.
It is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced during both the dose escalation and the maintenance treatment with Oprymea, depending on reactions in individual patients.
Treatment discontinuation Abrupt discontinuation of dopaminergic therapy can lead to the development of a neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Therefore, pramipexole should be tapered off at a rate of 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt) per day until the daily dose has been reduced to 0.54 mg of base (0.75 mg of salt).
Thereafter the dose should be reduced by 0.264 mg of base (0.375 mg of salt) per day (see section 4.4).
Dosing in patients with renal impairment The elimination of pramipexole is dependent on renal function.
The following dosage schedule is suggested for initiation of therapy:
Patients with a creatinine clearance above 50 ml/ min require no reduction in daily dose.
In patients with a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 ml/ min, the initial daily dose of Oprymea should be administered in two divided doses, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) twice a day (0.176 mg of base/ 0.25 mg of salt daily).
In patients with a creatinine clearance less than 20 ml/ min, the daily dose of Oprymea should be administered in a single dose, starting at 0.088 mg of base (0.125 mg of salt) daily.
If renal function declines during maintenance therapy reduce Oprymea daily dose by the same percentage as the decline in creatinine clearance, i. e. if creatinine clearance declines by 30%, then reduce the Oprymea daily dose by 30%.
The daily dose can be administered in two divided doses if creatinine clearance is between 20 and 50 ml/ min, and as a single daily dose if creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/ min.
Dosing in patients with hepatic impairment Dose adjustment in patients with hepatic failure is probably not necessary, as approx.
90% of absorbed active substance is excreted through the kidneys.
However, the potential influence of hepatic insufficiency on Oprymea pharmacokinetics has not been investigated.
Dosing in children and adolescents Oprymea is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
35 When prescribing Oprymea in a patient with Parkinson’ s disease with renal impairment a reduced dose is suggested in line with section 4.2.
Hallucinations are known as a side-effect of treatment with dopamine agonists and levodopa.
Patients should be informed that (mostly visual) hallucinations can occur.
In advanced Parkinson’ s disease, in combination treatment with levodopa, dyskinesias can occur during the initial titration of Oprymea.
If they occur, the dose of levodopa should be decreased.
Pramipexole has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset, particularly in patients with Parkinson’ s disease.
Sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, has been reported uncommonly.
Patients must be informed of this and advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with Oprymea.
Patients who have experienced somnolence and/ or an episode of sudden sleep onset must refrain from driving or operating machines.
Furthermore a reduction of dosage or termination of therapy may be considered.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medication or alcohol in combination with pramipexole (see section 4.7 and section 4.8).
Pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality have been reported in patients treated with dopamine agonists for Parkinson’ s disease, including pramipexole.
Furthermore, patients and caregivers should be aware of the fact that behavioural changes can occur.
Dose reduction/ taper or discontinuation should be considered.
Patients with psychotic disorders should only be treated with dopamine agonists if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.5).
Ophthalmologic monitoring is recommended at regular intervals or if vision abnormalities occur.
In case of severe cardiovascular disease, care should be taken.
It is recommended to monitor blood pressure, especially at the beginning of treatment, due to the general risk of postural hypotension associated with dopaminergic therapy.
Symptoms suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy (see section 4.2)
Reports in the literature indicate that treatment of another indication with dopaminergic medicinal products can result in augmentation.
Augmentation refers to the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities.
The frequency of augmentation after longer use of pramipexole and the appropriate management of these events have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low (< 20%) extent, and little biotransformation is seen in man.
Therefore, interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or elimination by biotransformation are unlikely.
As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by biotransformation, the potential for an interaction is limited, although an interaction with anticholinergics has not been investigated.
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and levodopa.
Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34%, presumably by inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules.
Therefore, medicinal products
36 that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway, such as cimetidine and amantadine, may interact with pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of either or both medicinal products.
Reduction of the pramipexole dose should be considered when these medicinal products are administered concomitantly.
When Oprymea is given in combination with levodopa, it is recommended that the dosage of levodopa is reduced and the dosage of other anti-parkinsonian medicinal products is kept constant while increasing the dose of Oprymea.
Because of possible additive effects, caution should be advised when patients are taking other sedating medicinal products or alcohol in combination with pramipexole.
Coadministration of antipsychotic medicinal products with pramipexole should be avoided (see section 4.4), e. g. if antagonistic effects can be expected.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The effect on pregnancy and lactation has not been investigated in humans.
Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits, but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3).
Oprymea should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i. e. if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
As pramipexole treatment inhibits secretion of prolactin in humans, inhibition of lactation is expected.
The excretion of pramipexole into breast milk has not been studied in women.
In rats, the concentration of active substance-related radioactivity was higher in breast milk than in plasma.
In the absence of human data, Oprymea should not be used during breast-feeding.
However, if its use is unavoidable, breast-feeding should be discontinued.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Oprymea can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Hallucinations or somnolence can occur.
Patients being treated with Oprymea and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes and somnolence have resolved (see also sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions are expected under the use of Oprymea: abnormal dreams, confusion, constipation, delusion, dizziness, dyskinesia, fatigue, hallucinations, headache, hyperkinesia, hypotension, increased eating (binge eating, hyperphagia), insomnia, libido disorders, nausea, peripheral oedema, paranoia, pathological gambling, hypersexuality and other abnormal behaviour; somnolence, weight increase, sudden onset of sleep; pruritus and rash and other hypersensitivity.
Based on the analysis of pooled placebo-controlled trials, comprising a total of 1,923 patients on pramipexole and 1,354 patients on placebo, adverse drug reactions were frequently reported for both groups.
63% of patients on pramipexole and 52% of patients on placebo reported at least one adverse drug reaction.
The most commonly (≥ reported adverse reactions in patients with Parkinson’ s disease more 5%) frequent with pramipexole treatment than with placebo were nausea, dyskinesia, hypotension, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, constipation, hallucination, headache and fatigue.
The incidence of somnolence is increased at doses higher than 1.5 mg/ day (see section 4.2).
More frequent adverse drug
37 reaction in combination with levodopa was dyskinesia.
Hypotension may occur at the beginning of treatment, especially if pramipexole is titrated too fast.
The most commonly (≥
5%) reported adverse drug reactions in patients with other indication treated
with pramipexole were nausea, headache, dizziness and fatigue.
Nausea and fatigue were more often reported in female patients (20.8% and 10.5%, respectively) compared to males (6.7% and 7.3%, respectively).
Tables 1 and 2 display the frequency of adverse reactions from placebo-controlled clinical trials.
The adverse reactions reported in these tables are those events that occurred in 1% or more of patients treated with pramipexole and were reported significantly more often in patients taking pramipexole than placebo, or where the event was considered clinically relevant.
However, the majority of common adverse reactions were mild to moderate, they usually start early in therapy, and most tended to disappear even as therapy was continued.

Pramipexole may be associated with libido disorders (increased (0.1%) or decreased (0.4%)).
Patients treated with dopamine agonists for Parkinson’ s disease, including pramipexole, especially at high doses, have been reported as exhibiting signs of pathological gambling, increase libido and hypersexuality, generally reversible upon treatment discontinuation.
4.9 Overdose
There is no clinical experience with massive overdose.
The expected adverse events would be those related to the pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including nausea, vomiting, hyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and hypotension.
There is no established antidote for overdose 38 of a dopamine agonist.
If signs of central nervous system stimulation are present, a neuroleptic agent may be indicated.
Management of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of activated charcoal and electrocardiogram monitoring.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: dopamine agonists, ATC code:
N04BC05.
Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that binds with high selectivity and specificity to the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors of which it has a preferential affinity to D 3 receptors, and has full intrinsic activity.
Pramipexole alleviates Parkinsonian motor deficits by stimulation of dopamine receptors in the striatum.
Animal studies have shown that pramipexole inhibits dopamine synthesis, release, and turnover.
In human volunteers, a dose-dependent decrease in prolactin was observed.
Clinical trials in Parkinson’ s disease
In patients pramipexole alleviates signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson 's disease.
Controlled clinical trials included approximately 2100 patients of Hoehn and Yahr stages I – IV.
Out of these, approximately 900 were in more advanced stages, received concomitant levodopa therapy, and suffered from motor complications.
In early and advanced Parkinson’ s disease, efficacy of pramipexole in the controlled clinical trials was maintained for approximately six months.
In open continuation trials lasting for more than three years there were no signs of decreasing efficacy.
In a controlled double blind clinical trial of 2 year duration, initial treatment with pramipexole significantly delayed the onset of motor complications, and reduced their occurrence compared to initial treatment with levodopa.
This delay in motor complications with pramipexole should be balanced against a greater improvement in motor function with levodopa (as measured by the mean change in UPDRS-score).
The overall incidence of hallucinations and somnolence was generally higher in the escalation phase with the pramipexole group.
However there was no significant difference during the maintenance phase.
These points should be considered when initiating pramipexole treatment in patients with Parkinson´s disease.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Pramipexole is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration.
The absolute bioavailability is greater than 90% and the maximum plasma concentrations occur between 1 and 3 hours.
Concomitant administration with food did not reduce the extent of pramipexole absorption, but the rate of absorption was reduced.
Pramipexole shows linear kinetics and a small inter-patient variation of plasma levels.
In humans, the protein binding of pramipexole is very low (< 20%) and the volume of distribution is large (400 l).
High brain tissue concentrations were observed in the rat (approx.
8-fold compared to plasma).
Pramipexole is metabolised in man only to a small extent.
Renal excretion of unchanged pramipexole is the major route of elimination.
Approximately 90% of 14 C-labelled dose is excreted through the kidneys while less than 2% is found in the faeces.
The total clearance of pramipexole is approximately 500 ml/ min and the renal clearance is approximately 400 ml/ min.
The elimination half-life (t½) varies from 8 hours in the young to 12 hours in the elderly.
39 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Repeated dose toxicity studies showed that pramipexole exerted functional effects, mainly involving the CNS and female reproductive system, and probably resulting from an exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect of pramipexole.
Decreases in diastolic and systolic pressure and heart rate were noted in the mini pig, and a tendency to an hypotensive effect was discerned in the monkey.
The potential effects of pramipexole on reproductive function have been investigated in rats and rabbits.
Pramipexole was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits but was embryotoxic in the rat at maternally toxic doses.
Due to the selection of animal species and the limited parameters investigated, the adverse effects of pramipexole on pregnancy and male fertility have not been fully elucidated.
Pramipexole was not genotoxic.
In a carcinogenicity study, male rats developed Leydig cell hyperplasia and adenomas, explained by the prolactin-inhibiting effect of pramipexole.
This finding is not clinically relevant to man.
The same study also showed that, at doses of 2 mg/ kg (of salt) and higher, pramipexole was associated with retinal degeneration in albino rats.
The latter finding was not observed in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity study or in any other species investigated.

1.
WHAT OPRYMEA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Oprymea belongs to a group of medicines known as dopamine agonists which stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain.
Stimulation of the dopamine receptors triggers nerve impulses in the brain that help to control body movements.
Oprymea is used to treat the symptoms of primary Parkinson's disease.
It can be used alone or in combination with levodopa.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE OPRYMEA
DO NOT take Oprymea
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to pramipexole or any of the other ingredients of Oprymea
(see section 6.
"Further information").
Take special care with Oprymea Tell your doctor if you have or have had or develop any medical conditions or symptoms, especially any of the following:
- Kidney disease.
- Hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there).
Most hallucinations are
visual.
- Dyskinesia (e. g. abnormal, uncontrolled movements of the limbs).
If you have advanced
Parkinson’ s disease and are also taking levodopa, you might develop dyskinesia during the uptitration of Oprymea.
- Sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep.
- Behavioural changes (e. g. pathological gambling), increased libido (e. g. increased sexual
desire), binge eating.
- Psychosis (e. g. comparable with symptoms of schizophrenia).
- Vision impairment.
You should have regular eye examinations during treatment with Oprymea.
102
- Severe heart or blood vessels disease.
You will need to have your blood pressure checked
regularly, especially at the beginning of treatment.
This is to avoid postural hypotension (a fall in blood pressure on standing up).
Children and adolescents Oprymea is not recommended for use in children or adolescents under 18 years.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.
This includes medicines, herbal remedies, health foods or supplements that you have obtained without a prescription.
You should avoid taking Oprymea together with antipsychotic medicines.
Take care if you are taking the following medicines:
- cimetidine (to treat excess stomach acid and stomach ulcers);
- amantadine (which can be used to treat Parkinson’ s disease).
If you are taking levodopa, the dose of levodopa is recommended to be reduced when you start treatment with Oprymea.
Take care if you are using any medicines that calm you down (have a sedative effect) or if you drink alcohol.
In this cases Oprymea may effect your ability to drive and operate machinery.
Taking Oprymea with food and drink You should be cautious while drinking alcohol during treatment with Oprymea.
Oprymea can be taken with or without food.
The tablets should be taken with water.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant or if you intend to become pregnant.
Your doctor will then discuss with you if you should continue to take Oprymea.
The effect of Oprymea on the unborn child is not known.
Therefore, do not take Oprymea if you are pregnant unless your doctor tells you to do so.
Oprymea is not recommended during breast-feeding.
Oprymea can reduce the production of breast milk.
Also, it can pass into the breast milk and can reach your baby.
If treatment with Oprymea is unavoidable, breast-feeding must be stopped.
Driving and using machines Oprymea can cause hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there).
If affected, do not drive or use machines.
Oprymea has been associated with sleepiness and episodes of suddenly falling asleep, particularly in patients with Parkinson’ s disease.
If you experience these side effects, you must not drive or operate machinery.
Please tell your doctor if this occurs.
3.

Always take Oprymea exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

Swallow the tablets with water.
Patients with kidney disease If you have moderate or severe kidney disease, your doctor will prescribe a lower dose.
In this case, you will have to take the tablets only once or twice a day.
If you have moderate kidney disease, the usual starting dose is 1 tablet Oprymea 0.088 mg twice a day.
In severe kidney disease, the usual starting dose is just 1 tablet Oprymea 0.088 mg a day.
If you take more Oprymea than you should If you accidentally took too many tablets:
- Contact your doctor or nearest hospital casualty department immediately for advice.
- You may experience vomiting, restlessness, or any of the side effects as described in section 4.
"Possible side effects".
If you forget to take Oprymea Do not worry.
Simply leave out that dose completely and then take your next dose at the right time.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.
If you stop taking Oprymea Do not stop taking Oprymea without first talking to your doctor.
If you have to stop taking this medicine, your doctor will reduce the dose gradually.
This reduces the risk of worsening symptoms.
If you suffer from Parkinson’ s disease you should not stop treatment with Oprymea abruptly.
A sudden stop could cause you to develop a medicinal condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome which may represent a major health risk.
The symptoms include:
- akinesia (loss of muscle movement),
- rigid muscles,
104
- fever,
- unstable blood pressure,
- tachycardia (increased heart rate),
- confusion,
- depressed level of consciousness (e. g. coma).
