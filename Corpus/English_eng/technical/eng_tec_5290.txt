Migrating from PHP / FI 2 to PHP 3
Next
The first thing you probably will notice is that PHP 's start and end tags have changed.
The old? form has been replaced by three new possible forms:
Example C-1.
Migration: old start / end tags
? echo "This is PHP / FI 2.0 code.\n";?
Example C-2.
Migration: first new start / end tags
? echo "This is PHP 3.0 code!\n";?
Example C-3.
Migration: second new start / end tags
?php echo "This is PHP 3.0 code!\n";?
Example C-4.
Migration: third new start / end tags
script language=" php "echo "This is PHP 3.0 code!\n"; / script
