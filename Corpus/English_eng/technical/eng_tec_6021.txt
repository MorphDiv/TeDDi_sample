Invitations are normally sent as attachments to a mail. This switch changes the invitation mails to be sent in the text of the mail instead; this is necessary to send invitations and replies to Microsoft Outlook. But, when you do this, you no longer get descriptive text that mail programs can read; so, to people who have email programs that do not understand the invitations, the resulting messages look very odd. People that have email programs that do understand invitations will still be able to work with this.

Act on new/ unread mail in this folder
If this option is enabled then you will be notified about new/ unread mail in this folder. Moreover, going to the next/ previous folder with unread messages will stop at this folder. Uncheck this option if you do not want to be notified about new/ unread mail in this folder and if you want this folder to be skipped when going to the next/ previous folder with unread messages. This is useful for ignoring any new/ unread mail in your trash and spam folder.
Include this folder in mail checks
If this option is enabled this folder will be included while checking new emails. Uncheck this option if you want to skip this folder while checking new emails.
Keep replies in this folder
Check this option if you want replies you write to mails in this folder to be put in this same folder after sending, instead of in the configured sent-mail folder.
Hide this folder in the folder selection dialog
Check this option if you do not want this folder to be shown in folder selection dialogs, such as the Jump to Folder dialog.
Use & default identity
& Sender identity:
Select the sender identity to be used when writing new mail or replying to mail in this folder. This means that if you are in one of your work folders, you can make KMail use the corresponding sender email address, signature and signing or encryption keys automatically. Identities can be set up in the main configuration dialog. (Settings - > Configure KMail)
& Folder contents:
Generate free/ busy and activate alarms for:
Nobody
Admins of This Folder
All Readers of This Folder
This setting defines which users sharing this folder should get "busy" periods in their freebusy lists and should see the alarms for the events or tasks in this folder. The setting applies to Calendar and Task folders only (for tasks, this setting is only used for alarms). Example use cases: if the boss shares a folder with his secretary, only the boss should be marked as busy for his meetings, so he should select "Admins", since the secretary has no admin rights on the folder. On the other hand if a working group shares a Calendar for group meetings, all readers of the folders should be marked as busy for meetings. A company-wide folder with optional events in it would use "Nobody" since it is not known who will go to those events.
This setting allows you to disable alarms for folders shared by others.
Block free/ busy and alarms locally
Share unread state with all users
If enabled, the unread state of messages in this folder will be the same for all users having access to this folder. If disabled (the default), every user with access to this folder has their own unread state.
You have configured this folder to contain groupware information and the general configuration option to hide groupware folders is set. That means that this folder will disappear once the configuration dialog is closed. If you want to remove the folder again, you will need to temporarily disable hiding of groupware folders to be able to see it.

Message Part Properties
The MIME type of the file: normally, you do not need to touch this setting, since the type of the file is automatically checked; but, sometimes, %1 may not detect the type correctly -- here is where you can fix that.
The size of the part: sometimes, %1 will only give an estimated size here, because calculating the exact size would take too much time; when this is the case, it will be made visible by adding "(est.)" to the size displayed.
The file name of the part: although this defaults to the name of the attached file, it does not specify the file to be attached; rather, it suggests a file name to be used by the recipient's mail agent when saving the part to disk.
& Description:
A description of the part: this is just an informational description of the part, much like the Subject is for the whole message; most mail agents will show this information in their message previews alongside the attachment's icon.
& Encoding:
The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.
Suggest & automatic display
Check this option if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this part in the message preview, instead of the default icon view; technically, this is carried out by setting this part's Content-Disposition header field to "inline" instead of the default "attachment".
& Sign this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be signed; the signature will be made with the key that you associated with the currently-selected identity.
Encrypt this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted; the part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message

Signing
& Automatically sign messages
When this option is enabled, all messages you send will be signed by default; of course, it is still possible to disable signing for each message individually.
Encrypting
When encrypting emails, always also encrypt to the certificate of my own identity
When this option is enabled, the message/ file will not only be encrypted with the receiver's public key, but also with your key. This will enable you to decrypt the message/ file at a later time. This is generally a good idea.
Show signed/ encrypted text after composing
When this option is enabled, the signed/ encrypted text will be shown in a separate window, enabling you to know how it will look before it is sent. This is a good idea when you are verifying that your encryption system works.
Store sent messages encrypted
Check to store messages encrypted
Store Messages Encrypted When this box is checked, sent messages are stored encrypted like they were sent. This is not recommended, as you will not be able to read the messages any longer if a necessary certificate expires. However, there may be local rules that require you to turn this option on. When in doubt, check with your local administrator.
Always show the encryption keys & for approval
When this option is enabled, the application will always show you a list of public keys from which you can choose the one it will use for encryption. If it is off, the application will only show the dialog if it cannot find the right key or if there are several which could be used.
Automatically encrypt & messages whenever possible
When this option is enabled, every message you send will be encrypted whenever encryption is possible and desired; of course, it is still possible to disable the automatic encryption for each message individually.
Never sign/ encrypt when saving as draft

Whether to store the password or ask for it when checking for new mail
Check this option to have KMail store the password. If KWallet is available the password will be stored there which is considered safe. However, if KWallet is not available, the password will be stored in KMail's configuration file. The password is stored in an obfuscated format, but should not be considered secure from decryption efforts if access to the configuration file is obtained.

Check this option to have KMail store the password. If KWallet is available the password will be stored there which is considered safe. However, if KWallet is not available, the password will be stored in KMail's configuration file. The password is stored in an obfuscated format, but should not be considered secure from decryption efforts if access to the configuration file is obtained.

HTML Messages
WARNING: Allowing HTML in email may increase the risk that your system will be compromised by present and anticipated security exploits. More about HTML mails... More about external references...
Messages sometimes come in both formats. This option controls whether you want the HTML part or the plain text part to be displayed. Displaying the HTML part makes the message look better, but at the same time increases the risk of security holes being exploited. Displaying the plain text part loses much of the message's formatting, but makes it almost impossible to exploit security holes in the HTML renderer (Konqueror). The option below guards against one common misuse of HTML messages, but it cannot guard against security issues that were not known at the time this version of KMail was written. It is therefore advisable to not prefer HTML to plain text. Note: You can set this option on a per-folder basis from the Folder menu of KMail's main window.
Prefer HTML to plain text
Some mail advertisements are in HTML and contain references to, for example, images that the advertisers employ to find out that you have read their message ("web bugs"). There is no valid reason to load images off the Internet like this, since the sender can always attach the required images directly to the message. To guard from such a misuse of the HTML displaying feature of KMail, this option is disabled by default. However, if you wish to, for example, view images in HTML messages that were not attached to it, you can enable this option, but you should be aware of the possible problem.
Allow messages to load external references from the Internet

Message Disposition Notifications
Send policy:
Message Disposition Notification Policy MDNs are a generalization of what is commonly called read receipt. The message author requests a disposition notification to be sent and the receiver's mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened to his message. Common disposition types include displayed (i. e. read), deleted and dispatched (e. g. forwarded). The following options are available to control KMail's sending of MDNs: Ignore: Ignores any request for disposition notifications. No MDN will ever be sent automatically (recommended). Ask: Answers requests only after asking the user for permission. This way, you can send MDNs for selected messages while denying or ignoring them for others. Deny: Always sends a denied notification. This is only slightly better than always sending MDNs. The author will still know that the messages has been acted upon, he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc. Always send: Always sends the requested disposition notification. That means that the author of the message gets to know when the message was acted upon and, in addition, what happened to it (displayed, deleted, etc.). This option is strongly discouraged, but since it makes much sense e. g. for customer relationship management, it has been made available.

If this option is selected, S/ MIME certificates are validated using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
Validate certificates using CRLs
If this option is selected, S/ MIME certificates are validated online using the Online Certificates Status Protocol (OCSP). Fill in the URL of the OCSP responder below.

OCSP responder URL:
OCSP responder signature:
Enter here the address of the server for online validation of certificates (OCSP responder). The URL is usually starting with http: / /.

By default GnuPG uses the file ~/. gnupg/ policies. txt to check if a certificate policy is allowed. If this option is selected, policies are not checked.
Do not check certificate policies
If this option is checked, Certificate Revocation Lists are never used to validate S/ MIME certificates.

If this option is checked, missing issuer certificates are fetched when necessary (this applies to both validation methods, CRLs and OCSP)

HTTP Requests
Entirely disables the use of HTTP for S/ MIME.
Do not perform any HTTP requests
When looking for the location of a CRL, the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the HTTP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.
Ignore HTTP CRL distribution point of certificates
If this option is selected, the value of the HTTP proxy shown on the right (which comes from the environment variable http_proxy) will be used for any HTTP request.
Use system HTTP proxy:
Use this proxy for HTTP requests:
Enter here the location of your HTTP Proxy, which will be used for all HTTP requests relating to S/ MIME. The syntax is host: port, for instance myproxy. nowhere. com:3128.
LDAP Requests

Do not perform any LDAP requests
When looking for the location of a CRL, the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the LDAP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.
Ignore LDAP CRL distribution point of certificates
Primary host for LDAP requests:
Entering a LDAP server here will make all LDAP requests go to that server first. More precisely, this setting overrides any specified host and port part in a LDAP URL and will also be used if host and port have been omitted from the URL. Other LDAP servers will be used only if the connection to the "proxy" failed. The syntax is "HOST" or "HOST: PORT". If PORT is omitted, port 389 (standard LDAP port) is used.

By default, & message folders on disk are:
This selects which mailbox format will be the default for local folders: mbox: KMail's mail folders are represented by a single file each. Individual messages are separated from each other by a line starting with "From". This saves space on disk, but may be less robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders. maildir: KMail's mail folders are represented by real folders on disk. Individual messages are separate files. This may waste a bit of space on disk, but should be more robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders.

When this is checked, you will not see the mail composer window. Instead, all invitation mails are sent automatically. If you want to see the mail before sending it, you can uncheck this option. However, be aware that the text in the composer window is in iCalendar syntax, and you should not try modifying it by hand.
When this is checked, received invitation emails that have been replied to will be moved to the Trash folder, once the reply has been successfully sent.
Enabling this makes it possible to store the entries from the Kontact applications (KOrganizer, KAddressBook, and KNotes.) If you want to set this option you must also set the applications to use the IMAP resource; this is done in the KDE System Settings.
Usually you will not have any reason to see the folders that hold the IMAP resources. But if you need to see them, you can set that here.
If the account used for storing groupware information is not used to manage normal mail, set this option to make KMail only show groupware folders in it. This is useful if you are handling regular mail via an additional online IMAP account.
Choose the storage format of the groupware folders. The default format is to use the ical (for calendar folders) and vcard (for address book folders) standards. This format makes all Kontact features available. The Kolab XML format uses a custom model that matches more closely the one used in Outlook. This format gives better Outlook compatibility, when using a Kolab server or a compatible solution.
This chooses the parent of the IMAP resource folders. By default, the Kolab server sets the IMAP inbox to be the parent.
This is the ID of the account holding the IMAP resource folders.
If you want to set the folder names of the IMAP storage to your local language, you can choose between these available languages. Please note, that the only reason to do so is for compatibility with Microsoft Outlook. It is considered a bad idea to set this, since it makes changing languages impossible. So do not set this unless you have to.

Also filter new mails received in groupware folders.

This is the list of defined filters. They are processed top-to-bottom. Click on any filter to edit it using the controls in the right-hand half of the dialog.
Click this button to create a new filter. The filter will be inserted just before the currently-selected one, but you can always change that later on. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Delete button.
Click this button to copy a filter. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Delete button.
Click this button to delete the currently-selected filter from the list above. There is no way to get the filter back once it is deleted, but you can always leave the dialog by clicking Cancel to discard the changes made.
Click this button to move the currently-selected filter up one in the list above. This is useful since the order of the filters in the list determines the order in which they are tried on messages: The topmost filter gets tried first. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Down button.
Click this button to move the currently-selected filter down one in the list above. This is useful since the order of the filters in the list determines the order in which they are tried on messages: The topmost filter gets tried first. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Up button.
Click this button to rename the currently-selected filter. Filters are named automatically, as long as they start with "lt;". If you have renamed a filter accidentally and want automatic naming back, click this button and select Clear followed by OK in the appearing dialog.
Check this button to force the confirmation dialog to be displayed. This is useful if you have defined a ruleset that tags messages to be downloaded later. Without the possibility to force the dialog popup, these messages could never be downloaded if no other large messages were waiting on the server, or if you wanted to change the ruleset to tag the messages differently.

The server does not seem to support unique message numbers, but this is a requirement for leaving messages on the server. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn leaving fetched messages on the server on.
The server does not seem to support fetching message headers, but this is a requirement for filtering messages on the server. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn filtering messages on the server on.
Please note that this feature can cause some POP3 servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupted mail; this is configurable, though, because some servers support pipelining but do not announce their capabilities. To check whether your POP3 server announces pipelining support use the "Check What the Server Supports" button at the bottom of the Security tab in this dialog; if your server does not announce it, but you want more speed, then you should do some testing first by sending yourself a batch of mail and downloading it.
Please specify a server and port on the General tab first.
The server does not seem to support pipelining; therefore, this option has been disabled. Since some servers do not correctly announce their capabilities you still have the possibility to turn pipelining on. But please note that this feature can cause some POP servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupt messages. So before using this feature with important mail you should first test it by sending yourself a larger number of test messages which you all download in one go from the POP server.

Sorry, no spam detection tools have been found. Install your spam detection software and re-run this wizard.

Messages classified as spam are marked as read. Spam messages are not moved into a certain folder.

The wizard will create the following filters: %1
The wizard will replace the following filters: %1
The wizard will search for any tools to do spam detection and setup KMail to work with them.
Here you can get some assistance in setting up KMail's filter rules to use some commonly-known anti-virus tools. The wizard can detect those tools on your computer as well as create filter rules to classify messages using these tools and to separate messages containing viruses. The wizard will not take any existing filter rules into consideration: it will always append the new rules. Warning: As KMail appears to be frozen during the scan of the messages for viruses, you may encounter problems with the responsiveness of KMail because anti-virus tool operations are usually time consuming; please consider deleting the filter rules created by the wizard to get back to the former behavior.
Please select the tools to be used for the detection and go to the next page.
& Mark detected spam messages as read
Mark messages which have been classified as spam as read.
Move & known spam to:
The default folder for spam messages is the trash folder, but you may change that in the folder view below.
Move & probable spam to:
The default folder is the inbox folder, but you may change that in the folder view below. Not all tools support a classification as unsure. If you have not selected a capable tool, you cannot select a folder as well.
Check messages using the anti-virus tools
Let the anti-virus tools check your messages. The wizard will create appropriate filters. The messages are usually marked by the tools so that following filters can react on this and, for example, move virus messages to a special folder.
Move detected viral messages to the selected folder
A filter to detect messages classified as virus-infected and to move those messages into a predefined folder is created. The default folder is the trash folder, but you may change that in the folder view.
Additionally, mark detected viral messages as read
Mark messages which have been classified as virus-infected as read, as well as moving them to the selected folder.
