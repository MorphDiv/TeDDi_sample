PHP offers the ability to create Shockwave Flash files via Paul Haeberli 's libswf module.
Note:
SWF support was added in PHP 4 RC2.
The libswf does not have support for Windows.
The development of that library has been stopped, and the source is not available to port it to another systems.
For up to date SWF support take a look at the MING functions.
You need the libswf library to compile PHP with support for this extension.
You can download libswf at ftp: / /ftp.sgi.com / sgi / graphics / grafica / flash.
Once you have libswf all you need to do is to configure --with-swf[ =DIR] Once you have libswf all you need to do is to configure --with-swf[=DIR] where DIR is a location containing the directories include and lib.
The include directory has to contain the swf.h file and the lib directory has to contain the libswf.a file.
If you unpack the libswf distribution the two files will be in one directory.
Consequently you will have to copy the files to the proper location manually.
This extension has no configuration directives defined in php.ini.
This extension has no resource types defined.
The constants below are defined by this extension, and will only be available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.
Once you 've successfully installed PHP with Shockwave Flash support you can then go about creating Shockwave files from PHP.
You would be surprised at what you can do, take the following code:
Example 1.
SWF example
?php swf_openfile ("test.swf", 256, 256, 30, 1, 1, 1); swf_ortho2 (-100, 100, -100, 100); swf_defineline (1, -70, 0, 70, 0, .2); swf_definerect (4, 60, -10, 70, 0, 0); swf_definerect (5, -60, 0, -70, 10, 0); swf_addcolor (0, 0, 0, 0); swf_definefont (10, "Mod"); swf_fontsize (5); swf_fontslant (10); swf_definetext (11, "This be Flash wit PHP !", 1); swf_pushmatrix (); swf_translate (-50, 80, 0); swf_placeobject (11, 60); swf_popmatrix (); for ($i = 0; $i 30; $i++) {$p = $i / (30-1); swf_pushmatrix (); swf_scale (1 -($p*.9), 1, 1); swf_rotate (60*$p, 'z'); swf_translate (20+20*$p, $p / 1.5, 0); swf_rotate (270*$p, 'z'); swf_addcolor ($p, 0, $p / 1.2, -$p); swf_placeobject (1, 50); swf_placeobject (4, 50); swf_placeobject (5, 50); swf_popmatrix (); swf_showframe ();} for ($i = 0; $i 30; $i++) {swf_removeobject (50); if (($i%4) == 0) {swf_showframe ();}} swf_startdoaction (); swf_actionstop (); swf_enddoaction (); swf_closefile ();?
