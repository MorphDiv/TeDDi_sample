This plugin checks & XML; files for well-formedness and validity.

DTD
Introduction
This plugin checks the current file. A list of warnings and errors will appears at the bottom of & kate; 's main window. You can click on an error message to jump to the corresponding place in the file. If the file has a DOCTYPE the DTD given with this doctype will be used to check the file for validity. The DTD is expected at a position relative to the current file, & eg; if the doctype refers to DTD/ xhtml1-transitional. dtd and the file is / home/ peter/ test. xml the DTD is expected to be located at / home/ peter/ DTD/ xhtml1-transitional. dtd. However, remote DTDs specified via http are supported.
If the file has no doctype it will be checked for well-formedness.
To learn more about & XML; check out the official W3C & XML; pages.
Internally this plugin calls the external command xmllint, which is part of libxml2. If this command is not correctly installed on your system, the plugin will not work.
A temporary file needs to be written to the same folder as the file that should be checked, so you need to have write access to that folder.
To load this plugin open & kate; s configuration dialog under Settings Configure & kate;.... Then select Kate XML Validation which will appear in the Application / Plugins section and close the dialog.

This will start the check, as described above.
