GNOME Klotski
GNOME Klotski is a set of block sliding puzzles. The objective is to move the patterned block to the area bordered by green markers. To do so, you'll need to slide other blocks out of the way. Complete each puzzle in as few moves as possible!
GNOME Klotski comes with nearly thirty different puzzle layouts of varying difficulty. Some of the layouts are similar and only the size of one or more blocks differ. Other layouts have more variety.
