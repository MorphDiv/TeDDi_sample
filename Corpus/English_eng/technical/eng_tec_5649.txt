Introduction
Gametype:
Logic, Arcade
Number of possible players:
One
& kblocks; is the classic falling blocks game. The idea is stack the falling blocks in a way that lines are completely filled. When a line is completed it is removed, and more space is available in the play area. When there is not enough space for blocks to fall, the game is over.
How to Play
Objective:
Rotate the falling blocks, and fit them together to complete lines and clear the playfield.
By default, falling blocks can be moved left or right using the Left or Right arrow keys. The Down arrow key makes the block drop faster, and the Up key is used to rotate the block. The keys used for each game action can be configured in Settings Configure Shortcuts...
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Rules
The rules are simple: just keep space for the blocks to fall!
When a new block cannot fall, the game is over.
Strategies and Tips
Do not forget to check the preview area: it shows the next piece that will be released.
For additional points, try to remove several lines at once.
