Read Error Rate
Frequency of errors while reading raw data from the disk. A non-zero value indicates a problem with either the disk surface or read/write heads
Throughput Performance
Average efficiency of the disk
Spinup Time
Time needed to spin up the disk
Start/Stop Count
Number of spindle start/stop cycles
Reallocated Sector Count
Count of remapped sectors. When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it marks the sector as "reallocated" and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area)
Read Channel Margin
Margin of a channel while reading data.
Seek Error Rate
Frequency of errors while positioning
Seek Timer Performance
Average efficiency of operations while positioning
Power-On Hours
Number of hours elapsed in the power-on state
Spinup Retry Count
Number of retry attempts to spin up
Calibration Retry Count
Number of attempts to calibrate the device
Power Cycle Count
Number of power-on events
Soft read error rate
Frequency of 'program' errors while reading from the disk
Reported Uncorrectable Errors

Current Pending Sector Count
Number of sectors waiting to be remapped. If the sector waiting to be remapped is subsequently written or read successfully, this value is decreased and the sector is not remapped. Read errors on the sector will not remap the sector, it will only be remapped on a failed write attempt
Uncorrectable Sector Count
The total number of uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector. A rise in the value of this attribute indicates defects of the disk surface and/or problems in the mechanical subsystem
