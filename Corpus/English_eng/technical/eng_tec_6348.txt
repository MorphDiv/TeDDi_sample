Enhanced Browsing In this module you can configure some enhanced browsing features of KDE. Web Shortcuts Web Shortcuts are a quick way of using Web search engines. For example, type "altavista: frobozz" or "av: frobozz" and Konqueror will do a search on AltaVista for "frobozz". Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

& Filters
& Enable Web shortcuts
Enable shortcuts that allow you to quickly search for information on the web. For example, entering the shortcut gg: KDE will result in a search of the word KDE on the Google(TM) search engine.
& Keyword delimiter:
Choose the delimiter that separates the keyword from the phrase or word to be searched.
Default & search engine:
Select the search engine to use for input boxes that provide automatic lookup services when you type in normal words and phrases instead of a URL. To disable this feature select None from the list.

Name
Shortcuts
List of search providers, their associated shortcuts and whether they shall be listed in menus.
Colon
Space
Enter the human readable name of the search provider here.
& Charset:
Select the character set that will be used to encode your search query
Search & URI:
Enter the URI that is used to do a search on the search engine here. The whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\{@} or \\{0}. Recommended is \\{@}, since it removes all query variables (name=value) from the resulting string whereas \\{0} will be substituted with the unmodified query string. You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{name} to specify a value given by'name=value 'in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as substitution value for the resulting URI. A quoted string can be used as default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.
Search & provider name:
The shortcuts entered here can be used as a pseudo-URI scheme in KDE. For example, the shortcut av can be used as in av: my search
URI shortcuts:
Select the character set that will be used to encode your search query.
In this module you can configure the web shortcuts feature. Web shortcuts allow you to quickly search or lookup words on the Internet. For example, to search for information about the KDE project using the Google engine, you simply type gg: KDE or google: KDE. If you select a default search engine, normal words or phrases will be looked up at the specified search engine by simply typing them into applications, such as Konqueror, that have built-in support for such a feature.

The URI does not contain a \\{...} placeholder for the user query. This means that the same page is always going to be visited, regardless of what the user types.
Keep It
%1 does not have a home folder.
There is no user called %1.
The file or folder %1 does not exist.
& ShortURLs
_: NOTE_TO_THE_TRANSLATORS By default, the web shortcuts will all go to the international versions of each site (e. g. google. com), not to the local site (e. g. google. de). To change this, add extra'Query[foo]=... 'lines to the. desktop files in kdebase/ kcontrol/ ebrowsing/ plugins/ ikws/ searchproviders. For example, in google. desktop, copy the original Query=... line to Query[foo]=... and change its URL so it uses google. foo instead of google. com. (translate this message as DONE when you have added the extra query URLs; otherwise, leave it untranslated as a reminder.)
