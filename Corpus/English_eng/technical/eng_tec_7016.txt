The Text tool in Toolbox
The Text tool places text into an image. With
As soon as you type your text, it appears on the canvas in a rectangular frame. If you draw the rectangular frame first, the text is automatically adapted to the frame size. You can enlarge this frame as you do with rectangular selections.
To move the text on canvas, you have to select the Move tool and click on a character to drag the frame and its text.
You can access this tool in several ways:
In the image menu through

Normally, tool options are displayed in a window attached under the Toolbox as soon as you activate a tool. If they are not, you can access them from the image menu bar through

Choose a font from the installed fonts. When you select a font it is interactively applied to your text.
You can use the scroll wheel of your pointing device (usually your mouse) on the fonts button in order to quickly change the font of your text (move the pointer on the fonts button, and don't click, just use the wheel button).
Size
This control sets the size of the font in any of several selectable units.
Use editor
Use an external editor window for text editing instead of direct-on-canvas editing.
Antialiasing
Antialiasing will render the text with much smoother edges and curves. This is achieved by slight blurring and merging of the edges. This option can radically improve the visual appearance of the rendered typeface. Caution should be exercised when using antialiasing on images that are not in RGB color space.
Hinting
Uses the index of adjustment of the font to modify characters in order to produce clear letters in small font sizes.
Color
Color of the text that will be drawn next. Defaults to black. Selectable from the color picker dialog box that opens when the current color sample is clicked.
You can also click-and-drag the color from the Toolbox color area onto the text.
Justify
Causes the text to be justified according to any of four rules selectable from the associated icons.
Indent
Controls the indent spacing from the left margin, for the first line.
Line Spacing
Line spacing
Controls the spacing between successive lines of text. This setting is interactive: it appears at the same time in image text. The number is not the space between lines itself, but how many pixels must be added to or subtracted from this space (the value can be negative).
Letter Spacing
Controls the spacing between letters. Also in this case the number is not the space itself between letters, but how many pixels must be added to or subtracted from this space (the value can be negative).

The Paths tool allows to create complex selections called Bézier Curves, a bit like Lasso but with all the adaptability of vectorial curves.

Move Mode

Polygonal
With this option, segments are linear only. Handles are not available and segments are not bent when moving them.
Create selection from path
This button allows creation of a selection that is based on the path in its present state. This selection is marked with the usual "marching ants". Note that the path is still present: current tool is still path tool and you can modify this path without modifying the selection that has become independent. If you change tool, the path becomes invisible, but it persists in Path Dialog and you can re-activate it.
If the path is not closed, GIMP will close it with a straight line.

Tool Options Dialog
The Tool Options dialog of the Airbrush tool.
If you have things set up like most people do, activating a tool causes its Tool Options dialog to appear below the Toolbox. If you don't have things set up this way, you probably should: it is very difficult to use tools effectively without being able to manipulate their options.
The Tool Options appear beneath the Toolbox in the default setup. If you lose it somehow, you can get it back by creating a new Tool Options dialog using
Each tool has its own specific set of options. The choices you make for them are kept throughout the session, until you change them. In fact, the tool options are maintained from session to session. The persistence of tool options across sessions can sometimes be an annoying nuisance: a tool behaves very strangely, and you can't figure out why until you remember that you were using some unusual option the last time you worked with it, two weeks ago.
At the bottom of the Tool Options dialog, four buttons appear:
Save Options to
This button allows you to save the settings for the current tool, so that you can restore them later. It brings up the
Restore Options
This button allows you to restore a previously saved preset of options for the active tool. If no presets have ever been saved for the active tool, the button will be insensitive. Otherwise, clicking it will bring up a menu showing the names of all saved option sets: choosing a menu entry will apply those settings.
Delete Options
This button allows you to delete a previously saved set of options for the active tool. If no option-sets have ever been saved for the active tool, the button will simply repeat the tool name. Otherwise, clicking it will bring up a menu showing the names of all saved presets: the selected preset will be deleted.
Reset Options
This button resets the options for the active tool to their default values.
New sliders
Sliders
Option sliders have changed with GIMP-2.8: it is not visible, but the slider area is now divided into upper and lower parts.
The new sliders of tool options dialogs
The upwards arrow pointer in the top half of the slider area
The horizontal two-way arrow pointer in the lower half of the slider area
In the top half of the slider area:
Clicking with the up arrow pointer sets slider to a value that depends on the position of the pointer (no reference, imprecise). Clicking and dragging the up arrow pointer sets the value by large amounts.
In the lower half of the slider area:
Clicking with the two-way arrow pointer has no effect. Clicking and dragging the two-way arrow pointer sets the value by small amounts.
Once you have set the value approximately, you can tune it precisely using the two small arrow buttons at the right of the slider.
The value area in the slider area works as a text editor: there, you can edit the value or enter a new value directly.
For some options, you can drag the pointer outside the tool dialog. For example with the size slider, whose maximum value is 10,000, you can drag the mouse pointer up to the right side of your screen.
