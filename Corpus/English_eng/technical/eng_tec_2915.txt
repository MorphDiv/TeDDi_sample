(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Identical to fgets(), except that fgetss attempts to strip any HTML and PHP tags from the text it reads.
You can use the optional third parameter to specify tags which should not be stripped.
Note:
If you are having problems with PHP not recognizing the line endings when reading files either on or created by a Macintosh computer, you might want to enable the auto_detect_line_endings run-time configuration option.
See also fgets(), fopen(), fsockopen(), popen(), and strip_tags().
