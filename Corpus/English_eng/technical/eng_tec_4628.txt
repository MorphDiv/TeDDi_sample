(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.
Returns the number of bytes read from the file.
If an error occurs, FALSE is returned and unless the function was called as @readfile, an error message is printed.
Tip:
You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled.
See fopen() for more details on how to specify the filename and Appendix I for a list of supported URL protocols.
You can use the optional second parameter and set it to "1", if you want to search for the file in the include_path, too.
See also fpassthru(), file(), fopen(), include(), require(), virtual() and Appendix I.
