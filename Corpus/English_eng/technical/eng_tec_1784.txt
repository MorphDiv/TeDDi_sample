Working with Limits
How can I define the limits in a Sum or Integral formula?
You want to insert a summation formula like &quot; summation of s^k from k = 0 to n &quot; at the cursor in a Writer text document.
Insert - Object - Formula
.
You will see the Math input window and the Formula Elements window.
If you don't see the Formula Elements window, you can enable it in the View menu.
Operators
icon.
Sum
icon.
Upper and Lower Limits
icon.
In the input window, the first placeholder or marker is selected, and you can start to enter the lower limit:
k = 0
Press F4 to advance to the next marker, and enter the upper limit:
n
Press F4 to advance to the next marker, and enter the summand:
s^k
Now the formula is complete.
Click within your text document outside the formula to leave the formula editor.
In the same way, you can enter an Integral formula with limits.
When you click an icon from the Formula Elements window, the assigned text command is inserted in the input window.
If you know the text commands, you can enter the commands directly in the input window.
Insert - Object - Formula
.
Click in the input window and enter the following line:
int from{a} to{b} f(x)`dx
Format
icon, then the
Small Gap
icon.
Format - Fonts
and select other fonts.
Click the
Default
button to use the new fonts as default from now on.
Format - Text Mode
to place the limits besides the Sum or Integral symbol, which reduces the line height.
