InStr function
InStr Function [Run-time]
Returns the position of a string within another string.
The Instr function returns the position at which the match was found.
If the string was not found, the function returns 0.
Syntax:
InStr ([Start As Long,] Text1 As String, Text2 As String[, Compare])
Return value:
Integer
Parameters:
Start:
A numerical expression that marks the position in a string where the search for the specified substring starts.
If you omit this parameter, the search starts at the first character of the string.
The maximum allowed value is 65535.
Text1:
The string expression that you want to search.
Text2:
The string expression that you want to search for.
Compare:
Optional numerical expression that defines the type of comparison.
The value of this parameter can be 0 or 1.
The default value of 1 specifies a text comparison that is not case-sensitive.
The value of 0 specifies a binary comparison that is case-sensitive.
To avoid a run-time error, do not set the Compare parameter if the first return parameter is omitted.
Example:
Sub ExamplePosition
Dim sInput As String
Dim iPos as Integer
sInput = &quot; Office &quot;
iPos = Instr(sInput, &quot; c &quot; )
print iPos
end sub
