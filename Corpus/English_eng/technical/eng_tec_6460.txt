Questions and Answers
How do I enter multiple authors?
Author names should be separated by a semi-colon, like so: Brian W. Kernighan; Dennis M. Ritchie. Do n't include the word "and" or anything similar, even if you have 20 authors. If you have the auto-format option checked, then the last name will automatically be shown first for each author.
Other properties which allow multiple values, like "genre" and "keywords", are entered in the same way, with a semi-colon (;) separating each value.
Can I modify what the printed page looks like?
Yes, most certainly. Find the file tellico-printing. xsl which should be in the $KDEDIR / share/ apps/ tellico/ directory. You can copy that to $KDEHOME / share/ apps/ tellico/ for personal modifications. You'll have to know xslt;, but modifying that file is how you change the printing layout. & HTML; is generated from the file, and the easiest way to change the appearance of the printout is to modify the & CSS; in the top portion.
Be aware that the tellico-printing. xsl references another file, tellico-common. xsl, that contains some common & xslt; templates. If you copy tellico-printing. xsl to $KDEHOME, you must either modify the & lt; xsl: importgt; element to point to the actual location of the tellico-common. xsl file or copy the common file as well.
How do I group by a property other than the ones listed in the toolbar?
To allow grouping by a field which does n't allow grouping by default, check the "Allow Grouping" box for that particular field in the "Collection Fields" dialog.
Why does all that gobbledy-gook show up when I run & appname;?
Stuff like: Tellico: :updateCollectionToolBar GroupView: :setGroupAttribute - author GroupView: :slotAddCollection QCheckBox: :property( "title") failed: property invalid or does not exist is debug info. At compile time, this can be stopped by compiling with the --disable-debug flag. You might also want to use --enable-final, too, which takes a bit more memory when compiling, but is more efficient when running the application.
The last message is slightly different, it just means your & Qt; installation was compiled with some debugging information.
Or, if & appname; is already installed, run kdebugdialog and make sure that "0 (generic)" is unchecked. That turns off debug messages from all generic & kde; apps & ie; those not distributed officially by & kde;.
How do I change which columns are shown?
Right-click on the header bar. You can also drag the headers to re-order the columns, and click on them to sort by that field.
How do I filter by something like the "Read" field?
Internally, the checkbox fields in & appname; are saved as "true", so if you'd like to filter to show only the science fiction books which you've not read, for example, then you have two rules. Make sure the "Match all of the following" button is checked. Set the first rule to have "Genre" "contains" "Science Fiction" (no quotes) and the second rule to have "Read" "does not contain" "true" (no quotes).
Also, the quick filter in the toolbar will match any field, and if there is a non-word character, the text is interpreted as a regular expression. So if you quickly want to filter your books to show those by Weber or Bujold, then type "weber|bujold" (no quotes) in the toolbar.
How do I add new entry templates?
Entry templates should be saved in $KDEHOME / share/ apps/ tellico/ entry-templates/ for access for a single user or $KDEDIR / share/ apps/ tellico/ entry-templates/ for access by everyone. Templates in $KDEHOME will override any files by the same name in $KDEDIRS. The entry templates can be set on a per collection-type basis in the settings dialog.
Templates for the Report Dialog are saved in $KDEHOME / share/ apps/ tellico/ report-templates/.
Compiling and installing went fine, but when & appname; starts up, the window is blank. What's wrong?
& kde; programs look for data in the locations defined in the $KDEDIRS environmental variable. If you install in / usr/ local for example, but $KDEDIRS is empty or just / usr, then & appname; wo n't be able to find the files it needs. This is particularly true for & SuSE;, for which you should compile with --prefix = / opt/ kde3. Alternatively, you could add a line to your. profile file to set $KDEDIRS. Check the documentation for your shell.
How do I export additional bibtex fields?
& appname; uses the bibtex property to know how to export bibtex fields. If you want to add additional fields to export, such as an abstract, open up the Collection Fields Dialog, and click the Set Properties button. Add a bibtex property with value abstract. Then, when you export to bibtex or bibtexml, that property will be used for the bibtex field name.
What happened to Bookcase?
Due to a trademark conflict, Bookcase was renamed Tellico in September 2004. Tellico 0.12 was then released, which was identical to Bookcase 0.11, except for the name change.
What does the name Tellico have to do with anything?
I thought about several other names, a few of which were connected with book collections. However, Tellico can handle more than just books, and besides, this is a hobby, so I chose a neat-sounding (to me) name, one taken from a town close to where I grew up.
What do you include those links to Amazon. com in the search results?
The terms of agreement for accessing the Amazon. com Web Services require all images pulled from the service to be linked back to Amazon. com, as well as an additional link. The Amazon. com associate's ID is necessarily included, so any referral payments are duly collected.
Why do n't you use a real database?
Part of the reason I started & appname; was to learn C++. I did n't know SQL at the time, and at the moment, I only have a faint knowledge of how to use it. Simply put, & appname; did n't start out as a relational database, and that wo n't change until sometime in the future when I get around to learning SQL and have the time and motivation to change the data model. If that bothers you, well, do n't use & appname; then.
Of course, anyone is welcome to make any changes they want to with the source code.
