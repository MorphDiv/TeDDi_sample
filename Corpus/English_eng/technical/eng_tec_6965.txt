On Edges
Because of displacement, a part of pixels are driven over the borders of layer or selection, and, on the opposite side, pixels places are emptying. Four following options allow you to fix this issue:

Dither Size
Once all pixels displaced, this option scatters them randomly, giving grain to the image. The higher this value (0.00-100.00), the thinner the grain.

Rotation Angle
This option sets displacement angle of pixels according to the slope direction of gradient. Previous examples have been created with a vertical gradient and a 90° angle: so, pixels were displaced horizontally and nothing went out of the image borders. Here is an example with a 10° angle and 6 iterations:
With a 10° angle and 6 iterations:
Displacement is made according to a 10° angle against vertical. Pixels going out the lower border on every iteration are going into through the upper border (Wrap option checked), giving a dotted line.

Displacement examples
The displacement map has four grey stripes with values of 210, 160, 110, and 60, respectively.
X displacement coefficient is 30. Vacated pixels are black. The image areas corresponding to light gray (128) were displaced 19 and 8 pixels to the left. The image areas corresponding to dark gray (127) were displaced 4 and 15 pixels to the right.

Edge Behavior
These options allows you to set displacement behaviour on active layer or selection edges:



Cartesian Displacement Mode
Displace filter options (Cartesian)
Displacement Mode: Cartesian
In both modes, direction and amount of displacement depend on the intensity of the corresponding pixel in the displacement map.
The map, that should be a grayscale image, has 256 gray levels (0-255), the (theoretical) average value is 127.5. The filter displaces image pixels corresponding to pixels with values less than 127.5 (0 to 127) in map to one direction, corresponding to pixels with values from 128 to 255 to the opposite direction.
X/Y Displacements
If the respective option is activated, image pixels corresponding to pixels from 0 to 127 will be displaced to the right for X, downwards for Y, image pixels corresponding to pixels from 128 to 255 will be displaced to the left for X, upwards for Y.
Scaled intensity = (intensity - 127.5) / 127.5; see
What you enter in input boxes, directly or by using arrow-head buttons, is not the actual displacement. It's a coefficient used in a
This value may be positive or negative. A negative displacement is reverse of a positive one. The value varies in limits equal to the double of image dimensions.
When you click on the drop-down list button, a list appears where you can select a displacement map. To be present in this list, an image must respect two conditions. First, this image must be present on your screen when you call filter. Then, this image must have the same dimensions as the original image. Most often, it will be a duplicate original image, which is transformed to grey scale and modified appropriately, with a gradient. It may be possible to use RGB images, but color luminosity is used making result prevision difficult. Map may be different in horizontal and vertical directions.

Displacement Calculation
The following section will show you how to calculate the amount of displacement, if you are interested in these details. If you don't want to know it, you can safely omit this section.
The overview example showed the X displacement using a coefficient of 30.0: 19, 8, 4, or 15 pixels, depending on the grey level of the displacement map's color.
Why just these amounts? That's easy:
$30.0 * \\frac{I - 127.5}{127.5} = D$
$30.0 * \\frac{210 - 127.5}{127.5} = 19$
$30.0 * \\frac{(160 - 127.5)}{127.5} = 8$
$30.0 * \\frac{(110 - 127.5)}{127.5} = -4$
$30.0 * \\frac{(60 - 127.5)}{127.5} = -15$
If you check these equations, you will notice that the values they give are not exactly the results we retained in the example (using non-integers, that's not surprising). So, were the results rounded to the nearest integer and then the pixels were displaced by a whole-numbered amount? No. Every pixel is displaced exactly by the calculated amount; a
A closer look at the displacement example
A small area zoomed in by 800 percent.
The displacement causes small (one pixel wide) areas of intermediate colors at the edges of plain color areas. E.g., the black area (zoomed in image) is caused by a displacement of -4.12, so the intermediate color is 12% black and 88% gold.
So if you select a displacement coefficient of 30.01 instead of 30.00, you will indeed get a different image, although you won't see the difference, of course.

This filter is found in the image window menu under

Parameter setting results are interactively displayed in preview. Scroll bars allow you to move around the image.
This drop-down list allows you to select the image that will be used as a map for bump-mapping. This list contains images that are present on your screen when you launch the filter. Images opened after starting filter are not present in this list.
Map Type
This option allows you to define the method that will be used when creating the map image:



Compensate for darkening
Bump-mapping tends to darken image. You can compensate this darkening by checking this option.
Invert bump-map
Bright pixels default to bumps and dark pixels to hollows. You can invert this effect by checking this option.
Tile bump-map
If you check this option, there will be no relief break if you use your image as a pattern for a web page: patterns will be placed side by side without any visible joins.
Azimut
This is about lighting according to the points of the compass (0 - 360). East (0°) is on the left. Increasing value goes counter-clockwise.
Elevation
That's height from horizon (0.50°), up to zenith (90°).
Depth
With this slider, you can vary bump height and hollow depth. The higher the value, the higher the difference between both. Values vary from 1 to 65.
X/Y offsets
With this slider, you can adjust the map image position compared with the image, horizontally (X) and/or vertically (Y).
Sea Level
If your image has transparent areas, they will be treated like dark areas and will appear as hollows after bump-mapping. With this slider, you can reduce hollows as if sea level was raising. This hollows will disappear when sea level value reaches 255. If the Invert bump-map option is checked, transparent areas will be treated as bright areas, and then Sea Level slider will plane bumps down.
Ambient
This slider controls the intensity of ambient light. With high values, shadows will fade and relief lessen.
