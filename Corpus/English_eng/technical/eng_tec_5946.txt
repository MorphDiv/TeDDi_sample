& Background color:
Here you set the color in which the background of the chart is painted.
Background wallpaper:
You can select a background image from this list. Initially, the installed KDE wallpapers will be offered. If you do not find what you are looking for here, you can select any image file by clicking on the Browse button below.
None
& Browse...
Click this button to select a background image not yet present in the list above.
This area will always display the currently selected background image. Note that the image will be scaled and thus might have a different ratio than it originally had.
In this box, you can set various settings that control how the background image is displayed.
& Intensity in%:
Here you can select how much the image should be brightened up so that it does not disturb the selected area too much. Different images require different settings, but 25% is a good value to start with.
If you check this box, the selected image will be scaled to fit the total size of the selected area. Image ratio will be adjusted to match the area size and height if necessary.
If you check this box, the selected image will be centered over the selected area. If the image is larger then the area, you will only see the middle part of it.
