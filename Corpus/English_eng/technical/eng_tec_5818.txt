Selecting this option causes the taskbar to display a button that, when clicked, shows a list of all windows in a popup menu.
Show only minimized windows
Select this option if you want the taskbar to display only minimized windows. By default, this option is not selected and the taskbar will show all windows.
& Group similar tasks:
The taskbar can group similar windows into single buttons. When one of these window group buttons are clicked on a menu appears showing all the windows in that group. This can be especially useful with the Show all windows option. You can set the taskbar to Never group windows, to Always group windows or to group windows only When the Taskbar is Full. By default the taskbar groups windows when it is full.
