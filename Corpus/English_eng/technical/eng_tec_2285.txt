Control Structures
Next
PHP offers an alternative syntax for some of its control structures; namely, if, while, for, foreach, and switch.
In each case, the basic form of the alternate syntax is to change the opening brace to a colon (:) and the closing brace to endif;, endwhile;, endfor;, endforeach;, or endswitch;, respectively.
?php if ($a == 5):?
A is equal to 5 ?php endif;?
In the above example, the HTML block "A is equal to 5" is nested within an if statement written in the alternative syntax.
The HTML block would be displayed only if $a is equal to 5.
The alternative syntax applies to else and elseif as well.
The following is an if structure with elseif and else in the alternative format:
if ($a == 5): print "a equals 5"; print ".. ."; elseif ($a == 6): print "a equals 6"; print "!! !"; else: print "a is neither 5 nor 6"; endif;
See also while, for, and if for further examples.
