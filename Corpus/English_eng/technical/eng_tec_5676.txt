Introduction

Playing & kappname;
Rules
Once a round is started, the players do not stop moving forward (unless the game is paused). All you have to do is avoid crashing by changing your players direction. Additionally you can try to hinder your opponent. For this it is possible to increase the velocity by pressing your accelerator key.
A round starts when all human players press a direction key. The initial moving direction is then in this direction.
If you want to interrupt playing, select Pause from the Game menu or hit the keyboard shortcut (see section Default Shortcuts). Additionally the game is paused when the game loses the keyboard focus, & eg; when switching to an other window.
To continue the game, select the menu item Pause again, or the keyboard shortcut. The game will also continue if the human players press one of their direction keys. But be careful, your player switches to this direction immediately.
A game consists of several rounds, and ends if a player has at least nine points, and additionally two more points than the opponent. The current score is always displayed in the status bar.
You can change the difficulty level of the game using the game menu item or the select box on the status bar. The difficulty influences the speed of the game and the computer player.
The Computer Player
You can play against a computer. The difficulty level of the game influences the intelligence of the computer player.
At low levels the computer does n't care about the opponent and just moves around. At higher skill levels the computer tries to hinder the opponent when he comes near.
Using the Keyboard
Each player has five keys. Four keys for changing the direction and one to accelerate.
The direction keys do not have to be held down. Simply press them once to change the direction of your player.
Acceleration only occurs while the acceleration key remains depressed. When you release the acceleration key, velocity returns to normal.
You can alter the keys using the shortcuts option in the Settings Menu.
Playing & ksnake;
Once the game is started, the player does not stop moving forward (unless the game is paused). All you have to do is avoid crashing by changing your direction. A game starts when you press a direction key. The initial moving direction is then in this direction.
If you want to pause playing, select Pause from the Game menu or hit the keyboard shortcut (see section Default Shortcuts). Additionally the game is paused when the game loses the keyboard focus, & eg; when switching to an other window.
To continue the game, select the menu item Pause or hit the keyboard shortcut again. The game will also continue if you press one of the direction keys. But be careful, your player switches to this direction immediately.
In the game there will always be a piece of fruit on the map. If you collect it your score will increase with 5 points. The current score is always displayed in the status bar.
When you are moving through the map there will appear obstacles. Hitting them will also result in a crash. However, every time an obstacle appears and you survive you'll be rewarded 2 points
You can change the difficulty level of the game using the game menu item or the select box on the status bar. The difficulty influences the speed of the game.
Using the keyboard
Each player has four keys. These are used for changing the direction. The direction keys do not have to be held down. Simply press them once to change the direction of your player.

Developer
The aim of the game is to live longer than your opponent. To do that, avoid running into a wall, your own tail and that of your opponent.
You can let the computer be Player One, Player Two or both players. There are three difficulty levels: Beginner, Average and Expert.
If you choose Beginner, the computer does n't care about the opponent and just moves around. This is the same algorithm as used by xtron-1.1.
See the Settings Menu section for information on how to configure the computer player.
Show winner by changing color
Enable this box to improve visualizing that the game is over by making & ktron; change the color of the loser's trail to the color of the winner.
Crash when moving in the opposite direction
Enable this to make a vehicle crash into itself as soon as a player attempts to move into the opposite direction (ie; a vehicle moves left, and the player tries to move to the right in one step). If this box is not checked, nothing happens when a player attempts to move into the opposite direction.
Speed
Use this slider to define how fast the vehicles move; moving the slider to the left will make the vehicles move slower, moving it to the right will make them move faster.
AI Configuration
Computer Controls
Use these two checkable boxes to define which players should be controlled by the computer.
Intelligence:
Selects the skill level of the computer player, Beginner, Average or Expert
Beginner ignores the opponent, and just moves randomly. Average or Expert causes the computer to actively hinder the opponent.
Appearance Configuration
Line style:
Here you can choose one of four different line styles to be used for drawing the vehicles. The names of the styles are self-explanatory: 3D Line, 3D Rectangles, Flat and Circles.
Line Size
Use this slider to define how broad the trail of a vehicle should be. Moving the slider towards the left will make the trail more narrow, moving it to the right will result in a wider trail.
Background
Here you can define the appearance of the playground's background. If you prefer a simple solid color, select the Color: option and click on the button at the right of it to open a convenient color-selection dialog.
You can also choose a background image for the playground. To do so, select the Image: option, and then provide the filename of a wallpaper image to use in the input field at the right. Alternatively you can click on the little button at the very right to open the well-known file-selection dialog.
Player 1 color:
Click on the colored rectangle to open a color-selection dialog which lets you define the color to be used for the vehicle of the first player.
Player 2 color:
Click on the colored rectangle to open a color-selection dialog which lets you define the color to be used for the vehicle of the second player.
