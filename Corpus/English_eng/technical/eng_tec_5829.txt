KrViewer: & krusader; 's internal viewer-editor
Viewer
Editor
Pressing & Enter; on a selected file opens the file with the associated application. The editor-viewer is tabbed, configure it on the Konfigurator General page
Viewer
To view a file as fast as possible according to its type, just put it under the cursor and press F3. & krusader; 's internal viewer is actually a part of & konqueror;, which can basically view every file type viewable by & konqueror; (eg; display pictures, play music, show the content of an archive). This is called the'Generic viewer ', for which you need to configure the mime types.
The viewer works as follows: It tries to view the file with the'Generic viewer '. When the file type (mime type) cannot be determined or when a file (eg; a binary) does n't have an associated action, it disables the'generic viewer'. The file is treated as a text file, which is the'Text viewer '. The user can change in the KrViewer menu between: 'Generic viewer' (if available), 'Text viewer 'and'Hex viewer'. You can configure the default viewer mode on the Konfigurator General page.
Shift; F3 views a & URL; on demand, & eg;:
man: / views the manpages.
man: / krusader views a manpage.
info: / views the infopages.
http: / / krusader. sourceforce. net/ views a webpage.
ftp: / / ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde/ views a ftp-server.
sftp: / / sftp. foo/ views a secure ftp-server.
file: / home/ frank views the homedirectory of Frank.
/ home/ frank/ archive. tar. gz views a tar. gz archive.
KrViewer can have the following menus: File, Edit, View, Settings and Krviewer, depending on which file type is viewed. They will be discussed in the Editor section. The internal viewer can follow links on & HTML; pages. With Ctrl; E the viewer can start & krusader; 's internal editor (which is basically the same application).
The embedded viewer is not written by us, it is supplied via & kde; (libs) and KIO Slaves. We cannot and do not want to change it, usings these libraries reduces the amount of written code. So we do not have to reinvent the wheel; -)
Editor
Editor
& krusader; 's internal editor has almost everything that you can expect of an editor. Editing is similar to viewing but with the F4 key. The default editor is & krusader; 's internal editor. You can change the default editor in the Konfigurator General page, if you prefer to use an external editor.
When you use & krusader; 's internal editor for the first time, it is recommended to look at each section of the Settings menu, and configure it the way you want it.
