EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
EPOETIN ALFA HEXAL
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Epoetin Alfa Hexal?
Epoetin Alfa Hexal is a solution for injection.
It is available in pre-filled syringes containing between 1,000 and 10,000 international units (IU) of the active substance, epoetin alfa.
Epoetin Alfa Hexal is a ‘ biosimilar’ medicine.
This means that Epoetin Alfa Hexal is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active substance (also known as the ‘ reference medicine’).
The reference medicine for Epoetin Alfa Hexal is Eprex/ Erypo.
For more information on biosimilar medicines, see the question-and-answer document here.
What is Epoetin Alfa Hexal used for?
Epoetin Alfa Hexal is used in the following situations: • to treat anaemia (low red blood cell counts) that is causing symptoms in patients with ‘ chronic renal failure’ (long-term, progressive decrease in the ability of the kidneys to work properly) or other kidney problems; • to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for certain types of cancer and to reduce the need for blood transfusions; • to increase the amount of blood that can be taken in adult patients with moderate anaemia who are going to have an operation and donate their own blood before surgery (autologous blood transfusion); • to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adults with mild anaemia who are about to undergo major orthopaedic (bone) surgery, such as hip surgery.
It is used in patients with normal blood iron levels who could experience complications if they were to receive a blood transfusion, if they do not have the opportunity to donate their own blood before surgery and are expected to lose 900 to 1,800 ml of blood.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Epoetin Alfa Hexal used?
Treatment with Epoetin Alfa Hexal must be started under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with the conditions that the medicine is used for.
For patients with kidney problems and patients who are going to donate their own blood, Epoetin Alfa Hexal must be injected into a vein.
Patients receiving chemotherapy or about to undergo orthopaedic

Epoetin Alfa Hexal can be injected under the skin by the patient or their carer if they have been trained appropriately.
The dose, the frequency of injection and how long it is used for depend on why Epoetin Alfa Hexal is being used, and are adjusted according to the patient’ s response.
For patients with chronic renal failure or receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin levels should remain within the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilitre in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl in children).
Haemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body.
For these patients, the lowest does that provides adequate control of symptoms should be used.
The iron levels of all patients should be checked before treatment to make sure that they are not too low, and iron supplements should be used throughout treatment.
For full details, see the Package Leaflet.
How does Epoetin Alfa Hexal work?
A hormone called erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cells from the bone marrow.
Erythropoietin is produced by the kidneys.
In patients receiving chemotherapy or with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a lack of erythropoietin, or by the body not responding enough to the erythropoietin it has naturally.
In these cases, erythropoietin is used to replace the missing hormone or to increase red blood cell counts.
Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and help minimise the consequences of blood loss.
The active substance in Epoetin Alfa Hexal, epoetin alfa, is a copy of human erythropoietin and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone to stimulate red blood cell production.
The epoetin alfa in Epoetin Alfa Hexal is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce epoetin alfa.
How has Epoetin Alfa Hexal been studied?
Epoetin Alfa Hexal was studied to show that it is comparable with the reference medicine, Eprex/ Erypo, in experimental models and in humans.
Epoetin Alfa Hexal, injected into a vein, was compared with the reference medicine in one main study involving 479 patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems.
All of the patients had been taking Eprex/ Erypo injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Epoetin Alfa Hexal or remained on Eprex/ Erypo.
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the levels of haemoglobin between the start of the study and the evaluation period, between weeks 25 and 29.
The company also presented the results of a study comparing the effects of Epoetin Alfa Hexal injected under the skin with those of Eprex/ Erypo in 114 cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy.
What benefit has Epoetin Alfa Hexal shown during the studies?
Epoetin Alfa Hexal was as effective as Eprex/ Erypo in increasing and maintaining red blood cell counts.
In the study of patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems, patients switching to Epoetin Alfa Hexal maintained haemoglobin levels to the same extent as those continuing to take Eprex/ Erypo.
On average, the levels of the patients taking Epoetin Alfa Hexal increased by 0.147 g/ dl from a starting value of 11.7 g/ dl.
In comparison, those continuing to take Eprex/ Erypo had an increase of 0.063 g/ dl from a starting value of 12.0 g/ dl.
The study in patients receiving chemotherapy showed that Epoetin Alfa Hexal was also as effective as Eprex/ Erypo when it was injected under the skin.
What is the risk associated with Epoetin Alfa Hexal?
The most common side effect with Epoetin Alfa Hexal is an increase in blood pressure, which can sometimes lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stabbing migraine- like headache and confusion.
Epoetin Alfa Hexal can also lead to skin rash and flu-like symptoms.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Epoetin Alfa Hexal, see the Package Leaflet.
Epoetin Alfa Hexal should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.
It must not be used in the following groups:
2/ 3 • patients who have developed pure red cell aplasia (reduced or stopped red blood cell production) following treatment with any erythropoietin; • patients with high blood pressure that is not controlled; • patients who are going to donate their own blood who have had a heart attack of stroke within the last month, who have angina pectoris (a severe type of chest pain) or who are at risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT: formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the body, usually in the leg); • patients who cannot receive medicines for the prevention of blood clots; • patients about to undergo major orthopaedic surgery who have severe cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) problems including a recent heart attack or stroke.
Epoetin Alfa Hexal is not recommended for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are needed to make sure that this does not cause allergic reactions.
Why has Epoetin Alfa Hexal been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that, in accordance with EU requirements, Epoetin Alfa Hexal has been shown to have a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile to Eprex/ Erypo.
Therefore, the CHMP’ s view was that, as for Eprex/ Erypo, the benefit outweighs the identified risks.
The Committee recommended that Epoetin Alfa Hexal be given marketing authorisation.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Epoetin Alfa Hexal?
The company that makes Epoetin Alfa Hexal will provide information packs for healthcare workers in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.
The company will also provide cool boxes for patients, which will include illustrations showing how the medicine should be used.
