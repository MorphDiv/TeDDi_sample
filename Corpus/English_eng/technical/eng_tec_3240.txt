(PHP 3 = 3.0.7, PHP 4)
Fetches a row as a pseudo-object from a result_id obtained either by ibase_query() or ibase_execute().
php $dbh = ibase_connect ($host, $username, $password); $stmt = 'SELECT * FROM tblname'; $sth = ibase_query ($dbh, $stmt); while ($row = ibase_fetch_object ($sth)) {print $row - email. "\n";} ibase_close ($dbh);?
Subsequent call to ibase_fetch_object() would return the next row in the result set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
See also ibase_fetch_row().
