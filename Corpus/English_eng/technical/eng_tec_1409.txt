Rotate
Rotates or skews the selected 2-D object(s) around a pivot point.
Drag a corner handle of the object in the direction you want to rotate it.
To skew an object, drag a centre handle in the direction you want to skew it.
Each slide has only one pivot point.
Double-click an object to move the pivot point to the centre of the object.
You can also drag the pivot point to a new location on the screen, and then rotate the object.
If you select a group that includes a 3-D object, only the 3-D object is rotated.
You cannot skew a 3-D object, instead, you can rotate it about the x- and y-axes by dragging the centre handles.
Icon
Rotate
Flip
Flips the selected object(s) around a flip line, that you can drag to anywhere on the slide.
Drag a handle of the object(s) across the flip line to flip the object(s).
To change the orientation of the flip line, drag one of its end points to new location.
Icon
Flip
In 3-D Rotation Object
Converts the selected 2-D object(s) to a 3-D object, by rotating the object(s) around a symmetry line.
Drag the symmetry line to a new location to change the shape of the converted object.
To change the orientation of the symmetry line, drag one of its end points.
Click the object to convert it to 3-D.
Icon

Set in circle (perspective)
Distorts the selected object by wrapping it around imaginary circles, and then adding perspective.
Drag a handle of the selected object to distort it.
If the selected object is not a polygon or Bézier curve, you are prompted to change the object to a curve before you can distort it.
Icon
Set in circle (perspective)
Set to circle (slant)
Distorts the selected object by wrapping it around imaginary circles.
Drag a handle of the selected object to distort it.
If the selected object is not a polygon or Bézier curve, you are prompted to change the object to a curve before you can distort it.
Icon
Set to circle (slant)
Distort
Lets you drag the handles of the selected object to change its shape.
If the selected object is not a polygon or Bézier curve, you are prompted to change the object to a curve before you can distort it.
Icon
Distort
Transparency
Applies a transparency gradient to the selected object.
The transparency line represents a a greyscale, with the black handle corresponding to 0% transparency and the white handle to 100% transparency.
Colour
Bar to change their greyscale values.
