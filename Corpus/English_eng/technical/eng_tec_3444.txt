PHP Manual

(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a string containing a string representation of all the array elements in the same order, with the glue string between each element.
Example 1. implode() example
?php $array = array( 'lastname', 'email', 'phone'); $comma_separated = implode(" ,", $array); print $comma_separated; / / lastname,email,phone?
For consistency with explode(), however, it may be less confusing to use the documented order of arguments.
See also explode(), and split().
