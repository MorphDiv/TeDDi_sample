(PHP 4 = 4.2.0)
Returns the floating point remainder of dividing the dividend (x) by the divisor (y).
The reminder (r) is defined as: x = i * y + r, for some integer i.
If y is non-zero, r has the same sign as x and a magnitude less than the magnitude of y.
Example 1.
Using fmod()
$x = 5.7; $y = 1.3; $r = fmod($x, $y); / / $r equals 0.5, because 4 * 1.3 + 0.5 = 5.7
