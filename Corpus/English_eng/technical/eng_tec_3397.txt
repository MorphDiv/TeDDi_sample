(PHP 3 = 3.0.3, PHP 4)
This function causes a fetch of the complete, unfiltered RFC2822 format header of the specified message as a text string and returns that text string.
The options are:
FT_UID The msgno argument is a UID FT_INTERNAL The return string is in "internal" format, without any attempt to canonicalize to CRLF newlines FT_PREFETCHTEXT The RFC822.TEXT should be pre-fetched at theFT_UID The msgno argument is a UID FT_INTERNAL The return string is in "internal "format, without any attempt to canonicalize to CRLF newlines FT_PREFETCHTEXT The RFC822.TEXT should be pre-fetched at the same time.
This avoids an extra RTT on an IMAP connection if a full message text is desired (e.g. in a "save to local file "operation)
