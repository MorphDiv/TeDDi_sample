imagecreatefromgif() returns an image identifier representing the image obtained from the given filename.
imagecreatefromgif() returns an empty string on failure.
It also outputs an error message, which unfortunately displays as a broken link in a browser.
To ease debugging the following example will produce an error GIF:
Example 1.
Example to handle an error during creation (courtesy vic@zymsys.com)
function LoadGif ($imgname) {$im = @imagecreatefromgif ($imgname); / * Attempt to open * / if (!$im) {/ * See if it failed * / $im = imagecreate (150, 30); / * Create a blank image * / $bgc = imagecolorallocate ($im, 255, 255, 255); $tc = imagecolorallocate ($im, 0, 0, 0); imagefilledrectangle ($im, 0, 0, 150, 30, $bgc); / * Output an errmsg * / imagestring ($im, 1, 5, 5, "Error loading $imgname", $tc);} return $im;}
Note:
Since all GIF support was removed from the GD library in version 1.6, this function is not available if you are using that version of the GD library.
Tip:
You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled.
See fopen() for more details on how to specify the filename and Appendix I for a list of supported URL protocols.
Warning
Windows versions of PHP prior to PHP 4.3 do not support accessing remote files via this function, even if allow_url_fopen is enabled.
