EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
INVIRASE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Invirase?
Invirase is a medicine containing the active substance saquinavir.
It is available as brown and green capsules (200 mg) and orange, oval tablets (500 mg).
What is Invirase used for?
Invirase is an antiviral medicine.
It is used to treat adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Invirase is always used in combination with ritonavir (another antiviral medicine) and other antiviral medicines.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Invirase used?
Treatment with Invirase should be started by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of HIV infection.
The recommended dose of Invirase for adults and adolescents over 16 years of age is 1,000 mg twice a day with 100 mg ritonavir, with or after food.
Invirase should be used with caution in patients who have severe problems with their kidneys or moderate problems with their liver.
It should not be used in patients who have severe liver problems.
How does Invirase work?
The active substance in Invirase, saquinavir, is a protease inhibitor.
It blocks an enzyme called protease, which is involved in the reproduction of HIV.
When the enzyme is blocked, the virus does not reproduce normally, slowing down the spread of infection.
Ritonavir is another protease inhibitor that is used as a ‘ booster’.
It slows down the rate at which saquinavir is broken down, increasing the levels of saquinavir in the blood.
This allows a lower dose of saquinavir to be used for the same antiviral effect.
Invirase, taken in combination with other antiviral medicines, reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.
Invirase does not cure HIV infection or AIDS, but it may delay the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.
How has Invirase been studied?
Invirase was assessed in six main studies involving 1,576 patients.
The first four studies assessed the medicine’ s effects without ritonavir.
The combination of Invirase with ritonavir was assessed in 656 patients in two studies that compared Invirase with indinavir and with lopinavir (other antiviral 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

These studies measured the number of patients in whom treatment had stopped working after 48 weeks, as determined by a rise in the level of HIV in the blood (viral load).
What benefit has Invirase shown during the studies?
Invirase, taken in combination with other antiviral medicines, resulted in falls in viral loads and improvements in the immune system.
In the studies of Invirase in combination with ritonavir, Invirase led to similar rates of treatment failure to indinavir, but higher rates than lopinavir.
This was mainly caused by more patients stopping Invirase treatment rather than by any differences in the effectiveness of the medicines.
What is the risk associated with Invirase?
The most common side effects when taking Invirase in combination with ritonavir (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), increased levels of liver enzymes, cholesterol and triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood, and decreased levels of platelets in the blood (components that help blood to clot).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Invirase, see the Package Leaflet.
Invirase should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to saquinavir or any of the other ingredients.
It must not be used in patients who have severe problems with their liver or who are taking any of the following medicines: • terfenadine, astemizole (commonly used to treat allergy symptoms - these medicines may be available without prescription); • pimozide (used to treat mental illness); • cisapride (used to relieve certain stomach problems); • amiodarone, propafenone, flecainide (used to correct irregular heartbeat); • triazolam, oral (taken by mouth) midazolam (used to relieve anxiety or difficulty sleeping); • simvastatin, lovastatin (used to lower cholesterol); • ergot alkaloids, such as ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine and methylergonovine (used to treat migraine headache); • rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis); • medicines that may interact with Invirase and cause harmful side effects.
Caution is needed when Invirase is taken at the same time as other medicines.
See the Package Leaflet for full details.
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Invirase may be at risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).
Patients who have problems with their liver (including hepatitis B or C infection) may be at an elevated risk of liver damage when taking Invirase.
Why has Invirase been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Invirase’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adult patients in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products.
The Committee recommended that Invirase be given marketing authorisation.
Invirase was originally authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’, because, for scientific reasons, limited information was available at the time of approval.
As the company had supplied the additional information requested, the ‘ Exceptional Circumstances ’ ended on 8 April 1999.
Other information about Invirase:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Invirase to Roche Registration Limited on 4 October 1996.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 4 October 2001 and on 4 October 2006.
