CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor Manual
CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor shows the current clock speed of the CPU and provides an interface to change the clock speed if the CPU supports it.

CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor Applet Manual V0.3
October 2004
Carlos Garcia Campos
This manual describes version 2.12.0 of CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor.
Feedback
To report a bug or make a suggestion regarding the CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor applet or this manual, follow the directions in the
CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor
Introduction
The
To add
Unfortunately, CPU frequency scaling can currently only be monitored on Linux machines that have support in the kernel. It can however, support the several generations of frequency scaling interfaces in the kernel.
When there is no CPU frequency scaling support in the system, the CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor only displays the current CPU frequency.
When CPU frequency scaling is supported in the system, the CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor displays the CPU icon with a progress bar. The state of the progress bar represents the current CPU frequency with respect to the maximum frequency.
By default the CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor displays the current CPU frequency as a value in Hertz (the standard measure of frequency), but can be configured to display a percentage instead. For more information on how to configure CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor see
Each instance of CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor can monitor only one CPU. You must start an instance of CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor for each CPU that you want to monitor if you are in a multiprocessor (SMP) system.
Understanding the Icons
The CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor has a series of icons that graphically represent the current scaling level of the processor you are monitoring. They are:
Icon
Description
100% Power
The CPU is running at, or close to, 100% throughput
75% Power
The CPU is running at, or close to, 75% throughput
50% Power
The CPU is running at, or close to, 50% throughput
25% Power
The CPU is running at, or close to, 25% throughput
Frequency and Governor Selector
The Frequency Selector functionality may not be available on your GNOME Desktop by default. Please consult your system administrator, vendor documentation, or the documentation that came with this software.
To set the CPU frequency, (left-)click on the monitor and a menu will be shown. This menu will offer you a list of available frequencies and/or frequency governors for your machine.
You can choose whether you want to show available frequencies or governors in the
Frequency selector showing just frequencies
