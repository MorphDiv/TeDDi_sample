Rule:
Put here a description of your filtering rule. If you leave the field empty a description will be automatically generated.
A filter is composed of a sequence of rules. Each rule contains a condition and a sequence of actions. If the condition matches then the actions are executed one after another. If a terminal action is encountered then filter application terminates. If the condition does not match, or no terminal action is executed, then control is given to the next rule. Now click "Add Rule" above to start editing the filter.
Do you really want to delete the specified rule?
