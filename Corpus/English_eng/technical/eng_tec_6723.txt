Tiles three and four will be repeated over the game board and top row unless a full window background image is specified in the theme file.
TIP
PNG format is recommended for tile sets. The first, second, fifth and sixth tiles should contain some transparency if you want the background to show through. The third and fourth tiles should be solid, with no transparency, even if you'll be using a full window background image with your theme.
Tiles can be square or rectangular, and any size you like. Most of the tile sets that come with
For a full window background image, there's a bit more work to do. Let's say your tiles measure 50 by 50 pixels each. The game's display measures 7 by 7 tiles, including the top row, so the ideal background image for your tile set measures 350 by 350 pixels.

So, you now have a tile set and perhaps a background image to go with it. The next step is to put them in the right place.

Connecting to a Four-in-a-Row network server
The Four-in-a-Row connection dialog is shown initially when starting a new network game. This dialog allows you to select a server to connect to, and the username that you will have while connected to that server.
It is possible to connect to a server with either a guest account or a normal registered account. Guest accounts allows you to anonymously login, while a normal login account allows you to reserve your own username which is protected by the password that you choose.

To connect to a server, click on the
The Four-in-a-Row network connection dialog.
Joining a game room
Once you have successfully connected to a server, you can choose which game room to join. To play a multiplayer game of Four-in-a-Row, select the Four-in-a-Row room. If you want to host your own game, then click on the Launch button. This creates a new table where other players can participate in a game against you. If there are any other games already started, then you can double-click on an existing game table to join it. The list of game tables on the right shows you the number of available seats, which means the number of players that can join the game table.
This Four-in-a-Row network dialog allows you to join a game room to find other players.
When creating a new table for Four-in-a-Row games, a preference dialog is displayed which allows you to customize the game, such as set the minimum number of players for the game. Once the total number of seats have been taken, then no more players are allowed to join that game table.
It is possible to chat with other players in network games. Ask for advice or help playing the games, but please be polite against other players.
Waiting for other players to join the game
Once you have successfully joined a game table, then you have to wait until enough players have joined the table. The
Playing multiplayer Four-in-a-Row games
Multiplayer Four-in-a-Row games have pretty much the same rules as normal Four-in-a-Row games, except that you are now playing against human players. This means that other strategies might possibly be better than when playing against AI players.
Once a player has won, the game ends and you can return to the initial network game screen. Then you can play yet another game of addictive Four-in-a-Row multiplayer!
Known Bugs and Limitations
Occasionally a marble-dropping animation doesn't look as smooth as it should.
