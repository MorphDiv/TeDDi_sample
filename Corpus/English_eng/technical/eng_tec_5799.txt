Before starting the upgrade, you can choose which packages will be kept. Shaman already found the best solution for your system, but you can review the selection and make some additional changes. Note that you are also able to add new packages during the upgrade.

The upgrade has been completed successfully. It is strongly advised to reboot as soon as possible, since your system might be unstable until then. Do you want to do it now?
Force
Processes the queue regardless of errors and file conflicts. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Ignore dependencies
Skips all dependency checks. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Ignore backups
Ignores file backup designations when removing packages, which means. pacsave files will not be generated.
Cascade
When removing packages, removes also all packages that depend on one or more target packages. This operation is recursive, and must be used with care since it can remove many potentially needed packages.
Recursive removal
When removing packages, removes also all of their dependencies, provided that they are not required by other packages and they were not explicitly installed by the user. This option helps keeping a clean system without orphans.
Complete recursive removal
When removing packages, removes also all of their dependencies, provided that they are not required by other packages.
Remove database entry only
When removing packages, removes only the entry from the database, but not the files. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Ignore package scriptlets
Ignores packages' scripts. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Download packages only
When installing or upgrading packages, downloads the package only without installing or upgrading it. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Install all packages as explicitly installed
When installing or upgrading packages, installs every package marking it as explicitly installed, even if it is a dependency. Enable only if you know what you are doing.
Install all packages as dependencies
When installing or upgrading packages, installs every package marking it as a dependency, even if it was explicitly selected. Enable only if you know what you are doing.

No further details were given. Last error string was: %1
Some files in the packages being processed are conflicting

Some files in the packages being processed conflict with the local filesystem

This is probably an internal Aqpm error. Please report it to help the developers solving it
It looks like the system policy prevents you from doing this action, or you failed or refused to authenticate. Please contact your system administrator for further details
Aqpm, the library underneath Shaman, reported that it could not start a privileged operation. This is probably due to a bug in Aqpm or to a misconfiguration of your system
It looks like Aqpm's worker crashed or disappeared. This is probably an internal Aqpm error. Please report it to help the developers solving it
