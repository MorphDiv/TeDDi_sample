A simple ball dodging game
How to play
Objective:
Let the blue ball move in the field without touching the red balls.
Click on the empty field to start a game: a blue ball immediately replaces your mouse cursor, and a number of red balls start to fade into the field.
When the red balls finish materializing, they move at a random speed in a random direction, and you have to promptly dodge them moving the blue ball inside the field with your mouse. After some time, other red balls will appear, fading in as before and then starting to move. Be prepared to avoid them, too.
You can choose the game difficulty level on the right of the status bar. The higher the difficulty level, the faster red balls move, and the more balls will appear on the play field.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Game Rules
Red balls move with constant speed on the game field bouncing off walls until colliding with another ball, which causes the speed and direction of both balls to change.
The blue ball can be freely moved inside the field with the mouse.
The blue ball cannot escape the field. If the cursor is moved out, the ball stays on the edge, until the cursor returns.
The score is directly proportional to the time the game has lasted.
Pausing the game subtracts a (cumulative) 5 seconds penalty from the total time.
Strategies and Tips
Move the blue ball gently and slowly. Swinging across the field will make collisions with other balls more likely.
Moving the cursor out of the field can be used as an elegant trick to come out of a screwed situation. Use it wisely.
Do not pause the game unless absolutely necessary.
