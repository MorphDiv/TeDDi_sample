Further information
1.
WHAT GONAL-f IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GONAL-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa, which is made in laboratories by special recombinant DNA techniques.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Therapeutic indications
The medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician.
• In women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate, GONAL-f can be used to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
• In women who are not ovulating due to very low production of the fertility hormones (FSH and LH) by their pituitary gland, GONAL-f is used together with another hormone called lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone) to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men, who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
171 Do not use GONAL-f
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f. • if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
If you are a woman:
• ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
• GONAL-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage.
In addition, no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Take special care with GONAL-f
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see Section 4).
However, if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
GONAL-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/ embryos replaced.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
Miscarriages are higher than in the normal population, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
172 GONAL-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection, except for lutropin alfa.
Studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together, without either product being adversely affected.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day.
This may be increased by 37.5 IU-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
173 Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at as lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means by injection just under the skin.
It is for single use only.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
• Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
• Assemble and lay out on a clean surface everything you need:
- - - - - -
one ampoule containing GONAL-f powder one solvent ampoule two alcohol swabs one syringe one needle for reconstitution and a fine bore needle for subcutaneous injection sharp container
• Open the ampoule of solvent (clear liquid):
On the head of the solvent ampoule, you will see a
174 small coloured dot.
Directly below it is where the neck of the ampoule has been treated to make it easier to break.
Gently flick the top section of the ampoule so that any fluid in the neck of the ampoule drops into the bottom chamber.
Now press the ampoule firmly over the neck, and break the ampoule away from the coloured dot.
Carefully place the open ampoule upright on the work surface.
• Draw up the solvent:
Attach the needle for reconstitution to the syringe, with the syringe in one hand, pick up the open ampoule, insert the needle and draw up all of the solvent.
Carefully set the syringe down on the work surface, taking care not to touch the needle.
• Open and prepare the injection solution:
Open the ampoule containing the GONAL-f powder, pick up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the ampoule of powder.
After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), gently draw the solution back into the syringe.
(If you have been prescribed more than one ampoule of GONAL-f, slowly re-inject the solution into another powder ampoule, until you have the prescribed number of powder ampoules dissolved in the solution.
If you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to GONAL-f, you may also mix the two medicines as an alternative to injecting each product separately.
After dissolving the lutropin alfa powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the ampoule containing GONAL-f.
Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe.
Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear.
Up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in the content of one ampoule of solvent.)
• Change the needle for the fine bore needle and remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
• Immediately inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e. g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the
175 skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
• Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and empty ampoules in the sharp container provided.
Any unused solution must be discarded.
If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see section 2) can occur.
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
In rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
In view of the above, to prevent such events, when the ovarian response is excessive, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Rarely abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa / hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
176 Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG.
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
5.
HOW TO STORE GONAL-f
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Do not store above 25°C.
Store in the original package in order to protect from light.
Do not use GONAL-f after the expiry date which is stated on the ampoule after EXP.
The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.
The medicine must be administered immediately after reconstitution.
Do not use GONAL-f if you notice any visible signs of deterioration.
The reconstituted solution should not be administered if it contains particles or is not clear.
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required.
These measures will help to protect the environment.

There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicule stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
182 GONAL-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection, except for lutropin alfa.
Studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together, without either product being adversely affected.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day.
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
183 Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
It is for single use only.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
• Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
• Assemble and lay out on a clean surface everything you need:
- - - - - -
one vial containing GONAL-f powder one solvent vial two alcohol swabs one syringe one needle for reconstitution and a fine bore needle for subcutaneous injection sharp container
184 • Remove the protective cap from the solvent vial.
Attach the reconstitution needle to the syringe and draw up some air into the syringe by pulling the plunger to approximately the 1 ml mark.
Then, insert the needle into the vial, push the plunger to expel the air, turn the vial upside down and gently draw up all the solvent.
Set the syringe down carefully on the work-surface taking care not to touch the needle.
• Prepare the injection solution:
Remove the protective cap from the GONAL-f powder vial, pick up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the vial of powder.
Swirl gently without removing the syringe.
Do not shake.
After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles.
Turn the vial upside down, gently draw the solution back into the syringe.
(If you have been prescribed more than one vial of GONAL-f, slowly re-inject the solution into another powder vial, until you have the prescribed number of powder vials dissolved in the solution.
If you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to GONAL-f, you may also mix the two medicines as an alternative to injecting each product separately.
After dissolving the lutropin alfa powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the vial containing GONAL-f.
Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe.
Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear.
Up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.)
• Change the needle for the fine bore needle and remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
• Immediately inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e. g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
• Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and empty glass containers in the sharp container provided.
Any unused solution must be discarded.
If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
185 If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see section 2) can occur.
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
In rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
In view of the above, to prevent such events, when the ovarian response is excessive, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Rarely abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa / hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG.
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

Further information
1.
WHAT GONAL-f IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GONAL-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa, which is made in laboratories by special recombinant DNA techniques.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Therapeutic indications
The medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician.
• In women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate, GONAL-f can be used to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
• In women who are not ovulating due to very low production of the fertility hormones (FSH and LH) by their pituitary gland, GONAL-f is used together with another hormone called lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone) to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men, who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
190 Do not use GONAL-f
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f. • if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
If you are a woman:
• ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
• GONAL-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage.
In addition, no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Take special care with GONAL-f
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see Section 4).
However, if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
GONAL-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/ embryos replaced.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
Miscarriages are higher than in the normal population, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
191 GONAL-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection, except for lutropin alfa.
Studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together, without either product being adversely affected.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day.
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
192 Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
It is for single use only.

Further information
1.
WHAT GONAL-f IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GONAL-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa, which is made in laboratories by special recombinant DNA techniques.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Therapeutic indications
The medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician.
• In women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate, GONAL-f can be used to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
• In women who are not ovulating due to very low production of the fertility hormones (FSH and LH) by their pituitary gland, GONAL-f is used together with another hormone called lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone) to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men, who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
199 Do not use GONAL-f
• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f. • If you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
If you are a woman:
• ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
• GONAL-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage.
In addition, no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Take special care with GONAL-f
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see Section 4).
However, if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
GONAL-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/ embryos replaced.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
Miscarriages are higher than in the normal population, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
200 GONAL-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection, except for lutropin alfa.
Studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together, without either product being adversely affected.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day.
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
201 Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
It is for single use only.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
• Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
• Assemble and lay out on a clean surface everything you need:
- - - - -
one vial containing GONAL-f powder one pre-filled syringe containing the solvent two alcohol swabs one needle for reconstitution and a fine bore needle for subcutaneous injection sharp container
• Prepare the injection solution:
Remove the protective caps from the GONAL-f vial and from
202 the solvent pre-filled syringe.
Attach the needle for reconstitution to the pre-filled syringe and slowly inject all the solvent into the vial of GONAL-f powder.
Swirl gently without removing the syringe.
Do not shake.
• After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles.
Turn the vial upside down, gently draw the solution back into the syringe.
(If you have been prescribed more than one vial of GONAL-f, slowly re-inject the solution into another powder vial, until you have the prescribed number of powder vials dissolved in the solution.
If you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to GONAL-f, you may also mix the two medicines as an alternative to injecting each product separately.
After dissolving the lutropin alfa powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the vial containing GONAL-f.
Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe.
Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear.
Up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.)
• Change the needle for the fine bore needle and remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
• Immediately inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e. g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
• Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and empty glass containers in the sharp container provided.
Any unused solution must be discarded.
203 If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see also section 2) can occur.
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
In rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
In view of the above, to prevent such events, when the ovarian response is excessive, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Rarely abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa / hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG.
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men, who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
208 Do not use GONAL-f
• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f. • If you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
If you are a woman:
• ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
• GONAL-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage.
In addition, no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Take special care with GONAL-f
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see Section 4).
However, if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
GONAL-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/ embryos replaced.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
Miscarriages are higher than in the normal population, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
209 GONAL-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection, except for lutropin alfa.
Studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together, without either product being adversely affected.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day.
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
210 Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
It is for single use only.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
• Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
• Assemble and lay out on a clean surface everything you need:
- - - - -
one vial containing GONAL-f powder one pre-filled syringe containing the solvent two alcohol swabs one needle for reconstitution and a fine bore needle for subcutaneous injection sharp container
211 • Prepare the injection solution:
Remove the protective caps from the GONAL-f vial and from the solvent pre-filled syringe.
Attach the needle for reconstitution to the pre-filled syringe and slowly inject all the solvent into the vial of GONAL-f powder.
Swirl gently without removing the syringe.
Do not shake.
• After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles.
Turn the vial upside down, gently draw the solution back into the syringe.
(If you have been prescribed more than one vial of GONAL-f, slowly re-inject the solution into another powder vial, until you have the prescribed number of powder vials dissolved in the solution.
If you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to GONAL-f, you may also mix the two medicines as an alternative to injecting each product separately.
After dissolving the lutropin alfa powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the vial containing GONAL-f.
Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe.
Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear.
Up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.)
• Change the needle for the fine bore needle and remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
• Immediately inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e. g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
• Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and empty glass containers in the sharp container provided.
Any unused solution must be discarded.
212 If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see section 2) can occur.
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
In rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
In view of the above, to prevent such events, when the ovarian response is excessive, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Rarely abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa / hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG.
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

Further information
1.
WHAT GONAL-f IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GONAL-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa, which is made in laboratories by special recombinant DNA techniques.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Therapeutic indications
The medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician.
• In women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate, GONAL-f can be used to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
• In women who are not ovulating due to very low production of the fertility hormones (FSH and LH) by their pituitary gland, GONAL-f is used together with another hormone called lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone) to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men, who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
217 Do not use GONAL-f
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f. • if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
If you are a woman:
• ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
GONAL-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage.
In addition, no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Take special care with GONAL-f
GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections.
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see Section 4).

218 Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
GONAL-f 1050 IU/ 1.75 ml (77 micrograms/ 1.75 ml) should not be mixed with other medicines in the same injection.
GONAL-f 1050 IU/ 1.75 ml (77 micrograms/ 1.75 ml) preparation is not to be mixed with other GONAL-f containers within the same vial or syringe.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day (0.13-0.25 ml).
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH (0.38 ml).
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU (0.25-0.38 ml) of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU (0.75 ml) daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
219 In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU (0.13-0.25 ml) of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU (0.25 ml) three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
Individual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only.
As this vial contains enough medication for several days of treatment, you need to make sure you only draw the amount of medication that was prescribed by your doctor.
The next injection should be done at the same time the next day.
Your doctor has prescribed you a dose of GONAL-f in IU.
You should use one of the 15 administration syringes graduated in FSH units provided.
1.
Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
2.
Assemble everything you need:
Find a clean area and lay out everything (two alcohol swabs, the 2 ml solvent pre-filled syringe, the vial containing GONAL-f and a syringe for administration).
See illustration.
220 3.
Prepare the injection solution:
You should have a 2 ml pre-filled syringe containing clear liquid (the solvent) and one vial containing GONAL-f (the white powder).
Remove the protective caps from the GONAL-f vial and from the solvent pre-filled syringe.
Pick up your pre-filled syringe of solvent and slowly inject all the solvent (2 ml) into the vial of GONAL-f powder.
Remove the syringe used for reconstitution from the vial and dispose of it.
This vial contains several doses of GONAL-f.
You will have to keep this vial several days and only draw the dose prescribed every day.
4.
Take the syringe for administration, fill it with air to the correct dose.
Shake gently the vial of GONAL-f with the solvent.
Insert the needle into the vial, turn the vial upside down, inject the air in the vial and draw the prescribed dose of GONAL-f into the syringe for administration.
5.
Remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
6.
Inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e. g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
7.
Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the syringes used safely, preferably in a sharp container.
For further injections with the reconstituted solution of GONAL-f, repeat steps 4. to 7.
221 8.
The reconstituted solution is for your use alone and should not be administered to other patients.
If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
Due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days.
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see section 2) can occur.
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
In rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
In view of the above, to prevent such events, when the ovarian response is excessive, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Rarely abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa/ hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG.
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

1.
WHAT GONAL-f IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GONAL-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa, which is made in laboratories by special recombinant DNA techniques.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Therapeutic indications
The medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician.
• In women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate, GONAL-f can be used to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
• In women who are not ovulating due to very low production of the fertility hormones (FSH and LH) by their pituitary gland, GONAL-f is used together with another hormone called lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone) to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men, who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
227 Do not use GONAL-f
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f. • if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
If you are a woman:
• ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
• GONAL-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage.
In addition, no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Take special care with GONAL-f
GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections.
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see Section 4).
However, if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
GONAL-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/ embryos replaced.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
Miscarriages are higher than in the normal population, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
228 Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
GONAL-f 450 IU/ 0.75 ml (33 micrograms/ 0.75 ml) should not be mixed with other medicines in the same injection.
GONAL-f 450 IU/ 0.75 ml (33 micrograms/ 0.75 ml) preparation is not to be mixed with other GONAL-f containers within the same vial or syringe.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day (0.13-0.25 ml).
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH (0.38 ml).
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU (0.25-0.38 ml) of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU (0.75 ml) daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
229 In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU (0.13-0.25 ml) of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU (0.25 ml) three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
Individual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only.
As this vial contains enough medication for several days of treatment, you need to make sure you only draw the amount of medication that was prescribed by your doctor.
The next injection should be done at the same time the next day.
Your doctor has prescribed you a dose of GONAL-f in IU.
You should use one of the 6 administration syringes graduated in FSH units provided.
1.
Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
2.
Assemble everything you need:
Find a clean area and lay out everything (two alcohol swabs, the 1 ml solvent pre-filled syringe, the vial containing GONAL-f and a syringe for administration).
230 See illustration.
3.
Prepare the injection solution:
You should have a 1 ml pre-filled syringe containing clear liquid (the solvent) and one vial containing GONAL-f (the white powder).
Remove the protective caps from the GONAL-f vial and from the solvent pre-filled syringe.
Pick up your pre-filled syringe of solvent and slowly inject all the solvent (1 ml) into the vial of GONAL-f powder.
Remove the syringe used for reconstitution from the vial and dispose of it.
This vial contains several doses of GONAL-f.
You will have to keep this vial several days and only draw the dose prescribed every day.
4.
Take the syringe for administration, fill it with air to the correct dose.
Shake gently the vial of GONAL-f with the solvent.
Insert the needle into the vial, turn the vial upside down, inject the air in the vial and draw the prescribed dose of GONAL-f into the syringe for administration.
5.
Remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
6.
Inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e. g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
231 7.
Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the syringes used safely, preferably in a sharp container.
For further injections with the reconstituted solution of GONAL-f, repeat steps 4. to 7.
8.
The reconstituted solution is for your use alone and should not be administered to other patients.
If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
If you forget to take GONAL-f

1.
WHAT GONAL-f IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GONAL-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa, which is made in laboratories by special recombinant DNA techniques.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Therapeutic indications
The medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician.
• In women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate, GONAL-f can be used to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
• In women who are not ovulating due to very low production of the fertility hormones (FSH and LH) by their pituitary gland, GONAL-f is used together with another hormone called lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone) to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men, who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
237 Do not use GONAL-f
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f. • if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
If you are a woman:
• ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
• GONAL-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage.
In addition, no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Take special care with GONAL-f
GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections.
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see Section 4).
However, if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
GONAL-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/ embryos replaced.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
Miscarriages are higher than in the normal population, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
238 Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
GONAL-f 300 IU/ 0.50 ml (22 micrograms/ 0.50 ml) should not be mixed with other medicines in the same injection.
GONAL-f 300 IU/ 0.50 ml (22 micrograms/ 0.50 ml) preparation is not to be mixed with other GONAL-f containers within the same vial or syringe.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day (0.13-0.25 ml).
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH (0.38 ml).
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU (0.25-0.38 ml) of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU (0.75 ml) daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
239 In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU (0.13-0.25 ml) of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU (0.25 ml) three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
Individual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only.
As this vial contains enough medication for several days of treatment, you need to make sure you only draw the amount of medication that was prescribed by your doctor.
The next injection should be done at the same time the next day.
Your doctor has prescribed you a dose of GONAL-f in IU.
You should use one of the 4 administration syringes graduated in FSH units provided.
1.
Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
2.
Assemble everything you need:
Find a clean area and lay out everything (two alcohol swabs, the pre-filled syringe, containing the solvent, the vial containing GONAL-f and a syringe for administration).
240 See illustration.
3.
Prepare the injection solution:
You should have a pre-filled syringe containing clear liquid (the solvent) and one vial containing GONAL-f (the white powder).
Remove the protective caps from the GONAL-f vial and from the solvent pre- filled syringe.
Pick up your pre-filled syringe of solvent and slowly inject all the solvent (0.75 ml) into the vial of GONAL-f powder.
Remove the syringe used for reconstitution from the vial and dispose of it.
This vial contains several doses of GONAL-f.
You will have to keep this vial several days and only draw the dose prescribed every day.
4.
Take the syringe for administration, fill it with air to the correct dose.
Shake gently the vial of GONAL-f with the solvent.
Insert the needle into the vial, turn the vial upside down, inject the air in the vial and draw the prescribed dose of GONAL-f into the syringe for administration.
5.
Remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
6.
Inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e. g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart- like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
241 7.
Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the syringes used safely, preferably in a sharp container.
For further injections with the reconstituted solution of GONAL-f, repeat steps 4. to 7.
8.
The reconstituted solution is for your use alone and should not be administered to other patients.
If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
Due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days.
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see also section 2”) can occur.
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
In rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
In view of the above, to prevent such events, when the ovarian response is excessive, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Rarely abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa/ hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG.
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain,
242 redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
5.
HOW TO STORE GONAL-f
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Prior to reconstitution, do not store above 25°C.
Store in the original package in order to protect from light.
Do not use GONAL-f after the expiry date which is stated on the vial label or carton after EXP.
The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.
Once the medicine is reconstituted (made up with the solvent), do not store above 25°C.
Do not freeze.
Store in the original container and use within 28 days.
Do not use GONAL-f if you notice any visible signs of deterioration.
The reconstituted solution should not be administered if it contains particles or is not clear.
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required.
These measures will help to protect the environment.

Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
248 Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce down regulation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day (0.12-0.24 ml).
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually lower than 225 IU FSH (0.36 ml).
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU (0.24-0.36 ml) of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU (0.72 ml) daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5000 IU up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
249 Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to five weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU (0.12-0.24 ml) of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 5 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU (0.24 ml) three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
Individual pre-filled pens should be for single patient use only.
Prepare the GONAL-f pre-filled pen and inject the solution once dose has been selected.
The next injection should be done at the same time the next day.
Your doctor has prescribed you a dose of GONAL-f in IU.
• Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use are as clean as possible.
• Assemble everything you need:
Find a clean area and lay out everything (two alcohol swabs, the pre-filled pen and a needle for administration).
See illustration.

1.
Preparing the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to first use:
Remove the pen cap and attach a needle as described in section 3.
Then prime the pen by setting the dose arrow at 37.5 black scale-mark highlighted with a small dot.
Pull out the injection button as far as it will go, remove the outer needle cap and the inner needle cap and hold the pre-filled pen with the needle pointing upwards.
Tap the reservoir holder gently with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.
With the needle still pointing upwards, depress the injection button fully.
A drop of liquid must appear at the tip of the needle; this indicates that your pre-filled pen is primed for injection.
The amount of liquid seen at the needle tip is just the overfill from the pre-filled pen (generally less than 37.5 IU).
If no liquid appears the first time, repeat a second time until a drop of liquid appears at the needle tip.
Then set the dose as describe in section 4.
2.
For the next usage attach a needle as described in section 3 and set the dose as described in section 4.
3.
Attaching a needle:
Take a new needle.
If the peel tab closing the outer needle cap is damaged or loose, do not use it.
Discard the needle and take a new one.
Remove the peel tab from the outer needle cap.
Hold the outer needle cap firmly, press the threaded tip of the pre-filled pen into the outer needle cap and twist it clockwise until it is securely fixed.
Caution:
Use only the single-use disposable needles provided within the GONAL-f pre-filled pen pack or distributed separately.
4.
Setting the dose:
Set the required dose by turning the black dosage dial in either
251 direction until the dose arrow is pointing to the dose you require (The black dosage dial lets you set the dose in steps of 37.5 IU.
The minimum dose and the maximum dose that you can set are respectively equal to 37.5 IU and 300 IU).
Once you have set your dose, load it by pulling the injection button out as far as it will go.
Take care to pull the button straight and not to twist it out, this might change the set dose.
Caution: carefully check the dosage dial before pulling out the injection button because it cannot be corrected after it has been loaded.
If after having pulled out the injection button you realize that you have set and loaded a wrong dose, do not inject.
Discard the dose to waste and repeat the dose setting correctly.
Check the red dosage control dial on the injection button in order to ensure that the correct dose has been loaded:
When the injection button is pulled out, the loaded dose is indicated by the last mark (flat arrow) on the red dosage control dial that is coming out and appears visible (the example in the Figure shows the injection button pulled out and a loaded dose of 150 IU).
If the loaded dose is lower than the set dose, then the dose will not be complete.
In this case, follow the instructions given below in the point 2. of the Note section.
If the same dose is required every time, then the dose arrow can be left pointing at the same position on the dosage dial.
5.
Injecting the dose:
Choose an injection site according to the instructions given by your medical practitioner or nurse.
Clean the injection site by wiping with an alcohol swab.
Use the injection technique as advised by your medical practitioner or nurse.
Insert the needle into the skin and press the injection button as far as it will go.
Check that the grey indicator on the injection button is no longer visible.
This confirms that the delivery of the dose is complete.
You must keep the needle in the skin and press down the injection button for at least 10 seconds.
Whilst keeping the injection button pressed down, take the needle out of the skin.
6.
Removing the needle:
Remove the needle after each injection and discard it.
Hold the pre-filled pen firmly by the reservoir holder.
Carefully put back the outer needle cap onto the needle.
Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the needle by turning counterclockwise.
Dispose of the used needle safely.
Now put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen.
7.
Storing the pre-filled pen:
After injecting your dose remove the used needle as described in the point 6 above.
Put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen.
Store the GONAL-f pre- filled pen in a safe place, preferably in the original package.
When the pre-filled pen is empty, discard it.
Note:
1.
The scale that can be seen through the reservoir holder is an indicator of the medicine volume remaining in the reservoir.
It must not be used to set the dose.
252 2.
The red dosage control dial on the injection button enables you to check whether the last dose will be complete or not.
It can only be pulled out as far as the mark (flat arrow) indicating the amount of medicine remaining in the reservoir.
If the loaded dose is not sufficient to complete your injection, you have two possibilities: a.
Inject the partial dose (remained in this pre-filled pen) and then complete immediately the injection of the rest of the dose using a new pre-filled pen (do not to forget to record the partial dose). b.
Discard the pre-filled pen and inject the full dose using a new pre-filled pen.
If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
These problems may affect more than 10 patients out of 100 treated.
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see section 2) can occur (between 1 and 10 patients out of 100 treated patients).
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
This can occurs in 1% of the patients or less.
In very rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (less than 1 patient in 1000).
In order to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Very rarely (less than 1 in 10000 patients) abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa/ hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
253 Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG (between 1 and 10% of the patients).
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

Further information
1.
WHAT GONAL-f IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GONAL-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa, which is made in laboratories by special recombinant DNA techniques.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Therapeutic indications
• GONAL-f can be used to cause ovulation in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• GONAL-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
• GONAL-f is used together with another hormone called lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone) to cause ovulation in women who are not ovulating due to very low production of the fertility hormones (FSH and LH) by their pituitary gland.
• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
Do not use GONAL-f
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or to any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f • if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
258 If you are a woman:
• if you have ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • if you have gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • if you have ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
• if you have irreversible testicular damage
Take special care with GONAL-f
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see Section 4).
However, if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
GONAL-f treatment seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/ embryos replaced.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
Miscarriages are higher than in the normal population, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
Using other medicines:
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce down regulation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
259 Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day (0.12-0.24 ml).
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually lower than 225 IU FSH (0.36 ml).
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU (0.24-0.36 ml) of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU (0.72 ml) daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5000 IU up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
260 Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to five weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU (0.12-0.24 ml) of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 5 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU (0.24 ml) three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.

For the next usage attach a needle as described in section 3 and set the dose as described in section 4.
3.
Attaching a needle:
Take a new needle.
If the peel tab closing the outer needle cap is damaged or loose, do not use it.
Discard the needle and take a new one.
Remove the peel tab from the outer needle cap.
Hold the outer needle cap firmly, press the threaded tip of the pre-filled pen into the outer needle cap and twist it clockwise until it is securely fixed.
Caution:
Use only the single-use disposable needles provided within the GONAL-f pre-filled pen pack or distributed separately.
4.
Setting the dose:
Set the required dose by turning the black dosage dial in either
262 direction until the dose arrow is pointing to the dose you require (The black dosage dial lets you set the dose in steps of 37.5 IU.
The minimum dose and the maximum dose that you can set are respectively equal to 37.5 IU and 450 IU).
Once you have set your dose, load it by pulling the injection button out as far as it will go.
Take care to pull the button straight and not to twist it out, this might change the set dose.
Caution: carefully check the dosage dial before pulling out the injection button because it cannot be corrected after it has been loaded.
If after having pulled out the injection button you realize that you have set and loaded a wrong dose, do not inject.
Discard the dose to waste and repeat the dose setting correctly.
Check the red dosage control dial on the injection button in order to ensure that the correct dose has been loaded:
When the injection button is pulled out, the loaded dose is indicated by the last mark (flat arrow) on the red dosage control dial that is coming out and appears visible (the example in the Figure shows the injection button pulled out and a loaded dose of 150 IU).
If the loaded dose is lower than the set dose, then the dose will not be complete.
In this case, follow the instructions given below in the point 2. of the Note section.
If the same dose is required every time, then the dose arrow can be left pointing at the same position on the dosage dial.
5.
Injecting the dose:
Choose an injection site according to the instructions given by your medical practitioner or nurse.
Clean the injection site by wiping with an alcohol swab.
Use the injection technique as advised by your medical practitioner or nurse.
Insert the needle into the skin and press the injection button as far as it will go.
Check that the grey indicator on the injection button is no longer visible.
This confirms that the delivery of the dose is complete.
You must keep the needle in the skin and press down the injection button for at least 10 seconds.
Whilst keeping the injection button pressed down, take the needle out of the skin.
6.
Removing the needle:
Remove the needle after each injection and discard it.
Hold the pre-filled pen firmly by the reservoir holder.
Carefully put back the outer needle cap onto the needle.
Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the needle by turning counterclockwise.
Dispose of the used needle safely.
Now put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen.
7.
Storing the pre-filled pen:
After injecting your dose remove the used needle as described in the point 6 above.
Put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen.
Store the GONAL-f pre- filled pen in a safe place, preferably in the original package.
When the pre-filled pen is empty, discard it.
Note:
1.
The scale that can be seen through the reservoir holder is an indicator of the medicine volume remaining in the reservoir.
It must not be used to set the dose.
263 2.
The red dosage control dial on the injection button enables you to check whether the last dose will be complete or not.
It can only be pulled out as far as the mark (flat arrow) indicating the amount of medicine remaining in the reservoir.
If the loaded dose is not sufficient to complete your injection, you have two possibilities: a.
Inject the partial dose (remained in this pre-filled pen) and then complete immediately the injection of the rest of the dose using a new pre-filled pen (do not forget to record the partial dose). b.
Discard the pre-filled pen and inject the full dose using a new pre-filled pen.
If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2)
If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
These problems may affect more than 10 patients out of 100 treated.
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see section 2) can occur (between 1 and 10 patients out of 100 treated patients).
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
This can occurs in 1% of the patients or less.
In very rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (less than 1 patient in 1000).
In order to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Very rarely (less than 1 in 10000 patients) abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa/ hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
264 Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG (between 1 and 10% of the patients).
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

Further information
1.
WHAT GONAL-f IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GONAL-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa, which is made in laboratories by special recombinant DNA techniques.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Therapeutic indications
• GONAL-f can be used to cause ovulation in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• GONAL-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
• GONAL-f is used together with another hormone called lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone) to cause ovulation in women who are not ovulating due to very low production of the fertility hormones (FSH and LH) by their pituitary gland.
• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
Do not use GONAL-f
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f. • if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.
269 If you are a woman:
• if you have ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • if you have gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • if you have ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
• if you have irreversible testicular damage.
Take special care with GONAL-f
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see Section 4).
However, if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
GONAL-f treatment seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/ embryos replaced.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
Miscarriages are higher than in the normal population, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
Using other medicines:
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
270 Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce down regulation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day (0.12-0.24 ml).
This may be increased by 37.5-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually lower than 225 IU FSH (0.36 ml).
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU (0.24-0.36 ml) of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU (0.72 ml) daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5000 IU up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
271 Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to five weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU (0.12-0.24 ml) of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 5 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU (0.24 ml) three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
Individual pre-filled pens should be for single patient use only.
Prepare the GONAL-f pre-filled pen and inject the solution once dose has been selected.
The next injection should be done at the same time the next day.
Your doctor has prescribed you a dose of GONAL-f in IU.
• Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use are as clean as possible.
• Assemble everything you need:
Find a clean area and lay out everything (two alcohol swabs, the pre-filled pen and a needle for administration).
See illustration.

1.
Preparing the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to first use:
Remove the pen cap and attach a needle as described in section 4.
Then prime the pen by setting the dose arrow at 37.5 scale-mark highlighted with a small dot.
Pull out the injection button as far as it will go, remove the outer needle cap and the inner needle cap and hold the pre-filled pen with the needle pointing upwards.
Tap the reservoir holder gently with the finger so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.
With the needle still pointing upwards, depress the injection button fully.
A drop of liquid must appear at the tip of the needle; this indicates that your pre-filled pen is primed for injection.
The amount of liquid seen at the needle tip is just the overfill from the pre-filled pen (generally less than 37.5 IU).
If no liquid appears the first time, repeat a second time until a drop of liquid appears at the needle tip.
Then set the dose as describe in section 4.
2.
For the next usage attach a needle as described in section 3 and set the dose as described in section 4.
3.
Attaching a needle:
Take a new needle.
If the peel tab closing the outer needle cap is damaged or loose, do not use it.
Discard the needle and take a new one.
Remove the peel tab from the outer needle cap.
Hold the outer needle cap firmly, press the threaded tip of the pre-filled pen into the outer needle cap and twist it clockwise until it is securely fixed.
Caution:
Use only the single-use disposable needles provided within the GONAL-f pre-filled pen pack or distributed separately.
4.
Setting the dose:
Set the required dose by turning the black dosage dial in either
273 direction until the dose arrow is pointing to the dose you require (The black dosage dial lets you set the dose in steps of 37.5 IU.
The minimum dose and the maximum dose that you can set are respectively equal to 37.5 IU and 450 IU).
Once you have set your dose, load it by pulling the injection button out as far as it will go.
Take care to pull the button straight and not to twist it out, this might change the set dose.
Caution: carefully check the dosage dial before pulling out the injection button because it cannot be corrected after it has been loaded.
If after having pulled out the injection button you realize that you have set and loaded a wrong dose, do not inject.
Discard the dose to waste and repeat the dose setting correctly.
Check the red dosage control dial on the injection button in order to ensure that the correct dose has been loaded:
When the injection button is pulled out, the loaded dose is indicated by the last mark (flat arrow) on the red dosage control dial that is coming out and appears visible (the example in the Figure shows the injection button pulled out and a loaded dose of 150 IU).
If the loaded dose is lower than the set dose, then the dose will not be complete.
In this case, follow the instructions given below in the point 2. of the Note section.
If the same dose is required every time, then the dose arrow can be left pointing at the same position on the dosage dial.
5.
Injecting the dose:
Choose an injection site according to the instructions given by your medical practitioner or nurse.
Clean the injection site by wiping with an alcohol swab.
Use the injection technique as advised by your medical practitioner or nurse.
Insert the needle into the skin and press the injection button as far as it will go.
Check that the grey indicator on the injection button is no longer visible.
This confirms that the delivery of the dose is complete.
You must keep the needle in the skin and press down the injection button for at least 10 seconds.
Whilst keeping the injection button pressed down, take the needle out of the skin.
6.
Removing the needle:
Remove the needle after each injection and discard it.
Hold the pre-filled pen firmly by the reservoir holder.
Carefully put back the outer needle cap onto the needle.
Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the needle by turning counterclockwise.
Dispose of the used needle safely.
Now put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen.
7.
Storing the pre-filled pen:
After injecting your dose remove the used needle as described in the point 6 above.
Put back the pre-filled pen cap on the pre-filled pen.
Store the GONAL-f pre- filled pen in a safe place, preferably in the original package.
When the pre-filled pen is empty, discard it.
Note:
1.
The scale that can be seen through the reservoir holder is an indicator of the medicine volume remaining in the reservoir.
It must not be used to set the dose.
274 2.
The red dosage control scale on the injection button enables you to check whether the last dose will be complete or not.
It can only be pulled out as far as the mark (flat arrow) indicating the amount of medicine remaining in the reservoir.
If the loaded dose is no sufficient to complete your injection, you have two possibilities: a.
Inject the partial dose (remained in this pre-filled pen) and then complete immediately the injection of the rest of the dose using a new pre-filled pen (do not forget to record the partial dose). b.
Discard the pre-filled pen and inject the full dose using a new pre-filled pen.
If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
These problems may effect more than 10 patients out of 100 treated.
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see also section 2) can occur (between 1 and 10 patients out of 100 treated patients).
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
This can occurs in 1% of the patients or less.
In very rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (less than 1 patient in 1000).
In order to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Very rarely (less than 1 in 10000 patients) abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa/ hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
275 Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG (between 1 and 10% of the patients).
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
