The educational pack should contain the following • Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet for ReFacto AF • The educational materials.
The educational pack for Healthcare Professionals should include the educational materials to be provided by prescribers to patients before they receive RefactoAF.
The educational materials for Healthcare professionals, patients and haemophiliac patients associations should include the following key elements: • The main differences between ReFacto AF and ReFacto • Changes highlighted in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet for ReFacto AF • The visual points of differentiation in packaging for ReFacto AF versus ReFacto • Specific instructions regarding the proper identification, dosing and monitoring of ReFacto AF. • That after switching to ReFacto AF, patients should remain on ReFacto AF and not switch back to ReFacto. • The potential risks for medication errors in using different assays or laboratory standard for patient monitoring Information that the chromogenic substrate assay is strongly recommended to be used by laboratories when monitoring patients receiving ReFacto AF and that typically one stage clotting assay results are 20-50% lower than the chromogenic substrate assay results • The existence of another moroctocog alfa containing product for use outside Europe with a different potency assigned using a one stage clotting essay and the need for patients to take an adequate supply of their ReFacto AF for anticipated treatment while traveling.
