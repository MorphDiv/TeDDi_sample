Print Options
Specifies the print setting options.
Reduce print data
You can reduce the amount of data to be sent to the printer.
Reducing the print data increases the print speed because the print files are smaller.
This makes it easier for printers with a smaller memory to print.
Reducing print data can result in slightly lower print quality.
Settings for
Specifies whether the print settings apply to direct printing or to printing to a file.
Reduce transparency
If you mark this field the transparent objects will be printed like normal, non-transparent objects, depending on your selection in the following two option buttons.
Transparency cannot be output directly to a printer.
The areas of the document in which transparency is to be visible must therefore always be calculated as bitmaps and sent to the printer.
Depending on the size of the bitmaps and the print resolution a large amount of data may result.
Automatically
Specifies that the transparency is only printed if the transparent area covers less than a quarter of the entire page.
No transparency
With this option transparency is never printed.
Reduce bitmaps
Specifies that bitmaps are printed with reduced quality.
The resolution can only be reduced and not increased.
High/normal print quality
High print quality corresponds to a resolution of 300dpi.
Normal print quality corresponds to a resolution of 200dpi.
Resolution
Specifies the maximum print quality in dpi.
The resolution can only be reduced and not increased.
Include transparent objects
If this field is marked, the reduction in print quality for bitmaps also applies to the transparent areas of objects.
Reduce gradients
If this field is marked, gradients are printed with reduced quality.
Gradient stripes
Specifies the maximum number of gradient stripes for printing.
Intermediate colour
Specifies that gradients are only printed in a single intermediate colour.
Convert colours to greyscale
Specifies that all colours are printed only as greyscale.
Printer warnings
Defines which warnings appear before printing begins.
Paper size
Mark this check box if a certain paper size is needed for printing the current document.
If the paper size used in the document is not provided by the current printer, you will receive an error message.
Paper orientation
Mark this check box if you need a certain paper orientation for printing the current document.
If the format used by the current document is not available from the printer, an error message will appear.
Transparency
Mark this check box if you always want to be warned if transparent objects are contained in the document.
If you print such a document, a dialogue box appears in which you can select if the transparency is to be printed in this print instruction.
