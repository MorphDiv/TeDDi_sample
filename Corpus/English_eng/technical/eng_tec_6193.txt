The meaning of the columns in this list:
Name: port or node name, the number can change with each bus reset
GUID: the 64 bit GUID of the node
Local: checked if the node is an IEEE 1394 port of your computer
IRM: checked if the node is isochronous resource manager capable
CRM: checked if the node is cycle master capable
ISO: checked if the node supports isochronous transfers
BM: checked if the node is bus manager capable
PM: checked if the node is power management capable
Acc: the cycle clock accuracy of the node, valid from 0 to 100
Speed: the speed of the node
Vendor: the vendor of the device
