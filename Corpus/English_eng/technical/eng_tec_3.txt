$[officename] Chart Features
Charts allow you to present data so that it is easy to visualise.
You can create a chart from source data in a Calc spreadsheet or a Writer table.
When the chart is embedded in the same document as the data, it stays linked to the data, so that the chart automatically updates when you change the source data.
Chart Types
Choose from a variety of 3-D charts and 2-D charts, such as bar charts, line charts, stock charts.
You can change chart types with a few clicks of the mouse.
Individual Formatting
You can customise individual chart elements, such as axes, data labels, and legends, by right-clicking them in the chart, or with toolbar icons and menu commands.
