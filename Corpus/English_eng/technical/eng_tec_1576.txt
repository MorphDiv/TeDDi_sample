Not operator (logical)
Not Operator [Run-time]
Negates an expression by inverting the bit values.
Syntax:
Result = Not Expression
Parameters:
Result:
A numerical variable that will contain the result of the negation.
Expression:
Boolean or numerical expression that you want to negate.
When a Boolean expression is negated, the value True changes to False and the value False changes to True.
In a bitwise negation each individual bit is inverted.
Example:
Sub ExampleNot
Dim vA as Variant, vB as Variant, vC as Variant, vD as Variant
Dim vOut as Variant
vA = 10: vB = 8: vC = 6: vD = Null
vOut = Not vA REM Returns -11
vOut = Not(vC > vD) REM Returns -1
vOut = Not(vB > vA) REM Returns -1
vOut = Not(vA > vB) REM Returns 0
end Sub
