The Babel & konqueror; plugin
Using the Babelfish plugin
Babelfish is a machine translation service provided by AltaVista.
The plugin allows you to automatically translate web pages between several languages.
The Babelfish plugin can be accessed in the & konqueror; menubar under Tools Translate Web Page. Select from the list that drops down the language to translate from and the language to translate to.
If you have a portion of the text on the page selected, that will be translated instead of the entire & URL;.
Not all languages are available from the Babelfish service.
Machine translation is not a perfect science! Babelfish will at best give you a rough translation, and at worst will give you a very funny read. Do n't base important decisions on things you have read from a Babelfish translated page, without confirming that the translation is indeed accurate.
You may only translate web pages that are accessible on the world wide web. To translate any other text, you should go directly to the Babelfish site itself, where you are able to paste in text for translation.
