Installation

This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP on Linux distributions.
Many Linux distributions have some sort of package installation system, such as RPM.
This can assist in setting up a standard configuration, but if you need to have a different set of features (such as a secure server, or a different database driver), you may need to build PHP and / or your webserver.
If you are unfamiliar with building and compiling your own software, it is worth checking to see whether somebody has already built a packaged version of PHP with the features you need.
