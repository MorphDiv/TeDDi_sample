(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns:
TRUE on success, FALSE on error.
mssql_close() closes the link to a MS SQL Server database that's associated with the specified link identifier.
If the link identifier isn 't specified, the last opened link is assumed.
Note that this isn' t usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are automatically closed at the end of the script's execution.
mssql_close() will not close persistent links generated by mssql_pconnect().
See also: mssql_connect(), mssql_pconnect().
