ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
& kplato; Main window
Here is the default & kplato; main window when you load an existing project.
Here's a screenshot of & kplato;
& kplato; main window
At the top there is the menubar (1). All & kplato; functions are available from the menus, which are described in detail in.
Below the menubar are located the toolbars (2) and (3). You can show or hide them using the Settings Toolbars menu. You can also configure the toolbars (add or remove actions) using the Settings Configure Toolbars... dialog.
(3) is the view toolbar. It allows you to quickly switch between different views: Gantt, Resources or Accounts.
(4) is the main view. In the Gantt view currently shown on the screenshot, you have 2 panes, one with the tasks names and one with the Gantt chart.
(5) is the resource pane which you can see in the Gantt and Resources views but not in the Account view. It is not shown per default and you can drag the separation bar to display it.
