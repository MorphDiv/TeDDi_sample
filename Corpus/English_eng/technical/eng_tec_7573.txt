4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
It is prudent to reserve third generation cephalosporins for the treatment of clinical conditions, which have responded poorly, or are expected to respond poorly, to other classes of antimicrobials or first generation cephalosporins.
Use of the product should be based on susceptibility testing and take into account official and local antimicrobial policies.
The safety of Convenia has not been assessed in animals suffering from severe renal dysfunction.
Pyoderma is often secondary to an underlying disease.
It is, therefore, advisable to determine the underlying cause and to treat the animal accordingly.
Caution should be exercised in patients that have previously shown hypersensitivity reactions to cefovecin, other cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs.
If an allergic reaction occurs, no further administrations of cefovecin should be administered and appropriate therapy for beta-lactam hypersensitivity should be instituted.
Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with epinephrine and other emergency measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamine, corticosteroids, and airway management, as clinically indicated.
Veterinarians should be aware that reappearance of the allergic symptoms may occur when symptomatic therapy is discontinued.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Penicillins and cephalosporins may cause hypersensitivity (allergy) following injection, inhalation, ingestion or skin contact.
Hypersensitivity to penicillins may lead to cross sensitivity to cephalosporins and vice versa.
Allergic reactions to these substances may occasionally be serious:
Do not handle this product if you know you are sensitised or if you have been advised not to work with such preparations.
Handle this product with care to avoid exposure, taking all recommended precautions.
If you develop symptoms following exposure, such as a skin rash, you should seek medical advice and show the doctor this warning.
Swelling of the face, lips or eyes or difficulty in breathing are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.
If you know you are allergic to penicillins or cephalosporins, avoid contact with contaminated litter.
In the event of contact, wash skin with soap and water.
3 4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
On very rare occasions gastrointestinal signs including emesis and/ or diarrhoea have been observed.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of Convenia in dogs and cats has not been established during pregnancy and lactation.
Treated animals should not be used for breeding for 12 weeks after the last administration.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concurrent use of other substances that have a high degree of protein binding (e. g. furosemide, ketoconazole, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) may compete with cefovecin binding and thus may cause adverse effects.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For infections requiring prolonged treatment.
The antimicrobial activity of Convenia following a single injection lasts for up to 14 days.
Skin and soft tissue infections in dogs:
A single subcutaneous injection of 8 mg/ kg bodyweight (1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight).
If required, treatment may be repeated at 14 day intervals up to a further three times.
In accordance with good veterinary practice, treatment of pyoderma should be extended beyond complete resolution of clinical signs.
Skin and soft tissue abscesses and wounds in cats:
A single subcutaneous injection of 8 mg/ kg bodyweight (1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight).
If required, an additional dose may be administered 14 days after the first injection.
Urinary tract infections in dogs and cats:
A single subcutaneous injection of 8 mg/ kg bodyweight (1 ml per 10 kg bodyweight).
To reconstitute, withdraw 10 ml of the supplied diluent from its vial and add to the vial containing the lyophilised powder.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antibacterials for systemic use (cephalosporins).
ATCvet code:
QJ01DD91.
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Cefovecin is a third generation cephalosporin with a broad-spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
It differs from other cephalosporins in that it is highly protein bound and has a long duration of activity.
As with all cephalosporins, the action of cefovecin results from the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis; cefovecin has bactericidal activity.
Cefovecin exhibits in-vitro activity against Staphylococcus intermedius and Pasteurella multocida which are associated with canine and feline skin infections.
Anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium spp. collected from feline abscesses were also shown to be susceptible.
In addition, cefovecin exhibits in-vitro activity against Escherichia coli which is associated with canine and feline urinary tract infections.
In-vitro activity against these pathogens as well as against other skin and urinary tract pathogens collected during a European (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom) MIC survey (1999 – 2000) and during European (France, Germany, Spain and United Kingdom) clinical efficacy and safety field studies (2001 – 2003) are listed below:

Lowest concentration, which completely inhibits visible growth of at least 50% of isolates 2 Lowest concentration, which completely inhibits visible growth of at least 90% of isolates 3 Some of these pathogens (e. g.
S. aureus) exhibited natural in vitro resistance to cefovecin 4 The clinical significance of these in vitro data has not been demonstrated.
Resistance to cephalosporins results from enzymatic inactivation (β -lactamase production), from reduced permeability by porin mutations or change in efflux, or by selection of low-affinity penicillin- binding proteins.
Resistance may be chromosomal or plasmid-encoded and may be transferred if associated with transposons or plasmids.
Cross resistance with other cephalosporins and other beta- lactam antibacterials can be observed.
When applying a proposed microbiological breakpoint of S ≤ 2 µg/ ml, no resistance to cefovecin was detected in Pasteurella multocida and Fusobacterium spp. field isolates.
When applying a proprosed microbiological breakpoint of I ≤ 4 µg/ ml, cefovecin resistance in S. intermedius and beta-haemolytic Streptococci isolates was less than 0.02%.
The percentage of cefovecin resistant isolates in E. coli, Prevotella oralis, Bacteroides spp. and Proteus spp. were 2.3%, 2.7%, 3.1% and 1.4%, respectively.
The percentage of cefovecin resistant isolates in coagulase negative Staphylococci spp.
(e. g.
S. xylosus, S. schleiferi, S. epidermidis) is 9.5%.
Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus spp, and Bordetella bronchiseptica isolates are inherently resistant to cefovecin.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Cefovecin has unique pharmacokinetic properties with extremely long elimination half-lives in both dogs and cats.
In dogs, when cefovecin was administered as a single subcutaneous dose of 8 mg/ kg bodyweight, absorption was rapid and extensive; peak plasma concentration at 6 hours was 120 µg/ ml and bioavailability approximately 99%.
Peak concentrations in tissue cage fluid of 31.9 µg/ ml were measured 2 days after administration.
Fourteen days after administration, the mean cefovecin concentration in plasma was 5.6 µg/ ml.
Plasma protein binding is high (96.0% to 98.7%) and the volume of distribution is low (0.1 l/ kg).
Elimination half-life is long – approximately 5.5 days.
Cefovecin is primarily eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.
At fourteen days after administration, urine concentrations were 2.9 µg/ ml.
In cats, when cefovecin was administered as a single subcutaneous dose of 8 mg/ kg bodyweight, absorption was rapid and extensive; peak plasma concentration at 2 hours was 141 µg/ ml and bioavailability approximately 99%.
Fourteen days after administration the mean cefovecin concentration in plasma was 18 µg/ ml.
Plasma protein binding is high (more than 99%) and the volume of distribution is low (0.09 l/ kg).
Elimination half-life is long - approximately 6.9 days.
Cefovecin is primarily eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.
At ten and fourteen days after administration, urine concentrations were 1.3 µg/ ml and 0.7 µg/ ml, respectively.
Following repeated
6 administrations at the recommended dose, elevated concentrations of cefovecin were observed in plasma.

S. xylosus, S. schleiferi, S. epidermidis) is 9.5%.
Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus spp, and Bordetella bronchiseptica isolates are inherently resistant to cefovecin.
Cefovecin has unique pharmacokinetic properties with extremely long elimination half-lives in both dogs and cats.
The product is available in a single pack size composed of a vial containing the freeze-dried powder, and a second vial containing the diluent.
Reconstitution yields 10 ml of solution for injection.
