kig

an interactive geometry program for & kde;
kig -c, --convert-to-native -o, --outfile filename KDE Generic Options Qt Generic Options
Description
& kig; is an application for interactive geometry. It is intended to serve two purposes:
To allow students to interactively explore mathematical figures and concepts using the computer;
To serve as a WYSIWYG tool for drawing mathematical figures and including them in other documents.
With this program you can do geometry on a computer just like you would on a blackboard in a classroom. However the program allows you to move and change parts of a geometrical drawing so that you can see how other parts change as a result.
& kig; supports loci and user-defined macros. It also imports and exports both to and from foreign file formats including Cabri, Dr. Geo, & kgeo;, KSeg and XFig.
This application is part of the official & kde; edutainment module.
Options
App options, in a variablelist
-c, --convert-to-native
Do not show a & GUI;. Instead convert the specified file to native & kig; format. The native & kig; file will be written to standard output unless --outfile is passed.
-o, --outfile filename
Used with --convert-to-native to specify where to save the newly created & kig; file. Not specifying this option, or providing a filename of - will output the file to standard output.
