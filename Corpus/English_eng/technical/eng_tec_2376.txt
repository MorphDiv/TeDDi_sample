(PHP 4 = 4.0.4)
array_sum() returns the sum of values in an array as an integer or float.
Example 1. array_sum() examples
$a = array( 2, 4, 6, 8); echo "sum(a) = ".array_sum($a) ."\n"; $b = array("a"= 1.2 ,"b"= 2.3 ,"c"= 3.4); echo "sum(b) = ".array_sum($b) ."\n";
The printout of the program above will be:
sum( a) = 20 sum(b) = 6.9
Note:
PHP versions prior to 4.0.6 modified the passed array itself and converted strings to numbers (which most of the time converted them to zero, depending on their value).
