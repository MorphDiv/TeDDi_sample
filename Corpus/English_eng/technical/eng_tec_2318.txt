Handling file uploads
Next
The MAX_FILE_SIZE item cannot specify a file size greater than the file size that has been set in the upload_max_filesize ini-setting.
The default is 2 Megabytes.
If memory limit is enabled, larger memory_limit may be needed.
Make sure to set memory_limit large enough.
If max_execution_time is set too small, script execution may be exceeded the value.
Make sure to set max_execution_time large enough.
If post_max_size set too small, large files cannot be uploaded.
Make sure to set post_max_size large enough.
Not validating which file you operate on may mean that users can access sensitive information in other directories.
Please note that the CERN httpd seems to strip off everything starting at the first whitespace in the content-type mime header it gets from the client.
As long as this is the case, CERN httpd will not support the file upload feature.
Due to the large amount of directory listing styles we cannot guarantee that files with exotic names (like containing spaces) are handled properly.
