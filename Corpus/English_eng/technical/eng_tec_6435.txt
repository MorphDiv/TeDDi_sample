Command to execute
A regular expression matching the window title If you do not specify one, then the very first window to appear will be taken - not recommended.
The window id of the target window Specifies the id of the window to use. If the id starts with 0x it is assumed to be in hex.
Hide the window to the tray on startup
Wait until we are told to show the window before executing the command
Sets the initial tooltip for the tray icon
Keep the tray icon even if the client exits. This option has no effect unless startonshow is specified.
Use ksystraycmd's icon instead of the window's icon in the systray (should be used with --icon to specify ksystraycmd icon)
Try to keep the window above other windows
Quit the client when we are told to hide the window. This has no effect unless startonshow is specified and implies keeprunning.
No command or window specified
