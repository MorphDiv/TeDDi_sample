Introduction
& okular; is a & kde; universal document viewer based on the code of the & kpdf; application. Although being based on & kpdf; code, & okular; has some unique features such as overview mode, improved presentation support and annotation support.
Basic Usage
Opening Files
To view any supported file in & okular;, select File Open..., choose a supported file in the dialog and click Open. Your file should now be displayed in the main window.
If you have already opened files in & okular; before, you can quickly access them by selecting them in the File Open Recent menu.
After having a file opened you probably want to read it and therefore navigate through it. Go to the next section to learn more about this.
Navigating
This section describes how you can navigate through a document in & okular;.
There are multiple ways of scrolling the viewing area. One is to use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys. You may also use the scrollbar, your mousewheel or the Page Up and Page Down keys.
Another way is to hold the & LMB; down at any place on the document while dragging the mouse in the opposite direction of where you want to move. This procedure only works if the Browse Tool is enabled, which you can select by choosing Tools Browse Tool.
The navigation panel on the left side of the screen enables two more ways of navigating through a document:
If you click on a page thumbnail the viewing area will be brought to that page.
If the document has a table of contents, clicking on a table of contents item will bring the document to the page linked to that item.
Some documents have links. In this case you can click on them and the view will change to the page it links to. If the link is to a web page or some other document the default & kde; handler for that format will be invoked. For example, clicking on a link pointing to http: / /www. kde. org will open the web page in the default & kde; 's web browser.
Additionally, you may use the following functionality to quickly move to specific places in the document:
You can go to the first page of the document using Ctrl; Home or using Go First Page.
You can go to the last page of the document using Ctrl; End or using Go Last Page.
You can go forward in the document using Space or Page Down. To go to the next page of the document use the Next Page Toolbar button or Go Next Page in the menubar.
You can go back in the document using & Backspace; or Page Up. To go to the previous page of the document use Previous Page Toolbar button or Go Previous Page in the menubar.
Presentation Mode
The Presentation mode represents another way to view documents in & okular;. It can be enabled in View Presentation. It shows the document on a page per page basis. The pages are shown with zoom to page, that means all the page is visible.
& PDF; documents can even specify that they are always opened in presentation mode.
When in presentation mode, you have an helper bar located on the top of the screen. Just move the mouse cursor to the top of the screen to make it appear.
To navigate between pages you may use the & LMB; (next page) and the & RMB; (previous page), the mouse wheel, the arrow icons or the line edit in the top bar, or the keys specified in the Navigating section.
You can exit presentation mode at any time by pressing the & Esc; key or clicking the Quit icon in the top bar.
You can also draw on the current page with a pencil. Click on the Toggle Drawing Mode icon in the top bar to enable or disable the possibility of draw in the presentation mode. The drawings are cleared automatically when switching to another page, or manually selecting the Erase Drawings icon in the top bar.
The presentation mode has support for more than one screen in a multi-monitor configuration. With more than one screen a new button will appear in the top bar, with the icon of a screen: this is a drop down box that allows you to move the presentation to any of the other available screens.
Presentation mode has some configuration options, you can find their description in the chapter Configuring & okular;.
& okular; Advanced Features
Embedded Files
If the current document has some files embedded in it, when you open it a yellow bar will appear above the page view to notify you about the embedded files.
The embedded files bar
The embedded files bar
In this case, you can either click on the link in the text of the bar or choose File Embedded Files to open the embedded files dialog. The dialog allows you to view the embedded files and to extract them.
Annotations
& okular; allows you to review and annotate your documents. Annotations created in & okular; are automatically saved in the internal local data folder for each user. & okular; does not implicitly change any document it opens.
Since & kde; 4.2, & okular; has the "document archiving" feature. This is an & okular; -specific format for carrying the document plus various metadata related to it (currently only annotations). You can save a "document archive" from the open document by choosing File Export As Document Archive. To open an & okular; document archive, just open it with & okular; as it would be & eg; a & PDF; document.
Due to DRM limitations (typically with & PDF; documents), adding, editing some properties or removing annotations could not be possible.
Adding annotations
To add some annotations to the document, you have to activate the annotating toolbar. This is done by either selecting Tools Review or pressing F6. Once the annotating toolbar is shown, just press one of its buttons to start constructing that annotation.
The annotating toolbar can be docked in any side of the viewing area: just drag it to move it to another place.
Activating the annotating toolbar will make you switch to the Normal Mode.
You can stop the construction any time by pressing again on the button of the annotation you are constructing, or by pressing the & Esc; key.
The newly constructed annotation will have as author the author you set in the Identity page in & okular; s configuration dialog.
Removing annotations
To remove an annotation, just click on it with the & RMB;, and select Delete.
When removing the annotation, its window will be closed if open.
This option could not be enabled because the document does not allow removing annotations.
Editing annotations
To edit an annotation, click on it with the & RMB; and select Properties. A dialog will appear with the general annotation settings (like color and opacity, author, & etc;) and the settings specific to that annotation type.
To move an annotation, hold down the & Ctrl; key, move the mouse pointer on it and then start dragging with the & LMB;.
Depending on the document permissions (typically with & PDF; documents), some options can be disabled.

Reload document on file change
Whether opened files should be automatically checked for changes and updated, if necessary.
Show backend selection dialog
Whether & okular; should ask the user which backend to use in case of more than one backend able to open the current file. If unchecked, & okular; will use the backend with the highest priority.

Convert to Black & White

Performance
Enable transparency effects
Draw selections and other special graphics using transparency effects. Disable the option to draw them using outline or opaque fill styles and increase speed on selections.
Enable background generation
Use a background thread to generate the pages. By disabling this option the user interface will become less reactive (will be blocked if necessary), but pages will be displayed a bit faster.
Memory Usage
& okular; can achieve best performance by tuning the memory usage, based on your system and your tastes. The more memory you let it to use, the faster the program will behave. The Default profile is good for every system, but you can prevent & okular; from using more memory than necessary by selecting the Low profile, or let it get the most out of your system using Aggressive.
Presentation
Advance every
Enables automatic advancing of pages given a time period.

This is the case when the document has references to the various points (usually row and column number) of sources it was generated from. The & DVI; format supports natively the addition of the information about the sources the LaTeX document was generated from. A similar system exists for & PDF; documents, called pdfsync, which stores these extra information in an external file named after the & PDF; file itself (for example mydocument. pdfsync for mydocument. pdf).
Command
This is the command and its parameters to invoke the selected editor with the source file of the actual document.
