Every slide is based on a slide master.
The text, pictures, tables, fields or other objects that you place on the slide master are visible as a background on all slides that are based on that slide master.
Masters exist for slides, notes, and handouts.

Adding predefined header or footer objects
see i53011
Every type of master has some predefined areas to hold the date, footer, and slide numbers.
When you switch to the master view, you can move that areas to any position on the master.
You can enter additional text and resize the areas.
You can select the contents of the areas and apply text formats.
For example, you can change the font size or colour.
A predefined Header Area is available only for notes and handouts.
If you want a header on all slides, you can move the Footer Area on the slide master to the top.
Objects that you insert on a slide master are visible on all slides that are based on that slide master.
