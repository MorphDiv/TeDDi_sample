3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection.
The suspension is a colourless light opalescent liquid.
The emulsion is a whitish homogeneous liquid.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Active immunisation against H5N1 subtype of Influenza A virus.
This indication is based on immunogenicity data from healthy subjects aged 18-60 years following administration of two doses of vaccine prepared from A/ VietNam/ 1194/ 2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1) (see section 5.1).
Prepandrix should be used in accordance with official guidance.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Posology
Adults from the age of 18 to 60 years:
1 dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.
A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.
There is no experience in children and adults above 60 years of age.
2 For further information, see section 5.1.
Method of administration
Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection.
4.3 Contraindications
History of an anaphylactic (i. e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate) of this vaccine.
See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 6.1.
Acute severe febrile illness.
Immunisation should be postponed.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to residues ((egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate).
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.
Prepandrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally.
Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The vaccine should not usually be given at the same time as other vaccines.
However, if co- administration with another vaccine is considered to be essential, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs.
It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified.
The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment.
Following influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1.
In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.
These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
No data have been generated in pregnant women with Prepandrix or with any other vaccine that contains the AS03 adjuvant.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3).
Healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations.
There are no data regarding the use of Prepandrix during lactation.
The potential benefits to the mother and risks to the infant should be considered before administering Prepandrix during lactation.
3 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “ Undesirable Effects” may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB02
Immune response against vaccine strain contained in Prepandrix:
In a consistency study, more than 900 subjects aged 18-60 years received Prepandrix following a 0, 21 days schedule.
Twenty-one days after the first and second dose of the vaccine, the seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-haemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody were as follows:
anti-HA antibody Seroprotection rate*† Seroconversion rate† Seroconversion factor† * anti-HA ≥ 1:40
21 days
after 1st dose 44.5% 42.5% 4.1
21 days after 2nd dose 94.3% 93.7% 39.8
† seroprotection rate: proportion of subjects with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre ≥ 1:40; seroconversion rate: proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-vaccination and have a protective post-vaccination titre of ≥ 1:40, or who were seropositive at pre-vaccination and have a 4- fold increase in titre; seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the pre-vaccination GMT.
Twenty-one days after administration of the second dose, 96.0% of subjects had a 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody titres.
A neutralising antibody titre of at least 1:80 was achieved in 97.8% of subjects at day 42.
In a dose finding study in subjects aged 18-60 years, 50 subjects received a dose of 3.75 micrograms HA/ AS03 in a volume of 1 ml at 0 and 21 days.
The seroprotection rates, seroconversion rates and seroconversion factors for anti-haemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibody at day 42 (post dose 2) and day 180 (persistence) were as follows:

† seroprotection rate: proportion of subjects with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre ≥ 1:40; seroconversion rate: proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-vaccination and have a protective post-vaccination titre of ≥ 1:40, or who were seropositive at pre-vaccination and have a 4- fold increase in titre; seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the pre-vaccination GMT.
Twenty one days after the second dose, a 4-fold increase in serum neutralising antibody titres was obtained in 77.1% of subjects against the A/ Indonesia/ 5/ 2005 strain, in 75.0% of subjects against A/ Anhui/ 01/ 2005 and in 85.0% of subjects against A/ Turkey/ Turkey/ 1/ 2005.
Information from non-clinical studies:
The ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous vaccine strains was assessed non-clinically using ferret challenge models.
6 In each experiment, four groups of six ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with an AS03 adjuvanted vaccine containing HA derived from H5N1/ A/ Vietnam/ 1194/ 04 (NIBRG-14).
Doses of 15, 5, 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms of HA were tested in the homologous challenge experiment, and doses of 15, 7.5, 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms of HA were tested in the heterologous challenge experiment.
Control groups included ferrets immunized with adjuvant alone, non-adjuvanted vaccine (15 micrograms HA) or phosphate buffered saline solution.
Ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the intra-tracheal route on day 49 with a lethal dose of either H5N1/ A/ Vietnam/ 1194/ 04 or heterologous H5N1/ A/ Indonesia/ 5/ 05.
Of the animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine, 87% and 96% were protected against the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge, respectively.
Viral shedding into the upper respiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk of viral transmission.
In the unadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant control group, all animals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of challenge.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Not applicable.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, embryo-foetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period).

• CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Not applicable
• OTHER CONDITIONS
Pharmacovigilance system The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in version V01 (dated June 2006) presented in Module 1.8.1. of the Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.
Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version RMPv3 (dated 31 January 2008) of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
11 PSURs
PSUR submission when Prepandrix is used during the influenza pandemic:
During a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/ 2004 will not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time.
Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic.
Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated.
In addition, duration a pandemic, resources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Reports in the format as defined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the European Union may not be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue.
In consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared (Phase 6 of the WHO global Influenza preparedness plan) and the prepandemic vaccine is used, the MAH shall submit periodic safety update reports with periodicity and format defined as follows:
Frequency of submission
- The clock will start from the first Monday after the date of announcement of the
influenza pandemic (Phase 6 of the WHO Preparedness Plan) (Day 0)
- First data-lock point is 14 days later.
- Report submission is no later than day 22 (i. e. the following Monday).
- Reporting to be fortnightly for the first 3 months of the pandemic.
- Periodicity will be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 3 monthly
intervals.
Format The report shall include the following Tables of aggregate data using the agreed templates:
1.
Fatal and/ or life-threatening reactions – for each Preferred Term (PT), including the proportion of fatal reports 2.
Adverse Events of Special Interest (PTs) 3.
Serious unexpected reactions (PTs) 4.
All events occurring in the following age groups:
6-23 months, 2-8 years, 8-17 years, 18-60 years, > 60 years All events occurring in pregnant women 5.
All events reported by patients that have been entered into the database by data-lock point 6.
A cumulative overview of all events reported during the period, stratified according to type of reporter (patient or health care professional), seriousness, expectedness, and whether spontaneous or solicited.
Presentation of data will take into consideration the following recommendations:
- Serious expected reactions will be reviewed by the MAH as part of their signal
detection procedures and will only form part of the report if an issue of concern arises.
- All tables will be based on number of events (presented on PT level, sorted by System
Organ Class [SOC]) and not number of cases.
- Tables 1 to 4 will be based on events reported from healthcare professionals only.
- In Tables 1 to 5, numbers will be provided for events received during the reporting
period and cumulatively.
- All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data.
Product-specific
data can be evaluated during signal work-up.
- No line listings are required – these can be provided in signal evaluation reports as
necessary.
A short summary shall also be provided with the periodic safety update reports, in which any area of concern should be highlighted, signal work-up prioritised (if the event of multiple signals) and appropriate timelines for submission of a full signal evaluation report provided.
All 12 signal evaluation reports should be provided, including those that were subsequently not identified as being signals.
A summary of vaccine distribution shall be included and provide details of the number of doses of vaccine distributed in:
i) ii) iii)
EU member states for the reporting period by batch number, EU member states cumulatively and the rest of the world
Official batch release: in accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/ 83/ EC as amended, the official batch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose.

1.
WHAT PREPANDRIX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Prepandrix is a vaccine for use in adults from 18 to 60 years old.
It is intended to be given before or during the next influenza (flu) pandemic to prevent flu caused by the H5N1 type of the virus.
Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs at intervals that vary from less than 10 years to many decades.
It spreads rapidly around the world.
The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of ordinary flu but are usually more severe.
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’ s natural defence system) will produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.
None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.
As with all vaccines, Prepandrix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.
2.
BEFORE YOU RECEIVE PREPANDRIX
Prepandrix should not be given:
• if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of Prepandrix (these are listed at the end of this leaflet) or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or sodium deoxycholate.
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.
• if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).
If this applies to you then your vaccination will be postponed until you are feeling better.
A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor will advise whether you can still be vaccinated with Prepandrix.
Take special care with Prepandrix:
• if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient contained in the vaccine, to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin
26 formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or to sodium deoxycholate.
(see section 6.
Further information). • if you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be poor. • if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses.
In the first few weeks after vaccination with Prepandrix the results of these tests may not be correct.
Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently received Prepandrix.
Using other medicines or vaccines Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine.
There are no data on the use of Prepandrix given at the same time as other vaccines.
Therefore, Prepandrix is not intended to be given at the same time as other vaccines.
However, if this cannot be avoided, the other vaccine will be injected into the other arm.
Any side effects that occur may be more severe.
If you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment (such as radiotherapy) that affects the immune system, Prepandrix can still be given but your response to the vaccine may be poor.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding There is no information on the use of Prepandrix in pregnant or breast-feeding women.
Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and potential risks of giving you the vaccine if you are pregnant or breast- feeding.
Please tell your doctor if you are/ may be pregnant or intend to become pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding and follow his advice.
Driving and using machines Some effects mentioned under section 4. “ Possible side effects” may affect the ability to drive or use machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Prepandrix Thiomersal (preservative) is present in this product, and it is possible that you may experience an allergic reaction.
