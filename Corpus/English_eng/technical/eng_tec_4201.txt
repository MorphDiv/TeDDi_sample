(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
If odbc_fetch_row() was succesful (there was a row), TRUE is returned.
If there are no more rows, FALSE is returned.
odbc_fetch_row() fetches a row of the data that was returned by odbc_do() / odbc_exec().
After odbc_fetch_row() is called, the fields of that row can be accessed with odbc_result().
If row_number is not specified, odbc_fetch_row() will try to fetch the next row in the result set.
Calls to odbc_fetch_row() with and without row_number can be mixed.
To step through the result more than once, you can call odbc_fetch_row() with row_number 1, and then continue doing odbc_fetch_row() without row_number to review the result.
If a driver doesn 't support fetching rows by number, the row_number parameter is ignored.
