can't open %s: %s
debugging output diverted to "%s"
Usage: %s [OPTION]... [MENU-ITEM...]

Read documentation in Info format.
Options:
 -a, --all use all matching manuals.
 -k, --apropos=STRING look up STRING in all indices of all manuals.
 -d, --directory=DIR add DIR to INFOPATH.
 --dribble=FILE remember user keystrokes in FILENAME.
 -f, --file=MANUAL specify Info manual to visit.
-h, --help display this help and exit.
 --index-search=STRING go to node pointed by index entry STRING.
 -n, --node=NODENAME specify nodes in first visited Info file.
 -o, --output=FILE output selected nodes to FILE.
-R, --raw-escapes output "raw" ANSI escapes (default).
 --no-raw-escapes output escapes as literal text.
 --restore=FILE read initial keystrokes from FILE.
 -O, --show-options, --usage go to command-line options node.
-b, --speech-friendly be friendly to speech synthesizers.
--strict-node-location (for debugging) use Info file pointers as-is.
 --subnodes recursively output menu items.
 -v, --variable VAR=VALUE assign VALUE to Info variable VAR.
 --vi-keys use vi-like and less-like key bindings.
 --version display version information and exit.
 -w, --where, --location print physical location of Info file.
 -x, --debug=NUMBER set debugging level (-1 for all).
The first non-option argument, if present, is the menu entry to start from;
it is searched for in all `dir' files along INFOPATH.
If it is not present, info merges all `dir' files and shows the result.
Any remaining arguments are treated as the names of menu
items relative to the initial node visited.
For a summary of key bindings, type h within Info.
Examples:
 info show top-level dir menu
 info info show the general manual for Info readers
 info info-stnd show the manual specific to this Info program
 info emacs start at emacs node from top-level dir
 info emacs buffers start at buffers node within emacs manual
 info --show-options emacs start at node with emacs' command line options
 info --subnodes -o out.txt emacs dump entire manual to out.txt
 info -f ./foo.info show file ./foo.info, not searching dir

Usage: %s [OPTION]... [INFO-FILE [DIR-FILE]]
Add or remove entries in INFO-FILE from the Info directory DIR-FILE.
INFO-FILE and DIR-FILE are required unless the --info-file
or --dir-file (or --info-dir) options are given, respectively.
Options:
 --add-once add only to first matching section, not all.
 --align=COL start description of new entries at column COL.
 --calign=COL format second and subsequent description lines to
 start at column COL.
--debug report what is being done.
 --delete delete existing entries for INFO-FILE from DIR-FILE;
 don't insert any new entries.
 --description=TEXT the description of the entry is TEXT; used with
 the --name option to become synonymous with the
 --entry option.
 --dir-file=NAME specify file name of Info directory file;
 equivalent to using the DIR-FILE argument.
 --dry-run same as --test.
--entry=TEXT insert TEXT as an Info directory entry,
 overriding any corresponding entry from DIR-FILE.
 TEXT is written as an Info menu item line followed
 by zero or more extra lines starting with whitespace.
 If you specify more than one entry, all are added.
 If you don't specify any entries, they are determined
 from information in the Info file itself.
--help display this help and exit.
 --info-dir=DIR same as --dir-file=DIR/dir.
 --info-file=FILE specify Info file to install in the directory;
 equivalent to using the INFO-FILE argument.
 --item=TEXT same as --entry=TEXT.
 --keep-old do not replace entries, or remove empty sections.
--maxwidth, --max-width=COL wrap description at column COL.
 --menuentry=TEXT same as --name=TEXT.
 --name=TEXT the name of the entry is TEXT; used with --description
 to become synonymous with the --entry option.
 --no-indent do not format new entries in the DIR file.
 --quiet suppress warnings.
--regex=R put this file's entries in all sections that match the
 regular expression R (ignoring case).
 --remove same as --delete.
 --remove-exactly only remove if the info file name matches exactly;
 suffixes such as .info and .gz are not ignored.
 --section=SEC put entries in section SEC of the directory.
 If you specify more than one section, all the entries
 are added in each of the sections.
 If you don't specify any sections, they are determined
 from information in the Info file itself.
 --section R SEC equivalent to --regex=R --section=SEC --add-once.
--silent suppress warnings.
 --test suppress updating of DIR-FILE.
 --version display version information and exit.

This is the file .../info/dir, which contains the
topmost node of the Info hierarchy, called (dir)Top.
The first time you invoke Info you start off looking at this node.
%c
%s This is the top of the INFO tree

 This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics.
 Typing "q" exits, "?" lists all Info commands, "d" returns here,
 "h" gives a primer for first-timers,
 "mEmacs<Return>" visits the Emacs manual, etc.

 In Emacs, you can click mouse button 2 on a menu item or cross reference
 to select it.

Usage: makeinfo [OPTION]... TEXINFO-FILE...
or: texi2any [OPTION]... TEXINFO-FILE...
Translate Texinfo source documentation to various other formats, by default
Info files suitable for reading online with Emacs or standalone GNU Info.
General options:
 --document-language=STR locale to use in translating Texinfo keywords
 for the output document (default C).
 --error-limit=NUM quit after NUM errors (default %d).
 --force preserve output even if errors.
 --help display this help and exit.
 --no-validate suppress node cross-reference validation.
 --no-warn suppress warnings (but not errors).
 --conf-dir=DIR search also for initialization files in DIR.
 --init-file=FILE load FILE to modify the default behavior.
 -c, --set-customization-variable VAR=VAL set customization variable VAR 
 to VAL.
 -v, --verbose explain what is being done.
 --version display version information and exit.
Output format selection (default is to produce Info):
 --docbook output Docbook XML rather than Info.
 --html output HTML rather than Info.
 --plaintext output plain text rather than Info.
 --xml output Texinfo XML rather than Info.
 --dvi, --dvipdf, --ps, --pdf call texi2dvi to generate given output.
General output options:
 -E, --macro-expand=FILE output macro-expanded source to FILE,
 ignoring any @setfilename.
 --no-headers suppress node separators, Node: lines, and menus
 from Info output (thus producing plain text)
 or from HTML (thus producing shorter output).
 Also, if producing Info, write to
 standard output by default 
 --no-split suppress any splitting of the output;
 generate only one output file.
 --[no-]number-sections output chapter and sectioning numbers;
 default is on.
 -o, --output=DEST output to DEST.
 With split output, create DEST as a directory
 and put the output files there.
 With non-split output, if DEST is already
 a directory or ends with a /,
 put the output file there.
 Otherwise, DEST names the output file.
Options for Info and plain text:
 --disable-encoding do not output accented and special characters
 in Info output based on @documentencoding.
 --enable-encoding override --disable-encoding (default).
 --fill-column=NUM break Info lines at NUM characters (default %d).
 --footnote-style=STYLE output footnotes in Info according to STYLE:
 `separate' to put them in their own node;
 `end' to put them at the end of the node, in
 which they are defined (this is the default).
 --paragraph-indent=VAL indent Info paragraphs by VAL spaces (default %d).
 If VAL is `none', do not indent; if VAL is
 `asis', preserve existing indentation.
 --split-size=NUM split Info files at size NUM (default %d).
Options for HTML:
 --css-include=FILE include FILE in HTML <style> output;
 read stdin if FILE is -.
 --css-ref=URL generate CSS reference to URL.
 --internal-links=FILE produce list of internal links in FILE.
 --split=SPLIT split at SPLIT, where SPLIT may be `chapter',
 `section' or `node'.
 --transliterate-file-names use file names in ASCII transliteration.
 --node-files produce redirection files for nodes and 
 anchors; default is set only if split.
Options for XML and Docbook:
 --output-indent=VAL does nothing, retained for compatibility.
Options for DVI/PS/PDF:
 --Xopt=OPT pass OPT to texi2dvi; can be repeated.
Input file options:
 --commands-in-node-names does nothing, retained for compatibility.
 -D VAR define the variable VAR, as with @set.
 -I DIR append DIR to the @include search path.
 -P DIR prepend DIR to the @include search path.
 -U VAR undefine the variable VAR, as with @clear.
Conditional processing in input:
 --ifdocbook process @ifdocbook and @docbook even if
 not generating Docbook.
 --ifhtml process @ifhtml and @html even if not generating HTML.
 --ifinfo process @ifinfo even if not generating Info.
 --ifplaintext process @ifplaintext even if not generating plain text.
 --iftex process @iftex and @tex.
 --ifxml process @ifxml and @xml.
 --no-ifdocbook do not process @ifdocbook and @docbook text.
 --no-ifhtml do not process @ifhtml and @html text.
 --no-ifinfo do not process @ifinfo text.
 --no-ifplaintext do not process @ifplaintext text.
 --no-iftex do not process @iftex and @tex text.
 --no-ifxml do not process @ifxml and @xml text.

 Also, for the --no-ifFORMAT options, do process @ifnotFORMAT text.
The defaults for the @if... conditionals depend on the output format:
 if generating Docbook, --ifdocbook is on and the others are off;
 if generating HTML, --ifhtml is on and the others are off;
 if generating Info, --ifinfo is on and the others are off;
 if generating plain text, --ifplaintext is on and the others are off;
 if generating XML, --ifxml is on and the others are off.
Examples:
 makeinfo foo.texi write Info to foo's @setfilename
 makeinfo --html foo.texi write HTML to @setfilename
 makeinfo --xml foo.texi write Texinfo XML to @setfilename
 makeinfo --docbook foo.texi write Docbook XML to @setfilename
 makeinfo --plaintext foo.texi write plain text to standard output
 makeinfo --pdf foo.texi write PDF using texi2dvi

 makeinfo --html --no-headers foo.texi write html without node lines, menus
 makeinfo --number-sections foo.texi write Info with numbered sections
 makeinfo --no-split foo.texi write one Info file however big
