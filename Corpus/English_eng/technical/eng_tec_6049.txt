Message Part Properties
The MIME type of the file: normally, you do not need to touch this setting, since the type of the file is automatically checked; but, sometimes, %1 may not detect the type correctly -- here is where you can fix that.
The size of the part: sometimes, %1 will only give an estimated size here, because calculating the exact size would take too much time; when this is the case, it will be made visible by adding "(est.)" to the size displayed.
& Name:
The file name of the part: although this defaults to the name of the attached file, it does not specify the file to be attached; rather, it suggests a file name to be used by the recipient's mail agent when saving the part to disk.
& Description:
A description of the part: this is just an informational description of the part, much like the Subject is for the whole message; most mail agents will show this information in their message previews alongside the attachment's icon.
& Encoding:
The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.
Suggest & automatic display
Check this option if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this part in the message preview, instead of the default icon view; technically, this is carried out by setting this part's Content-Disposition header field to "inline" instead of the default "attachment".
& Sign this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be signed; the signature will be made with the key that you associated with the currently-selected identity.
Encrypt this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted; the part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message

Some emails, especially those generated automatically, do not specify the character encoding which needs to be used to properly display them. In such cases a fallback character encoding will be used, which you can configure here. Set it to the character encoding most commonly used in your part of the world. As a default the encoding configured for the whole system is used.
Changing this from its default'Auto 'will force the use of the specified encoding for all emails, regardless of what they specify themselves.
