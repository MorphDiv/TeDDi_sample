Music Players
There are several & kde; music players with somewhat overlapping feature sets, however, each is quite different in style.
noatun;
noatun;
Noatun is the default & kde; music player. It features a highly configurable interface, including several styles of playlist manager, and many plugins to provide different & GUI; s, visualizations, and other features.
& noatun; is part of the kdemultimedia package.
juk;
juk;
& juk; is a media manager, playlist manager, and metadata tagger. It is a highly efficient way to manage all your music files, make and maintain playlists, and maintain the metadata tags in your music.
It is equally useful as your primary music player, or managing playlists and files for use in another application.
& juk; is part of the kdemultimedia package.
kaboodle;
kaboodle;
& kaboodle; is a one shot player. That means, it will run, play a file, and stop. & kaboodle; is useful for instance if you want to quickly listen to a single file without interupting your current playlist from another media player.
& kaboodle; is part of the kdemultimedia package.
amaroK
amaroK is a popular third party application. You should be able to find packages from your normal distribution source.
Most of the & kde; based movie players such as Kaffeine and kmplayer also make useful music players.
