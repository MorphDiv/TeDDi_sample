About XML Filters
stores documents in XML format
.
You can create customised filters that convert the native OpenDocument XML file format used by %PRODUCTNAME into another format.
These filters can be integrated into %PRODUCTNAME seamlessly so that you can save or load these formats transparently.
To create an XML filter, you must have a good understanding of XML and XSLT concepts.
These concepts are beyond the scope of this help.
stylesheets
that are written in the XSLT language.
The stylesheets define the transformation from the OpenDocument file format to another XML format through export and import filters.
There are three types of XML filters:
Import Filters
load external XML files and transform the format of the files into the OpenDocument XML file format.
After you install an import filter, the name of the filter is added to the list of file types in the
File Open dialogue box
.
Export Filters
transform OpenDocument XML files and
save
the files to a different XML format.
After you install an export filter, the name of the filter is added to the list of file types in the
Export dialogue box
.
Import/Export Filters
load and save OpenDocument XML files into a different XML
format
.
After you install these filters, the names of the filters are added to the list of file types in the
File Open dialogue box
and the
File Save As dialogue box
.
