& kooka; is a very useful & kde; scanning application.
KDE
Scanner
Introduction
& kooka; is a & kde; application that enables easy scanning using SANE libraries. Therefore, SANE the package must be installed to use & kooka;. Clear and concise use was the focus of its development.
Character recognition is also provided by the built-in text recognition program gocr. Install gocr to use this functionality. After character recognition is complete, the recognized material can be opened in the text editor & kate; with just one click, where you can edit the contents.
Application Instructions
The web site http: / /www. sane-project. org has information about supported scanners. Refer to it before purchasing a scanner, if possible.
The & kooka; Main Window
The & kooka; Main Window
Start & kooka; from a console by simply entering kooka. Create a link on the & kde; desktop, which uses a scanner icon, if desired.
The main window in & kooka; consists of three frames. At the top, see both icon and a menu panels. Use the mouse to enlarge or reduce the windows as needed.
The navigation window consists of two tabs, which allow you to switch between the Preview and the integrated file browser called the Gallery. The working folder is displayed in the lower part of the window along with the folder where the scan will be saved.
Make your scanner-dependent settings, which are dependent on the scanner you have connected, in the lower left window. Usually, these are settings for resolution, brightness and contrast, scanning mode (eg;, color, gray, or binary), and for gamma values.
Configure your settings here first. Afterwards, initiate the preview scan with Preview. If the Preview tab in the upper window is selected, see the results there.
Select the various formats in the preview image itself to define the final dimensions. The User setting is recommended for this, so you select the area to scan in the preview display with the mouse.
After this is done, click Scan to scan the selection made in the preview. After scanning, you will be asked in which format to save the image whether to make this your standard format (without being prompted to confirm your selection in the future).
If you checked that you do not want to be asked about the save format, the memory assistant will no longer appear. To change the format some time in the future, select Settings Configure Kooka... Save Image Always show memory assistant
The large window shows how the image appears after a final scan.

Ctrl; C Image OCR on selection...
A window will reappear for the character recognition. Here, however, the character recognition is only for the area highlighted in the final scan.

Kooka Startup Preferences
You may want to uncheck Show the scanner selection box on next startup, if you have only one scanner. If you have only one computer you may also want to uncheck Query network for available scanners.
Thumbnail View
Here the size and the shading of the thumbnails can be adjusted; as well as the background. For example, you might want to reduce the size of the thumbnails if you are scanning many pages from a book.
Save
More on Saving Images
The method for saving an image is somewhat different in & kooka; than in many other applications. Click the Gallery tab to open a small file browser. This is the folder ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ ScanImages/ In the lower portion of the window, your current subfolder in the gallery is shown. This is where all scanned images are first saved as files. When starting & kooka; for the first time, you will only see the ScanImages. Create subfolders by right clicking this folder. The selected folder, highlighted in blue, is the first save location of the scanned images. The scans are labeled in ascending numerical order as in kscan_0001 and kscan_0002.
To save an image permanently, left click the name. Next, give a new name and the appropriate ending for the image format chosen when scanning. If you enter a different extension, you will get a message that it does not correspond to the scanned format. Although you can still save the image under this name, it will retain its original format. At present, On-the-fly conversion is not offered.
If you do not want to use this method of managing your images in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ ScanImages/, you can, of course, save them to another location. To do this, right click the image name and select Save. Choose any path here. In addition, close or permanently delete images here.
To incorporate other images in the gallery, add them in & konqueror; by dragging and dropping. Open & konqueror; to the folder containing the desired images. Then add them to the & kooka; gallery by dragging them and dropping them into the gallery.
Character Recognition
As already mentioned, the gocr must be installed. Scan a preview of your document in grayscale or color. You can only scan in binary mode if you have a pure white sheet of paper with black print. Next, highlight the text to be recognized in the preview window. Then, do your final scan in binary mode with Scan.
Now click the second icon from the left,, in the icon panel, OCR on Selection..., or select this item in the Image menu. For your first try, do not change the default settings shown in the emerging OCR window. These are usually appropriate and meet most needs. Now click Start character recognition. You will now see a window containing the OCR results. The quality depends heavily on that of the document itself.
The gocr Window
The text can now be opened by clicking the button with the & kate; editor. After the final scan, mark a selection in the image display to the right to load just a part of the text or image to the OCR. Next, in the icon panel, click the third button from the right or click in the menu on OCR on selection. Now proceed as described in the previous section.
