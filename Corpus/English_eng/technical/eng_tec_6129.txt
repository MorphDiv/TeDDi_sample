Introduction
& kapplication; is a blogging client.
A blog client (also called blog software or blogware) is a software designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of weblogs. As other specialized content management systems do, weblog applications support the authoring, editing, and publishing of blog posts and comments, with special functions for image management, web syndication, and moderation of posts and comments.
Using & kapplication;
Getting started
In & kapplication; main window, you can create new posts, modify previous ones, remove them from the server as well as upload media files to the server. You can also save posts locally for later use.
All of these will be available after you configure at least one blog in & kapplication;.
Without any configured blog you can write and save some posts locally for later use.
Here's a screenshot of & kapplication;
Main Window
Configuring a blog
Blog management is available in the Configure & kapplication; dialog, and is accessible via Settings Configure & kapplication;... menu. Also there is a shortcut for it in the main window in Blog Add Blog... menu.
Add a new blog - Basic tab
Add a new blog - Basic tab
To add a blog, you simply have to insert your blog address, username and password in the corresponding fields and then click the Auto Configure button for the most famous blogging servers such as Wordpress. It will guess your blog, and api, and then will fetch your BlogId.
And if it fails, you can manually select your blog's API type in the Advanced tab and click Fetch ID to fetch id, or enter your Blog id, if you know it. And if you are using a“ right to left ” language, select Right To Left in next combo box.

Creating a new Post
To create a new post, in main window, you can click on New Post toolbar button or under Post menu, or simply press Ctrl; N (its shortcut).
A new/ empty post is created, and you can write, and configure it, and then submit it to your blog.
The & kapplication; main window is divided into two sections, Composer and Toolbox.
Composer
In the Composer section, you have a text field with the label Title, where you can write the title of the post. Below it, you have 3 tabs to edit your post in several ways. The first is a Visual Editor: it is a WYSWIG editor and you only need to use the icons to format your text. Next tab is a & HTML; editor, where you have a text editor to edit & HTML; code of your post, with a syntax highlighted editor. And on last tab, you can view your post with your blog style, before submitting it to the server.
Toolbox
The Toolbox has four sections:
Blog Posts
Blog Posts
Blog Posts
In this section, you can fetch the latest posts from the server.
Double click on a post entry to load it into the composer and modify it or remove a post from the server.

And in the Local Entries section, you can double click on an entry to load it into composer, or remove it from disk.
Uploading a Media file to the server
To upload a file to the server, use Blog Upload Media... then you are asked to select a file from your disk. Then the media upload dialog will be ready to upload it:
Upload Media
Upload Media
If your blog API supports media uploading, you have 2 options here, and if not, there is just one and it's & FTP; server.
You can preview your desired file here (if it has any way to preview), and select its name on the server. And then click Upload.
If you want to upload to a & FTP; server, the absolute path of the folder is required. And you have to enter a & URL; to use for guessing the link of the file on the server.
