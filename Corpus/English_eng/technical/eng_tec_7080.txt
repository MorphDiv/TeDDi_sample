Where to position newly open tabs in browser windows.
If set to "after-current-tab", then new tabs are inserted after the current tab. If set to "end", then new tabs are appended to the end of the tab list.
Enables the classic Nautilus behavior, where all windows are browsers
If set to true, then all Nautilus windows will be browser windows. This is how Nautilus used to behave before version 2.6, and some people prefer this behavior.
Always use the location entry, instead of the pathbar
If set to true, then Nautilus browser windows will always use a textual input entry for the location toolbar, instead of the pathbar.
Whether to ask for confirmation when deleting files, or emptying Trash
If set to true, then Nautilus will ask for confirmation when you attempt to delete files, or empty the Trash.
Whether to enable immediate deletion
If set to true, then Nautilus will have a feature allowing you to delete a file immediately and in-place, instead of moving it to the trash. This feature can be dangerous, so use caution.
When to show preview text in icons
Speed tradeoff for when to show a preview of text file contents in the file's icon. If set to "always" then always show previews, even if the folder is on a remote server. If set to "local-only" then only show previews for local file systems. If set to "never" then never bother to read preview data.
When to show number of items in a folder
Speed tradeoff for when to show the number of items in a folder. If set to "always" then always show item counts, even if the folder is on a remote server. If set to "local-only" then only show counts for local file systems. If set to "never" then never bother to compute item counts.
Type of click used to launch/open files
Possible values are "single" to launch files on a single click, or "double" to launch them on a double click.
What to do with executable text files when activated
What to do with executable text files when they are activated (single or double clicked). Possible values are "launch" to launch them as programs, "ask" to ask what to do via a dialog, and "display" to display them as text files.
Show the package installer for unknown mime types
Whether to show the user a package installer dialog in case an unknown mime type is opened, in order to search for an application to handle it.
Use extra mouse button events in Nautilus' browser window
For users with mice that have "Forward" and "Back" buttons, this key will determine if any action is taken inside of Nautilus when either is pressed.
Mouse button to activate the "Forward" command in browser window
For users with mice that have buttons for "Forward" and "Back", this key will set which button activates the "Forward" command in a browser window. Possible values range between 6 and 14.
Mouse button to activate the "Back" command in browser window
For users with mice that have buttons for "Forward" and "Back", this key will set which button activates the "Back" command in a browser window. Possible values range between 6 and 14.
When to show thumbnails of image files
Speed tradeoff for when to show an image file as a thumbnail. If set to "always" then always thumbnail, even if the folder is on a remote server. If set to "local-only" then only show thumbnails for local file systems. If set to "never" then never bother to thumbnail images, just use a generic icon.
Maximum image size for thumbnailing
Images over this size (in bytes) won't be thumbnailed. The purpose of this setting is to avoid thumbnailing large images that may take a long time to load or use lots of memory.
Show advanced permissions in the file property dialog
If set to true, then Nautilus lets you edit and display file permissions in a more unix-like way, accessing some more esoteric options.
Show folders first in windows
If set to true, then Nautilus shows folders prior to showing files in the icon and list views.
Default sort order
The default sort-order for items in the icon view. Possible values are "name", "size", "type" and "mtime".
Reverse sort order in new windows
If true, files in new windows will be sorted in reverse order. ie, if sorted by name, then instead of sorting the files from "a" to "z", they will be sorted from "z" to "a"; if sorted by size, instead of being incrementally they will be sorted decrementally.
Nautilus uses the users home folder as the desktop
If set to true, then Nautilus will use the user's home folder as the desktop. If it is false, then it will use ~/Desktop as the desktop.
Default folder viewer
When a folder is visited this viewer is used unless you have selected another view for that particular folder. Possible values are "list-view", "icon-view" and "compact-view".
Date Format
The format of file dates. Possible values are "locale", "iso", and "informal".
Whether to show hidden files
If set to true, then hidden files are shown by default in the file manager. Hidden files are either dotfiles, listed in the folder's .hidden file or backup files ending with a tilde (~).
Bulk rename utility
If set, Nautilus will append URIs of selected files and treat the result as a command line for bulk renaming. Bulk rename applications can register themselves in this key by setting the key to a space-separated string of their executable name and any command line options. If the executable name is not set to a full path, it will be searched for in the search path.
List of possible captions on icons
A list of captions below an icon in the icon view and the desktop. The actual number of captions shown depends on the zoom level. Some possible values are: "size", "type", "date_modified", "date_changed", "date_accessed", "owner", "group", "permissions", "octal_permissions" and "mime_type".
Put labels beside icons
If true, labels will be placed beside icons rather than underneath them.
Default icon zoom level
Default zoom level used by the icon view.
Default Thumbnail Icon Size
The default size of an icon for a thumbnail in the icon view.
Text Ellipsis Limit
A string specifying how parts of overlong file names should be replaced by ellipses, depending on the zoom level. Each of the list entries is of the form "Zoom Level:Integer". For each specified zoom level, if the given integer is larger than 0, the file name will not exceed the given number of lines. If the integer is 0 or smaller, no limit is imposed on the specified zoom level. A default entry of the form "Integer" without any specified zoom level is also allowed. It defines the maximum number of lines for all other zoom levels. Examples: 0 - always display overlong file names; 3 - shorten file names if they exceed three lines; smallest:5,smaller:4,0 - shorten file names if they exceed five lines for zoom level "smallest". Shorten file names if they exceed four lines for zoom level "smaller". Do not shorten file names for other zoom levels. Available zoom levels: smallest (33%), smaller (50%), small (66%), standard (100%), large (150%), larger (200%), largest (400%)

All executable files in this folder will appear in the Scripts menu. Choosing a script from the menu will run that script.

When executed from a local folder, scripts will be passed the selected file names. When executed from a remote folder (e.g. a folder showing web or ftp content), scripts will be passed no parameters.

In all cases, the following environment variables will be set by Nautilus, which the scripts may use:

NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS: newline-delimited paths for selected files (only if local)

NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_URIS: newline-delimited URIs for selected files

NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_CURRENT_URI: URI for current location

NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_WINDOW_GEOMETRY: position and size of current window

NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_NEXT_PANE_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS: newline-delimited paths for selected files in the inactive pane of a split-view window (only if local)

NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_NEXT_PANE_SELECTED_URIS: newline-delimited URIs for selected files in the inactive pane of a split-view window

NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_NEXT_PANE_CURRENT_URI: URI for current location in the inactive pane of a split-view window
