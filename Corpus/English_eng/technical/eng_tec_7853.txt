4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
M-M-RVAXPRO is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella in individuals 12 months or older (see section 4.2).
For use in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or, for use in previously unvaccinated children older than 12 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella, see section 5.1.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Posology
M-M-RVAXPRO is to be used on the basis of official recommendations.
2 Individuals 12 months or older
Individuals 12 months or older should receive one dose at an elected date.
A second dose may be administered at least 4 weeks after the first dose in accordance with official recommendation.
The second dose is intended for individuals who did not respond to the first dose for any reason.
Infants between 6 months and less than 12 months
No data on the efficacy and safety of M-M-RVAXPRO for use in children below 12 months are currently available (see section 5.1).
Infants between 6 months and less than 12 months vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine during measles outbreak or vaccinated at that age in accordance with official recommendation may fail to respond to the vaccine due to the presence of circulating antibodies of maternal origin.
Such infants should be revaccinated at 12 to 15 months followed by an additional dose with a measles-containing vaccine according to the official recommendations.
Method of administration
The vaccine is to be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC).
The preferred injection sites are the anterolateral area of the thigh in younger children and the deltoid area in older children, adolescents, and adults.
The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.
See section 6.6 for preparation instructions.
DO NOT INJECT INTRAVASCULARLY.
4.3 Contraindications
History of hypersensitivity to any measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine, or to any of the excipients, including neomycin (see sections 2, 4.4, and 6.1).
Pregnancy (see also sections 4.4 and 4.6).
Vaccination should be postponed during any illness with fever > 38.5°C.
Active untreated tuberculosis (see section 4.4).
Blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the haematopoietic and lymphatic systems.
Current immunosuppressive therapy (including high doses of corticosteroids).
M-M-RVAXPRO is not contraindicated in individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e. g. for asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).
Humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, including hypogammaglobulinemia and dysgammaglobulinemia and AIDS, or symptomatic HIV infection or an age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage < 25% (see section 4.4).
In severely immunocompromised individuals
3 inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported.
Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.
Adults and adolescents with a history of allergies may potentially be at increased risk of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions.
Close monitoring is recommended following vaccination for the early signs of such reactions.
Since live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture, persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e. g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions.
The potential risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases.
Due caution should be employed in administration of M-M-RVAXPRO to persons with individual or family history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury.
The physician should be alert to the temperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8).
The vaccine contains 1.9 mg of sucrose as an excipient.
This amount is too low to cause adverse events in patients with rare hereditary problems such as fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency.
The vaccine contains residual traces of recombinant human albumin (rHA).
In a study with children receiving a second dose of M-M-RVAXPRO, sensitisation to rHA was not observed.
A theoretical risk of hypersensitivity to rHA at a low frequency cannot be ruled out.
Therefore caution needs to be exercised when using any product containing rHA in individuals who previously showed signs of hypersensitivity to rHA.
Pregnancy The vaccine should not be administered to pregnant females; furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months following vaccination (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).
Thrombocytopenia This vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.
Individuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe thrombocytopenia following vaccination.
In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia with the first dose of M-M-RVAXPRO (or its component vaccines) may develop thrombocytopenia with repeat doses.
Serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of vaccine are needed.
The potential risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases (see section 4.8).
4 Other Individuals who are known to be infected with human immunodeficiency viruses and are not immunocompromised may be vaccinated.
However, these vaccinees should be monitored closely for measles, mumps, and rubella because vaccination may be less effective in these patients than in persons not infected with human immunodeficiency viruses (see section 4.3).
Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not experienced exacerbation of the disease when vaccinated with live measles virus vaccine; no studies have been reported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis (see section 4.3).
As for any vaccine, vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO may not result in protection in all vaccinees.
Transmission Excretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in the majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination.
There is no confirmed evidence to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated individuals.
Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a theoretical possibility, is not regarded as a significant risk; however, transmission of the rubella vaccine virus to infants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease (see section 4.6).
There are no reports of transmission of the more attenuated Enders’ Edmonston strain of measles virus or the Jeryl Lynn ™ strain of mumps virus from vaccinees to susceptible contacts.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Immune globulin (IG) is not to be given concomitantly with M-M-RVAXPRO.
Administration of immune globulins concomitantly with M-M-RVAXPRO may interfere with the expected immune response.
Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or administration of human immune serum globulin.
Administration of measles, mumps, or rubella antibody-containing blood products, including immune globulin preparations, should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of M-M-RVAXPRO unless considered to be essential.
It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccines given individually may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity.
Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to be done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO.
Use with other vaccines Published clinical data support concomitant administration of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. with other childhood vaccinations, including DTaP (or DTwP), IPV (or OPV), HIB (Haemophilus influenzae type b), HIB-HBV (Haemophilus influenzae type b with Hepatitis B vaccine), and VAR (varicella).
Currently no specific studies have been conducted on the concomitant use of M-M-RVAXPRO and other vaccines.
However, since M-M-RVAXPRO has been shown to have safety and immunogenicity profiles similar to the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps,
5 and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., experience with this vaccine can be considered.
M-M-RVAXPRO should be given concomitantly at separate injection sites, or one month before or after administration of other live virus vaccines.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Studies have not been conducted with M-M-RVAXPRO in pregnant women.
It is not known whether M-M-RVAXPRO can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.
Therefore, the vaccine should not be administered to pregnant females; furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months following vaccination (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
In order to advise women who are inadvertently vaccinated when pregnant or who become pregnant within 3 months of vaccination, the physician should be aware of the following:
(1) In a 10 year survey involving over 700 pregnant women who received rubella vaccine within 3 months before or after conception (of whom 189 received the Wistar RA 27/ 3 strain), none of the newborns had abnormalities compatible with congenital rubella syndrome; (2) Mumps infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the rate of spontaneous abortion.
Although mumps vaccine virus has been shown to infect the placenta and foetus, there is no evidence that it causes congenital malformations in humans; and (3) Reports have indicated that contracting wild-type measles during pregnancy enhances foetal risk.
Increased rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, congenital defects, and prematurity have been observed subsequent to wild-type measles during pregnancy.
There are no adequate studies of the attenuated (vaccine) strain of measles virus in pregnancy.
However, it would be prudent to assume that the vaccine strain of virus is also capable of inducing adverse foetal effects.
Note:
Official recommendations may vary regarding the duration of the waiting period that is recommended for avoiding pregnancy following vaccination.
Postpartum Women It has been found convenient in many instances to vaccinate rubella-susceptible women in the immediate postpartum period.
Studies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella vaccines may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants.
In the infants with serological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease.
It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when M-M-RVAXPRO is administered to a breast-feeding woman.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In clinical trials, M-M-RVAXPRO was administered to 1965 children (see section 5.1), and the general safety profile was comparable to the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.
In a clinical trial, 752 children received M-M-RVAXPRO, either intramuscularly or subcutaneously.
The general safety profile of either administration routes were comparable,
6 although injection-site reactions were less frequent in the IM group (15.8%) compared with the SC group (25.8%).
All adverse reactions were evaluated in 1940 children.
Among these children, the following vaccine-related adverse reactions were observed in individuals following vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO (excluding isolated reports with frequency < 0.2%).
In comparison to the first dose, a second dose of M-M-RVAXPRO is not associated with an increase in the incidence and severity of clinical symptoms including those suggestive of hypersensitivity reaction.
Additionally, other adverse experiences reported with post-marketing use of M-M-RVAXPRO and/ or in clinical studies and post-marketing use of previous formulations of monovalent and of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. without regard to causality or frequency are available and are summarised below (frequency not known).
These data were reported based on more than 400 million doses distributed worldwide.
[Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to ≤ 1/ 100); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)]
Infections and infestations Uncommon: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection or viral infection Not known: aseptic meningitis (see below), atypical measles, epididymitis, orchitis, otitis media, parotitis, rhinitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (see below)
Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination.
Although a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has been shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn™ mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis.
Blood and the lymphatic system disorders Not known: regional lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia
Immune system disorders Not known: anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis and related phenomenon such as angioneurotic oedema, facial oedema, and peripheral oedema
Psychiatric disorders Not known: irritability
Nervous system disorders Not known: afebrile convulsions or seizures, ataxia, dizziness, encephalitis (see below), encephalopathy (see below), febrile convulsion (in children), Guillain-Barre syndrome, headache, measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) (see section 4.3), ocular palsies, optic neuritis, paraesthesia, polyneuritis, polyneuropathy, retrobulbar neuritis, syncope
Encephalitis and encephalopathy, excluding subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), have been reported approximately once for every 3 million doses of the measles-containing vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.
Post-marketing surveillance of the more than 400 million doses that have been distributed worldwide over nearly 25 years (1978-2003) indicates that serious adverse events such as encephalitis and encephalopathy continue to be rarely reported.
In
7 no case has it been shown conclusively that reactions were actually caused by vaccine; however, the data suggest the possibility that some of these cases may have been caused by measles vaccines.
There is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause SSPE.
There have been reports of SSPE in children who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles vaccine.
Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination.
The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the overall effect of measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE.
Eye disorders Not known: conjunctivitis, retinitis
Ear and labyrinth disorders Not known: nerve deafness
Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders Uncommon: rhinorrhoea Not known: bronchial spasm, cough, pneumonia, pneumonitis (see section 4.3), sore throat
Gastrointestinal disorders Uncommon: diarrhoea or vomiting Not known: nausea
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common: rash morbilliform or other rash Uncommon: urticaria Not known: panniculitis, purpura, skin induration, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pruritus
Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders Not known: arthritis and/ or arthralgia (usually transient and rarely chronic [see below]), myalgia
Arthralgia and/ or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of infection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in adult females and least in prepubertal children.
Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints are generally uncommon (0-3%) and of brief duration.
In women, incidence rates for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12-20%), and the reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration.
Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare occasions for years.
In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in children and adult women.
Even in older women (35-45 years), these reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.
Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent virus and/ or viral antigen isolated from body tissues.
Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed chronic joint symptoms.
8 General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: fever (38.5°C or higher), injection site erythema, injection site pain, and injection site swelling Common: injection site bruising Uncommon: injection site rash Not known: burning and/ or stinging of short duration at the injection site, fever (38.5°C or higher), malaise, papillitis, peripheral oedema, swelling, tenderness, vesicles at the injection site, wheal and flare at the injection site
Vascular disorders Not known: vasculitis
4.9 Overdose
Overdose has been reported rarely and was not associated with any serious adverse reactions.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Viral vaccine, ATC code J07BD52
Evaluation of immunogenicity and clinical efficacy A comparative study in 1279 subjects who received M-M-RVAXPRO or the previous formulation (manufactured with human serum albumin) of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. demonstrated similar immunogenicity and safety between the 2 products.
Clinical studies of 284 triple seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of age, demonstrated that the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. is highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated.
In these studies, a single injection of the vaccine induced measles hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies in 95%, mumps neutralising antibodies in 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 99% of susceptible persons.
A comparative study in 752 subjects who received M-M-RVAXPRO either by intramuscular route or subcutaneous route demonstrated a similar immunogenicity profile between both administration routes.
The efficacy of the components of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. was established in a series of double-blind controlled field trials, which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy afforded by the individual vaccine components.
These studies also established that seroconversion in response to vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella paralleled protection from these diseases.
Post-exposure vaccination Vaccination of individuals exposed to wild-type measles may provide some protection if the vaccine can be administered within 72 hours after exposure.
If, however, the vaccine is given a few days before exposure, substantial protection may be afforded.
There is no conclusive evidence that vaccination of individuals recently exposed to wild-type mumps or wild-type rubella will provide protection.
9 Effectiveness More than 400 million doses of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2003).
Widespread use of a 2-dose vaccination schedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has led to a > 99% reduction in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases.
Non-pregnant adolescent and adult females Vaccination of susceptible non-pregnant adolescent and adult females of childbearing age with live attenuated rubella virus vaccine is indicated if certain precautions are observed (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
Vaccinating susceptible postpubertal females confers individual protection against subsequently acquiring rubella infection during pregnancy, which, in turn, prevents infection of the foetus and consequent congenital rubella injury.
Previously unvaccinated children older than 12 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women should receive live attenuated rubella-containing vaccine (such as M-M-RVAXPRO or a monovalent rubella vaccine) to reduce the risk of exposure of the pregnant woman.
Individuals likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella M-M-RVAXPRO is preferred for vaccination of persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.
Individuals who require vaccination against measles can receive M-M-RVAXPRO regardless of their immune status to mumps or rubella if a monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Traditional non-clinical studies were not performed, but there are no non-clinical concerns considered relevant to clinical safety beyond data included in other sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics.

14 inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported.
Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.
Adults and adolescents with a history of allergies may potentially be at increased risk of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions.
Close monitoring is recommended following vaccination for the early signs of such reactions.
Since live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture, persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e. g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions.
The potential risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases.
Due caution should be employed in administration of M-M-RVAXPRO to persons with individual or family history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury.
The physician should be alert to the temperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8).
The vaccine contains 1.9 mg of sucrose as an excipient.
This amount is too low to cause adverse events in patients with rare hereditary problems such as fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency.

The potential risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases (see section 4.8).
15 Other Individuals who are known to be infected with human immunodeficiency viruses and are not immunocompromised may be vaccinated.
However, these vaccinees should be monitored closely for measles, mumps, and rubella because vaccination may be less effective in these patients than in persons not infected with human immunodeficiency viruses (see section 4.3).
Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not experienced exacerbation of the disease when vaccinated with live measles virus vaccine; no studies have been reported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis (see section 4.3).
As for any vaccine, vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO may not result in protection in all vaccinees.
Transmission Excretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in the majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination.
There is no confirmed evidence to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated individuals.
Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a theoretical possibility, is not regarded as a significant risk; however, transmission of the rubella vaccine virus to infants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease (see section 4.6).
There are no reports of transmission of the more attenuated Enders’ Edmonston strain of measles virus or the Jeryl Lynn ™ strain of mumps virus from vaccinees to susceptible contacts.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Immune globulin (IG) is not to be given concomitantly with M-M-RVAXPRO.
Administration of immune globulins concomitantly with M-M-RVAXPRO may interfere with the expected immune response.
Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or administration of human immune serum globulin.
Administration of measles, mumps, or rubella antibody-containing blood products, including immune globulin preparations, should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of M-M-RVAXPRO unless considered to be essential.
It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccines given individually may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity.
Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to be done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO.
Use with other vaccines Published clinical data support concomitant administration of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. with other childhood vaccinations, including DTaP (or DTwP), IPV (or OPV), HIB (Haemophilus influenzae type b), HIB-HBV (Haemophilus influenzae type b with Hepatitis B vaccine), and VAR (varicella).
Currently no specific studies have been conducted on the concomitant use of M-M-RVAXPRO and other vaccines.
However, since M-M-RVAXPRO has been shown to have safety and immunogenicity profiles similar to the previous formulation of the combined measles, mumps,
16 and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., experience with this vaccine can be considered.
M-M-RVAXPRO should be given concomitantly at separate injection sites, or one month before or after administration of other live virus vaccines.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Studies have not been conducted with M-M-RVAXPRO in pregnant women.
It is not known whether M-M-RVAXPRO can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.
Therefore, the vaccine should not be administered to pregnant females; furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months following vaccination (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
In order to advise women who are inadvertently vaccinated when pregnant or who become pregnant within 3 months of vaccination, the physician should be aware of the following:
(1) In a 10 year survey involving over 700 pregnant women who received rubella vaccine within 3 months before or after conception (of whom 189 received the Wistar RA 27/ 3 strain), none of the newborns had abnormalities compatible with congenital rubella syndrome; (2) Mumps infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the rate of spontaneous abortion.
Although mumps vaccine virus has been shown to infect the placenta and foetus, there is no evidence that it causes congenital malformations in humans; and (3) Reports have indicated that contracting wild-type measles during pregnancy enhances foetal risk.
Increased rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, congenital defects, and prematurity have been observed subsequent to wild-type measles during pregnancy.
There are no adequate studies of the attenuated (vaccine) strain of measles virus in pregnancy.
However, it would be prudent to assume that the vaccine strain of virus is also capable of inducing adverse foetal effects.
Note:
Official recommendations may vary regarding the duration of the waiting period that is recommended for avoiding pregnancy following vaccination.
Postpartum Women It has been found convenient in many instances to vaccinate rubella-susceptible women in the immediate postpartum period.
Studies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella vaccines may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants.
In the infants with serological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease.
It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when M-M-RVAXPRO is administered to a breast-feeding woman.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In clinical trials, M-M-RVAXPRO was administered to 1965 children (see section 5.1), and the general safety profile was comparable to the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.
In a clinical trial, 752 children received M-M-RVAXPRO, either intramuscularly or subcutaneously.
The general safety profile of either administration routes were comparable,
17 although injection-site reactions were less frequent in the IM group (15.8%) compared with the SC group (25.8%).
All adverse reactions were evaluated in 1940 children.
Among these children, the following vaccine-related adverse reactions were observed in individuals following vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO (excluding isolated reports with frequency < 0.2%).
In comparison to the first dose, a second dose of M-M-RVAXPRO is not associated with an increase in the incidence and severity of clinical symptoms including those suggestive of hypersensitivity reaction.
Additionally, other adverse experiences reported with post-marketing use of M-M-RVAXPRO and/ or in clinical studies and post-marketing use of previous formulations of monovalent and of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. without regard to causality or frequency are available and are summarised below (frequency not known).
These data were reported based on more than 400 million doses distributed worldwide.
[Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to ≤ 1/ 100); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)]
Infections and infestations Uncommon: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection or viral infection Not known: aseptic meningitis (see below), atypical measles, epididymitis, orchitis, otitis media, parotitis, rhinitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (see below)
Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination.
Although a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has been shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn™ mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis.
Blood and the lymphatic system disorders Not known: regional lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia
Immune system disorders Not known: anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis and related phenomenon such as angioneurotic oedema, facial oedema, and peripheral oedema
Psychiatric disorders Not known: irritability
Nervous system disorders Not known: afebrile convulsions or seizures, ataxia, dizziness, encephalitis (see below), encephalopathy (see below), febrile convulsion (in children), Guillain-Barre syndrome, headache, measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) (see section 4.3), ocular palsies, optic neuritis, paraesthesia, polyneuritis, polyneuropathy, retrobulbar neuritis, syncope
Encephalitis and encephalopathy, excluding subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), have been reported approximately once for every 3 million doses of the measles-containing vaccines manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.
Post-marketing surveillance of the more than 400 million doses that have been distributed worldwide over nearly 25 years (1978-2003) indicates that serious adverse events such as encephalitis and encephalopathy continue to be rarely reported.
In
18 no case has it been shown conclusively that reactions were actually caused by vaccine; however, the data suggest the possibility that some of these cases may have been caused by measles vaccines.
There is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause SSPE.
There have been reports of SSPE in children who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles vaccine.
Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination.
The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the overall effect of measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE.
Eye disorders Not known: conjunctivitis, retinitis
Ear and labyrinth disorders Not known: nerve deafness
Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders Uncommon: rhinorrhoea Not known: bronchial spasm, cough, pneumonia, pneumonitis (see section 4.3), sore throat
Gastrointestinal disorders Uncommon: diarrhoea or vomiting Not known: nausea
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common: rash morbilliform or other rash Uncommon: urticaria Not known: panniculitis, purpura, skin induration, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pruritus
Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders Not known: arthritis and/ or arthralgia (usually transient and rarely chronic [see below]), myalgia
Arthralgia and/ or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of infection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in adult females and least in prepubertal children.
Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints are generally uncommon (0-3%) and of brief duration.
In women, incidence rates for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12-20%), and the reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration.
Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare occasions for years.
In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in children and adult women.
Even in older women (35-45 years), these reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.
Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent virus and/ or viral antigen isolated from body tissues.
Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed chronic joint symptoms.
19 General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: fever (38.5°C or higher), injection site erythema, injection site pain, and injection site swelling Common: injection site bruising Uncommon: injection site rash Not known: burning and/ or stinging of short duration at the injection site, fever (38.5°C or higher), malaise, papillitis, peripheral oedema, swelling, tenderness, vesicles at the injection site, wheal and flare at the injection site
Vascular disorders Not known: vasculitis
4.9 Overdose
Overdose has been reported rarely and was not associated with any serious adverse reactions.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Viral vaccine, ATC code J07BD52
Evaluation of immunogenicity and clinical efficacy A comparative study in 1279 subjects who received M-M-RVAXPRO or the previous formulation (manufactured with human serum albumin) of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. demonstrated similar immunogenicity and safety between the 2 products.
Clinical studies of 284 triple seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of age, demonstrated that the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. is highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated.
In these studies, a single injection of the vaccine induced measles hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies in 95%, mumps neutralising antibodies in 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 99% of susceptible persons.
A comparative study in 752 subjects who received M-M-RVAXPRO either by intramuscular route or subcutaneous route demonstrated a similar immunogenicity profile between both administration routes.
The efficacy of the components of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. was established in a series of double-blind controlled field trials, which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy afforded by the individual vaccine components.
These studies also established that seroconversion in response to vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella paralleled protection from these diseases.
Post-exposure vaccination Vaccination of individuals exposed to wild-type measles may provide some protection if the vaccine can be administered within 72 hours after exposure.
If, however, the vaccine is given a few days before exposure, substantial protection may be afforded.
There is no conclusive evidence that vaccination of individuals recently exposed to wild-type mumps or wild-type rubella will provide protection.
20 Effectiveness More than 400 million doses of the previous formulation of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2003).
Widespread use of a 2-dose vaccination schedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has led to a > 99% reduction in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases.
Non-pregnant adolescent and adult females Vaccination of susceptible non-pregnant adolescent and adult females of childbearing age with live attenuated rubella virus vaccine is indicated if certain precautions are observed (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
Vaccinating susceptible postpubertal females confers individual protection against subsequently acquiring rubella infection during pregnancy, which, in turn, prevents infection of the foetus and consequent congenital rubella injury.
Previously unvaccinated children older than 12 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women should receive live attenuated rubella-containing vaccine (such as M-M-RVAXPRO or a monovalent rubella vaccine) to reduce the risk of exposure of the pregnant woman.
Individuals likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella M-M-RVAXPRO is preferred for vaccination of persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.
Individuals who require vaccination against measles can receive M-M-RVAXPRO regardless of their immune status to mumps or rubella if a monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Traditional non-clinical studies were not performed, but there are no non-clinical concerns considered relevant to clinical safety beyond data included in other sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Further information
1.
WHAT M-M-RVAXPRO IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
M-M-RVAXPRO is a vaccine containing measles, mumps, and rubella viruses that have been weakened.
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defences) will make antibodies against the measles, mumps, and rubella viruses.
The antibodies help protect against infections caused by these viruses.
M-M-RVAXPRO is given to help protect you or your child against measles, mumps, and rubella.
The vaccine may be administered to persons 12 months or older.
M-M-RVAXPRO can also be used in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or for use in previously unvaccinated children older than 12 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women, and persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella.
Although M-M-RVAXPRO contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, or rubella in healthy people.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE M-M-RVAXPRO
Do not use M-M-RVAXPRO
- If you or your child are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the components of
M-M-RVAXPRO (including neomycin or any of the ingredients listed under “ other ingredients”.
See section 6.
Further information)
- If you or your child are pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months
after vaccination, see Pregnancy)
- If you or your child have active untreated tuberculosis
48
- If you or your child are receiving treatment or taking medicines that may weaken the
immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy)
- If you or your child have a weakened immune system because of a disease (including
AIDS)
- If you or your child have a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the immune
system
- If you or your child have a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency,
unless the immune competence of you or your child is demonstrated.
- If you or your child have any illness with fever higher than 38.5°C; however, low-grade
fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination
Take special care with M-M-RVAXPRO If the person to be vaccinated has experienced any of the following, talk to the doctor or pharmacist before M-M-RVAXPRO is given:
- If you or your child have an allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg
- If you or your child have a history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits)
- If you or your child have a side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps, or rubella
vaccine (in a single component vaccine or a combination vaccine, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.) that involved easy bruising or bleeding for longer than usual
- If you or your child have infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) but do not
show symptoms of HIV disease.
You or your child should be monitored closely for measles, mumps, and rubella because vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see section Do not use M-M-RVAXPRO).
As with other vaccines, M-M-RVAXPRO may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated.
Also, if the person who is to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, or rubella virus but is not yet ill, M-M-RVAXPRO may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.
M-M-RVAXPRO can be given to persons who have been in recent (within 3 days) contact with a case of measles and may be incubating the disease.
However, M-M-RVAXPRO may not always be able to prevent measles developing in these cases.
Using other medicines and other vaccines The doctor may delay your or your child’ s vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or immune globulin (known as IG).
After vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO, IG should not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.
If a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with, or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-RVAXPRO.
M-M-RVAXPRO may be given with some routine childhood vaccines that may be due to be given at the same time.
For vaccines that cannot be given at the same time, M-M-RVAXPRO should be given 1 month before or after administration of those vaccines.
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you or your child are taking or have recently taken any other medicines (or other vaccines), including medicines obtained without a prescription.
49 Pregnancy and breast-feeding M-M-RVAXPRO must not be given to pregnant females.
Females of child-bearing age should take the necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 3 months, or according to doctor’ s recommendation, after they have been given the vaccine.
Persons who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor.
The doctor will decide if M-M-RVAXPRO should be given.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines There is no information to suggest that M-M-RVAXPRO affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.
3.
HOW TO USE M-M-RVAXPRO
M-M-RVAXPRO should be injected into the muscle or under the skin either in the area of the outer thigh or of the upper arm.
Usually for injections into the muscle the thigh area is preferred in young children whereas for older individuals the upper arm area is the preferred injection site.
M-M-RVAXPRO is not to be injected directly into any blood vessel.
M-M-RVAXPRO is given as follows:
- To persons 12 months or older.
One dose is given at an elected date.
- For persons vaccinated at 12 months or older, an additional dose is usually recommended
at least 4 weeks after the first dose according to your doctor’ s recommendation.
- Children first vaccinated between 6 months and less than 12 months should be revaccinated
at 12 to 15 months followed by an additional dose according to your doctor’ s recommendation.
Reconstitution instructions intended for medical and healthcare professionals are included at the end of the leaflet.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, M-M-RVAXPRO can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Approximately 1 out of 10 patients reported the following side effects with the use of M-M-RVAXPRO: fever (38.5°C or higher), injection site redness, and injection site pain and swelling.
Injection site bruising was reported in approximately 1 out of 100 patients.
Other side effects have been reported with the use of either the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. or of its monovalent (single) components: burning and/ or stinging of short duration at the injection site, joint pain and/ or swelling (which could be transient or chronic), rash, unusual bleeding or bruising under the skin, and swelling of the testicles.
Other less common side effects have been reported and some of these were serious.
These included: allergic reactions, seizures (fits), and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).
50 The doctor has a more complete list of side effects for M-M-RVAXPRO.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.
If the condition persists or worsens, seek medical attention.
5.
HOW TO STORE M-M-RVAXPRO
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Store and transport refrigerated (2°C- 8°C).
Keep the vial of powder in the outer carton in order to protect from light.
Do not freeze the vaccine.
Do not use M-M-RVAXPRO after the expiry date which is stated on the outer carton after EXP.

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
Reconstitution instructions The solvent is a clear colourless liquid.
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder is a light yellow compact crystalline cake.
When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear yellow liquid.
Inject the entire content of the pre-filled syringe into the vial containing the powder.
Gently agitate to dissolve completely.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine vial into the same syringe and inject the entire volume.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution or stored in the refrigerator and used within 8 hours to minimize loss of potency.
Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 8 hours.
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Do not use the reconstituted vaccine if you notice any particulate matter or if the appearance of the solvent or powder or of the reconstituted vaccine differs from that described above.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
