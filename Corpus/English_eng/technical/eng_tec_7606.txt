EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
NOVEM
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Novem?
Novem is a solution for injection, which comes in two strengths:
5 mg/ ml and 20 mg/ ml.
What is Novem used for?
Novem is used to relieve inflammation and pain in both acute and chronic musculo-skeletal disorders.
Novem is used in cattle for acute respiratory infection with appropriate antibiotic therapy to reduce clinical signs.
It is also used for diarrhoea in combination with oral re-hydration therapy to reduce clinical signs in calves of over one week of age and young, non-lactating cattle; and also as supportive therapy in the treatment of acute mastitis, in combination with antibiotics.
In pigs it is used for non-infectious locomotor disorders to reduce the symptoms of lameness and inflammation, and also for supportive therapy in the treatment of septicaemia and toxaemia around farrowing (mastitis-metritis-agalactia syndrome) with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
How does Novem work?
Novem contains meloxicam, which belongs to a class of medicines called non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Meloxicam acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.
As the prostaglandins are substances that trigger inflammation, pain, exudation and fever, meloxicam reduces those responses.
How has Novem been studied?
Appropriate studies have been made to show the safety and effectiveness in the target animals.

What benefit has Novem showed during the studies?
Studies in cattle showed that the addition of Novem to antibiotics therapy significantly improved clinical parameters and reduced fever compared to antibiotics alone.
Similarly, treatment combining rehydration solution and Novem was shown to be superior to rehydration solution alone.
Studies in pigs showed that Novem reduces the symptoms of lameness and inflammation in non- infectious locomotor disorders.
Similarly, treatment of mastitis-metritis-agalactia syndrome with adjunctive treatment of Novem and an appropriate antibiotic was shown to be superior to an antibiotic therapy alone.
What is the risk associated with Novem?
In cattle and pigs both subcutaneous and intramuscular administration are well tolerated; only a slight temporary swelling at the injection site following subcutaneous administration was observed in less than 10% of the cattle treated in clinical studies.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
People who are hypersensitive (allergic) to NSAIDs should avoid contact with Novem.
In case of accidental self-injection, the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately.
What is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption (withdrawal period)?
After the last administration of Novem cattle should not be slaughtered for 15 days, and pigs should not be slaughtered for 5 days.
What is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption?
After the last administration of Novem to cattle, the milk should not be used for 5 days.
Why has Novem been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) decided that the benefits of Novem are greater than any risks of treatment and they recommended that Novem should be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about Novem:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Novem to Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Germany on 2 March 2004.
Information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label of the carton.
