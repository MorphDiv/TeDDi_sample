Working with the & kate; editor
Overview
The & kate; editor is the editing area of the & kate; window. This editor is also used by & kwrite;, and it can be used in & konqueror; for displaying text files from your local computer, or from the network.
The editor is composed of the following components:
The editing area
This is where the text of your document is located.
The Scroll bars
The scroll bars indicate the position of the visible part of the document text, and can be used to move around the document. Dragging the scrollbars will not cause the insertion cursor to be moved.
The scroll bars are displayed and hidden as required.
The Icon Border
The icon border is a small pane on the left side of the editor, displaying a small icon next to marked lines.
You can set or remove a bookmark in a visible line by clicking the & LMB; in the icon border next to that line.
The display of the icon border can be toggled using the View Show Icon Border menu item.
The Line Numbers Pane
The Line numbers pane shows the line numbers of all visible lines in the document.
The display of the Line Numbers Pane can be toggled using the View Show Line Numbers menu item.
The Folding Pane
The folding pane allows you to collapse or expand foldable blocks of lines. The calculation of the foldable regions are done according to rules in the syntax highlight definition for the document.

Navigating in the Text
Moving around in the text in & kate; is like in most graphical text editors. You move the cursor using the arrow keys and the Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys in combination with the & Ctrl; and & Shift; modifiers. The & Shift; key is always used to generate a selection, while the & Ctrl; key have different effects on different keys:
For the Up and Down keys it means scroll rather than move the cursor.
For the Left and Right keys it means skip words rather than characters.
for the Page Up and Page Down keys it means move to the visible edge of the view rather than browse.
For the Home and End keys it means move to the beginning or end of the document rather than the beginning or end of the line.
& kate; also provides you with a way to quickly jump to a matching brace or paranthese: Place the cursor on the inside of a parenthese or brace character, and press Ctrl; 6 to jump to the matching parenthese or brace.
In addition you can use bookmarks to quickly jump to positions that you define on your own.
Working with the Selection
There are two basic ways of selecting text in & kate;: using the mouse, and using the keyboard.
To select using the mouse, hold down the & LMB; while dragging the mouse cursor from where the selection should start, to the desired end point. The text gets selected as you drag.
Double-clicking a word will select that word.
Triple-clicking in a line will select the entire line.
If & Shift; is held down while clicking, text will be selected:
If nothing is already selected, from the text cursor position to the mouse cursor position.
If there is a selection, from and including that selection to the mouse cursor position
When selecting text by dragging the mouse, the selected text is copied to the clipboard, and can be pasted by clicking the middle mouse button in the editor, or in any other application to which you want to paste the text.
To select using the keyboard, hold down the & Shift; key while using the navigation keys (Arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End, possibly in combination with & Ctrl; to extend the move of the text cursor).
See also the section Navigating in the Text in this Chapter.
To Copy the current selection, use the Edit Copy menu item or the keyboard shortcut (defaults to Ctrl; C).
To Deselect the current selection, use the Edit Deselect menu item, or the keyboard shortcut (default is Ctrl; Shift; A), or click with the & LMB; in the editor.
Using Block Selection
When Block Selection is enabled, you can make vertical selections in the text, meaning selecting limited columns from multiple lines. This is handy for working with tab separated lines for example.
Block Selection can be toggled using the Edit Block Selection Mode menu item. The default keyboard shortcut is Ctrl; Shift; B.
Using Overwrite Selection
If Overwrite Selection is enabled, typing or pasting text into the selection will cause the selected text to be replaced. If not enabled, new text will be added at the position of the text cursor.
Overwrite Selection is enabled by default.
To change the setting for this option, use the Cursor & Selection page of the Configuration Dialog.
Using Persistent Selection
When Persistent selection is enabled, typing characters or moving the cursor will not cause the Selection to become deselected. This means that you can move the cursor away from the selection and type text.
Persistent Selection is disabled by default.
Persistent Selection can be enabled in the Cursor & Selection page of the Configuration Dialog.
If Persistent Selection and Overwrite Selection are both enabled, typing or pasting text when the text cursor is inside the selection will cause it to be replaced and deselected.
Copying and Pasting Text
To copy text, select it and use the Edit Copy menu item. Additionally, selecting text with the mouse will cause selected text to be copied to the X selection.
To paste the text currently in the clipboard, use the Edit Paste menu item.
Additionally, text selected with the mouse may be pasted by clicking the middle mouse button at the desired position.
If you are using the & kde; desktop, you can retrieve earlier copied text from any application using the & klipper; icon in the system tray.
Finding and Replacing Text
The Search and Replace Bars
& kate; has an incremental search bar and a power search and replace bar, which offers the means of entering a replacement string along with a few extra options.
The bars offer the following common options:
Find
This is where to enter the search string. The interpretation of the string depends on some of the options described below.
Highlight all
If enabled, all matches in the whole document are highlighted.
Match case
If enabled, the search will be limited to entries that match the case (upper or lower) of each of the characters in the search pattern.
From cursor
If checked, the search will start at cursor position, otherwise it will start at the beginning of the first line in the document.
The power search and replace bar offers some additional options:
Plain Text
Literally match any occurrence of the search string.
Whole Words
If selected, the search will only match if there is a word boundary at both ends of the string matching, meaning not an alphanumeric character - either some other visible character or a line end.
Escape Sequences
If selected, the Add button will be enabled and allows you to add escape sequences to the search pattern from a predefined list.
Regular Expression
If selected, the search string is interpreted as a regular expression. The Add button will be enabled and allows you to add regular expression items to the search pattern from a predefined list.
See Regular Expressions for more on these.
Selection only
If checked, the search and replace will be performed within the selected text only.
Finding Text
To find text, launch the incremental search bar with Ctrl; F or from the Edit Find... menu item.
This opens the incremental search bar at the bottom of the editor window. On the left side of the bar is an icon to close the bar, followed by a small text box for entering the search pattern.
When you start entering characters of your search pattern, the search starts immediately. If there is a match in the text this is highlighted and the background color of the entry field changes to light green. If the search pattern does not match any string in the text, this is indicated by a light red background color of the entry field and Not found is displayed at the right side of the bar.
Use the Next or Previous button to jump to the next or previous match in the document.
You can modify the search behaviour by selecting the different Options described above.
Click on the green arrow icon at the right side of the incremental search bar to switch to the power search and replace bar.
To repeat the last find operation, if any, without calling the incremental search bar, use F3 Edit Find Next or Shift; F3 Edit Find Previous.
Replacing Text
To replace text, launch the power search and replace bar using the Edit Replace command, or the Ctrl; R shortcut.
On the upper left side of the bar is an icon to close the bar, followed by a small text box for entering the search pattern.
You can control the search mode by selecting the options Plain Text, Whole Words, Escape Sequences or Regular Expression described above.
Enter the text to replace with in the text box labelled Replace and click the Replace button to replace only the highlighted text or the Replace All button to replace the search text in the whole document. If the option Use placeholders is checked you can add special items to the replacement text by clicking the Add button.
You can modify the search and replace behaviour by selecting the different options on the right side of the bar.
Click on the green arrow icon at the right side of the power search and replace bar to switch to the incremental search bar.
If you are using a regular expression to find the text to replace, you can employ backreferences to reuse text captured in parenthesized subpatterns of the expression.
See for more on those.
You can do find, replace and ifind (incremental search) from the command line.
Using Bookmarks
The bookmarks feature allows you to mark certain lines, to be able to easily find them again.
You can set or remove a bookmark in a line in two ways:
Move the insertion cursor to the line and activate the Bookmarks Set Bookmark (Ctrl; B) command.
Click in the Icon Border next to the line.
Bookmarks are available in the Bookmarks menu. The individual bookmarks are available as menu items, labeled with the line number of the line with the bookmark, and the first few characters of the text in the line. To move the insertion cursor to the beginning of a bookmarked line, open the menu and select the bookmark.
To quickly move between bookmarks or to the next/ previous bookmark, use the Bookmarks Next (Ctrl; PgDown) or Bookmarks Previous (Ctrl; PgUp) commands.
Automatically Wrapping text
This feature allows you to have the text formatted in a very simple way: the text will be wrapped, so that no lines exceed a maximum number of characters per line, unless there is a longer string of non-whitespace characters.
To enable/ disable it, check/ uncheck the Static Word Wrap checkbox in the edit page of the configuration dialog.
To set the maximum line width (maximum characters per line), use the Wrap Words At option in the Editing page of the configuration dialog.
If enabled, it has the following effects:
While typing, the editor will automatically insert a hard line break after the last whitespace character at a position before the maximum line width is reached.
While loading a document, the editor will wrap the text in a similar way, so that no lines are longer than the maximum line width, if they contain any whitespace allowing that.
There is currently no way to set word wrap for document types, or even to enable or disable the feature on document level. This will be fixed in a future version of & kate;
Using automatic indenting
& kate; s editor component supports a variation of autoindenting modes, designed for different text formats. You can pick from the available modes using the Tools Indentation menu. The autoindent modules also provides a function Tools Align which will recalculate the indentation of the selected or current line. Thus, you may reindent your entire document by selecting all the text and activating that action.
All the indent modes use the indentation related settings in the active document.
You can set all sorts of configuration variables, including those related to indentation using Document Variables and File types.
Available Autoindent Modes
None
Selecting this mode turns automatic indenting off entirely.
Normal
This indenter simply keeps the indentation similar to the previous line with any content other than whitespace. You can combine this with using the indent and unindent actions for indenting to your own taste.
C Style
An indenter for C and similar languages, such as C++, C#, java, javascript and so on. This indenter will not work with scripting languages such as Perl or PHP.
Haskell
An indenter for the functional programming language Haskell.
Lilypond
An indenter for the Lilypond notation language for music.
Lisp
An indenter specifically for the Lisp scripting language and Lisp dialects.
Python
An indenter specifically for the python scripting language.
SS C Style
An alternative indenter for C and similar languages, with the same constraints.
XML
A very nice XML auto-indenter. However tempting, do not try to use this with HTML other than XHTML, because it fails with the old style HTML tags (open tags like for example & lt; brgt;)
Variable Indenter
The variable indenter is experimental, and may change behavior or disappear in future versions.
The variable indenter is special in that it can be configured using variables in the document (or in a filetype configuration). The following variables are read:
var-indent-indent-after
A regular expression which will cause a line to be indented by one unit, if the first non-whitespace-only line above matches.
var-indent-indent
A regular expression, which will cause a matching line to be indented by one unit.
var-indent-unindent
A regular expression which will cause the line to be unindented by one unit if matching.
var-indent-triggerchars
A list of characters that should cause the indention to be recalculated immediately when typed.
var-indent-handle-couples
A list of parenthese sets to handle. Any combination of'parens', 'braces' and'brackets'. Each set type is handled the following way: If there are unmatched opening instances on the above line, one indent unit is added, if there are unmatched closing instances on the current line, one indent unit is removed.
var-indent-couple-attribute
When looking for unmatched couple openings/ closings, only characters with this attribute are considered. The value must be the attribute name from the syntax xml file, for example "Symbol". If it's not specified, attribute 0 is used (usually'Normal Text ').
A regular expression which will cause a line to be indented by one unit, if the first non-whitespace-only line above matches. var-indent-indent: A regular expression, which will cause a matching line to be indented by one unit.
The Find Text and Replace Text Dialogs
Text to Find
Case Insensitive
If enabled, the search will be case insensitive.
Find Backwards
If checked, the search will look for the first match above the starting point, either cursor position or the beginning of the document, if the From Beginning option is enabled.
Replace With
This is where to enter the replacement string.
Selected Text
This option is disabled if no text is selected, or if the Prompt on Replace option is enabled. If checked, all matches of the search string within the selected text will be replaced with the replace string.
Prompt on Replace
If checked, a small dialog will prompt you for what to do for each time a match is found. It offers the following options:
Yes
Activate this to replace the current match (which is selected in the editor).
No
Activate to skip the current match, and try to find another one.
All
Activate to cancel prompting, and just replace all matches.
Close
Activate this to skip the current match and end the searching.
There is currently no way to use minimal matching when searching for a regular expression. This will be added in a future version of & kate;
To find text, launch the Find Text Dialog with Ctrl; F or from the Edit Find... menu item, enter a search string, set the options as desired and hit Ok. If the search was started at cursor position and no match was found before reaching the end (or beginning if you are searching backward) of the document, you will be asked if you want to wrap the search.
If a match is found it is selected and the Find Text Dialog is hidden, but stay tuned, finding further matches is very easy:
To find the next match in the search direction, use the Edit Find Next command or press F3.
If no match is found before reaching the document end (or beginning if you are searching backward), you will be asked if you want to wrap the search.
To replace text, launch the Replace text Dialog using the Edit Replace command, or the Ctrl; R shortcut, enter a search string and optionally a replace string (if the replace string is empty, each match will be removed), set the options as desired and hit the Ok button.
