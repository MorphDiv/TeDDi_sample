List of profiles
List of profiles known to gnome-terminal. The list contains strings naming subdirectories relative to /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles.
Profile to use for new terminals
Profile to be used when opening a new window or tab. Must be in profile_list.
Whether the menubar has access keys
Whether to have Alt+letter access keys for the menubar. They may interfere with some applications run inside the terminal so it's possible to turn them off.
Whether the standard GTK shortcut for menubar access is enabled
Normally you can access the menubar with F10. This can also be customized via gtkrc (gtk-menu-bar-accel = "whatever"). This option allows the standard menubar accelerator to be disabled.
[UTF-8,current]
List of available encodings
A subset of possible encodings are presented in the Encoding submenu. This is a list of encodings to appear there. The special encoding name "current" means to display the encoding of the current locale.
Whether to ask for confirmation when closing terminal windows
Whether to ask for confirmation when closing a terminal window which has more than one open tab.
Default
Human-readable name of the profile
Human-readable name of the profile.
Whether to show menubar in new windows/tabs
True if the menubar should be shown in new windows, for windows/tabs with this profile.
Default color of text in the terminal
Default color of text in the terminal, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red").
Default color of terminal background
Default color of terminal background, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red").
Default color of bold text in the terminal
Default color of bold text in the terminal, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red"). This is ignored if bold_color_same_as_fg is true.
Whether bold text should use the same color as normal text
If true, boldface text will be rendered using the same color as normal text.
What to do with dynamic title
If the application in the terminal sets the title (most typically people have their shell set up to do this), the dynamically-set title can erase the configured title, go before it, go after it, or replace it. The possible values are "replace", "before", "after", and "ignore".
Title for terminal
Title to display for the terminal window or tab. This title may be replaced by or combined with the title set by the application inside the terminal, depending on the title_mode setting.
Whether to allow bold text
If true, allow applications in the terminal to make text boldface.
Whether to silence terminal bell
If true, don't make a noise when applications send the escape sequence for the terminal bell.
Characters that are considered "part of a word"
When selecting text by word, sequences of these characters are considered single words. Ranges can be given as "A-Z". Literal hyphen (not expressing a range) should be the first character given.
Whether to use custom terminal size for new windows
If true, newly created terminal windows will have custom size specified by default_size_columns and default_size_rows.
Default number of columns
Number of columns in newly created terminal windows. Has no effect if use_custom_default_size is not enabled.
Default number of rows
Number of rows in newly created terminal windows. Has no effect if use_custom_default_size is not enabled.
Position of the scrollbar
Where to put the terminal scrollbar. Possibilities are "left", "right", and "hidden".
Number of lines to keep in scrollback
Number of scrollback lines to keep around. You can scroll back in the terminal by this number of lines; lines that don't fit in the scrollback are discarded. If scrollback_unlimited is true, this value is ignored.
Whether an unlimited number of lines should be kept in scrollback
If true, scrollback lines will never be discarded. The scrollback history is stored on disk temporarily, so this may cause the system to run out of disk space if there is a lot of output to the terminal.
Whether to scroll to the bottom when a key is pressed
If true, pressing a key jumps the scrollbar to the bottom.
Whether to scroll to the bottom when there's new output
If true, whenever there's new output the terminal will scroll to the bottom.
What to do with the terminal when the child command exits
Possible values are "close" to close the terminal, and "restart" to restart the command.
Whether to launch the command in the terminal as a login shell
If true, the command inside the terminal will be launched as a login shell. (argv[0] will have a hyphen in front of it.)
Whether to update login records when launching terminal command
If true, the system login records utmp and wtmp will be updated when the command inside the terminal is launched.
Whether to run a custom command instead of the shell
If true, the value of the custom_command setting will be used in place of running a shell.
Whether to blink the cursor
The possible values are "system" to use the global cursor blinking settings, or "on" or "off" to set the mode explicitly.
The cursor appearance
The possible values are "block" to use a block cursor, "ibeam" to use a vertical line cursor, or "underline" to use an underline cursor.
Custom command to use instead of the shell
Run this command in place of the shell, if use_custom_command is true.
Icon for terminal window
Icon to use for tabs/windows containing this profile.
Palette for terminal applications
Terminals have a 16-color palette that applications inside the terminal can use. This is that palette, in the form of a colon-separated list of color names. Color names should be in hex format e.g. "#FF00FF"
Font
An Pango font name. Examples are "Sans 12" or "Monospace Bold 14".
Background type
Type of terminal background. May be "solid" for a solid color, "image" for an image, or "transparent" for either real transparency if a compositing window manager is running, or pseudo-transparency otherwise.
Background image
Filename of a background image.
Whether to scroll background image
If true, scroll the background image with the foreground text; if false, keep the image in a fixed position and scroll the text above it.
How much to darken the background image
A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how much to darken the background image. 0.0 means no darkness, 1.0 means fully dark. In the current implementation, there are only two levels of darkness possible, so the setting behaves as a boolean, where 0.0 disables the darkening effect.
Effect of the Backspace key
Sets what code the backspace key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "ascii-del" is normally considered the correct setting for the Backspace key.
Effect of the Delete key
Sets what code the delete key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "escape-sequence" is normally considered the correct setting for the Delete key.
Whether to use the colors from the theme for the terminal widget
If true, the theme color scheme used for text entry boxes will be used for the terminal, instead of colors provided by the user.
Whether to use the system font
If true, the terminal will use the desktop-global standard font if it's monospace (and the most similar font it can come up with otherwise).
