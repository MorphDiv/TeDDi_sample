The web site %s supports authentication for the page you are viewing. The identity of this web site has been verified by %s, a certificate authority you trust for this purpose.
Connection Encrypted: High-grade Encryption (%s %d bit)
The page you are viewing was encrypted before being transmitted over the Internet.
