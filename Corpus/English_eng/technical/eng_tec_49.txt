Chart Wizard
you can choose a chart type.
Pie
A pie chart shows values as circular sectors of the total circle.
The length of the arc, or the area of each sector, is proportional to its value.
Pie - this sub-type shows sectors as coloured areas of the total pie, for one data column only.
In the created chart, you can click and drag any sector to separate that sector from the remaining pie or to join it back.
Exploded pie - this sub-type shows the sectors already separated from each other.
In the created chart, you can click and drag any sector to move it along a radial from the pie's centre.
Doughnut - this sub-type can show multiple data columns.
Each data column is shown as one doughnut shape with a hole inside, where the next data column can be shown.
In the created chart, you can click and drag an outer sector to move it along a radial from the doughnut's centre.
Exploded doughnut - this sub-type shows the outer sectors already separated from the remaining doughnut.
In the created chart, you can click and drag an outer sector to move it along a radial from the doughnut's centre.
