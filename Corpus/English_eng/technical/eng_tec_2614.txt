(PHP 3, PHP 4)
The fields parameter is an array of arrays, each array describing the format of one field in the database.
Each field consists of a name, a character indicating the field type, a length, and a precision.
The types of fields available are:
Boolean.
These do not have a length or precision.
Memo. (Note that these aren't supported by PHP.) These do not have a length or precision.
Date (stored as YYYYMMDD).
These do not have a length or precision.
Number.
These have both a length and a precision (the number of digits after the decimal point).
String.
If the database is successfully created, a dbase_identifier is returned, otherwise FALSE is returned.
Example 1.
Creating a dBase database file
/ / "database" name $dbname = "/ tmp / test.dbf"; / / database "definition" $def = array (array("date", "D"), array("name", "C", 50), array("age", "N", 3, 0), array("email", "C", 128), array("ismember", "L")); / / creation if (!dbase_create($dbname, $def)) print "strong Error! / strong";
