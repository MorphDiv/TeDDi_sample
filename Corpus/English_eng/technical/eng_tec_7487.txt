ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1/ 17 1.
NAME OF THE VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Nobilis IB 4-91, lyophilisate for suspension
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains per dose:
Active substance
Live attenuated avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) variant strain 4-91: ≥ 3.6 log10 EID50 *
* EID50 = 50% Embryo infective dose: the virus titre required to produce infection in 50% of the embryos inoculated.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Lyophilisate for suspension.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Chickens
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
Active immunisation of chickens to reduce the respiratory signs of Infectious Bronchitis caused by the variant strain IB 4-91.
4.3 Contraindications
Future layers and breeders should not be vaccinated before 3 weeks of age.
Nobilis IB 4-91 given at day-old can adversely affect the efficacy of Turkey Rhinotracheitis (TRT) vaccine given within 7 days; therefore this vaccination scheme is contraindicated.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
The vaccine virus may spread from vaccinated to non-vaccinated chickens and appropriate care should be taken to separate vaccinated from non-vaccinated.
Wash and disinfect hands and equipment after vaccinating to avoid spread of the virus.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Only healthy animals should be vaccinated.
Nobilis IB 4-91 is intended to protect chickens against respiratory signs of disease caused by IBV variant strain 4-91 only and should not be used as a replacement for other IBV vaccines.
The product should only be used after it has been established that IBV variant strain 4-91 is epidemiologically
2/ 17 relevant in the area.
Care should be taken to avoid the introduction of the variant strain into an area where it is not present.
Care should be taken to avoid spread of the vaccine virus from vaccinated chickens to pheasants.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
None.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Vaccination with Nobilis IB 4-91 may induce mild respiratory signs of disease which may persist for a few days depending on the health and condition of the chickens.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Nobilis IB4-91 has been shown to be safe in layers and breeders during lay.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Nobilis IB 4-91 given at day-old can adversely affect the efficacy of Turkey Rhinotracheitis (TRT) vaccine given within 7 days.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
At least 3.6 log10 EID50 (1 dose) per animal by either spray vaccination, drinking water or intranasal/ ocular administration.
Where the number of chickens is between the standard dosages, the next higher dosage should be used.
Guideline:
Broiler:
The vaccine can be administered to 1-day-old chicks and older chickens by coarse spray or by intranasal/ ocular administration.
The vaccine can be administered to 7-day and older chickens by drinking water.
For prolonged immunity, chickens should be revaccinated every 6 weeks after the initial administration.
Future layers and breeders:
The vaccine can be administered to future layers and breeders from three weeks of age onwards via intranasal/ ocular route, coarse spray or drinking water.
Spray method:
The vaccine should preferably be dissolved in distilled water or alternatively in cool, clean water.
The appropriate number of vials should be opened under water.
The volume of water for reconstitution should be sufficient to ensure an even distribution when sprayed onto the chickens.
This will vary according to the age of the chickens being vaccinated and the management system, but 250 to 400 ml of water per 1 000 doses is suggested.
The vaccine suspension should be spread evenly over the correct number of chickens, at a distance of 30-40 cm using a coarse spray, preferably when the chickens are sitting together in dim light.
The spray apparatus should be free from sediments, corrosion and traces of disinfectants and ideally should be used for vaccination purposes only.
Drinking water:
The vials should be opened under water.
Use cool, clean water to dissolve the vaccine.
For administration of the vaccine, as a general rule, dissolve 1 000 doses in one litre per age in days up to a maximum volume of 20 litres per 1 000 doses.
For heavy breeds, or in hot weather, the quantity of water may be increased up to 40 litres per 1 000 doses.
By adding approximately 2 grams of skimmed milk powder or 20 ml of liquid skimmed milk per litre of water the virus retains its activity longer.
Ensure that all the vaccine suspension is consumed within 1-2 hours.
The vaccine should be given in the early morning as this is the main period of water intake or during the cool period on a hot day.
Feed should be available when vaccinating.
Water should be withheld before vaccination to make the chickens thirsty.
The length of time of water deprivation is strongly dependent on the climatological
3/ 17 circumstances.
Water withholding should be kept as short as possible with a minimum of half an hour.
A sufficient number of water containers to provide adequate drinking space is essential.
These should be clean and free from traces of detergents and disinfectants.
Turn on mains water when all the vaccine water has been consumed.
Intranasal/ ocular administration:
Dissolve the vaccine in physiological saline solution or sterile distilled water (usually 30 ml per 1 000 doses, 75 ml per 2 500 doses) and administer by means of a standardized dropper.
One drop should be applied onto one nostril or one eye.
Ensure that the nasal drop is inhaled before freeing the bird.
Ocular/ intranasal administration or coarse spray, give the best responses and these should be the methods of choice, especially when vaccinating young chickens.
Vaccination programme:
The veterinarian should determine the optimum vaccination schedule according to the local situation.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Ten times the maximum dose was shown to be safe for the target species by all the recommended routes and methods of administration.
4.11 Withdrawal period
Zero days.

9.
ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
Since the stability of IBV in suspension may be low due to sensitivity to high temperatures and impurities, water used for dissolving the freeze-dried vaccine should be cool and of good quality.
By adding skimmed milk to the drinking water the vaccine virus retains its activity longer.
Only skimmed milk should be used, since fat in whole milk may block the automatic drinking systems as well as reduce vaccine virus efficacy.
15/ 17 Only healthy chickens should be vaccinated.
Nobilis IB 4-91 is intended to protect chickens against respiratory signs of disease caused by IBV variant strain 4-91 only and should not be used as a replacement for other IBV vaccines.
Chickens should be vaccinated against other prevalent IBV serotypes (e. g.
Massachusetts) according to the local IB vaccination programme.
The product should only be used after it has been established that IBV variant strain 4-91 is epidemiologically relevant in the area.
Care should be taken to avoid the introduction of the variant strain into an area where it is not present.
Do not mix or administer with other products.
Wash and disinfect hands and equipment after vaccinating.
