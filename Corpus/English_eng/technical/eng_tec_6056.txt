Removes all content from the widget.
Returns number of items in a widget such as combobox or listbox.
Returns index of current column.
Returns index of current item.

Inserts item at index position.
Inserts multiple items (EOL-separated) at index position.

Returns current widget's content. This was required inside widget A to return widget A content when requested by widget B. The new method is to use @A. text inside B instead of just @A if you just want the unaltered text.
Returns selected text or text of current item. This is deprecated for @mywidget. selected.
Does nothing. This is useful if you request a CheckBox or RadioButton to return a value where a state, typically the unchecked state, has no value. The @null prevents an error indicating it is empty.

Returns value of an environment (shell) variable. Do not use $in the name. For example, @env(PATH).
Executes an external shell command.
Parses an expression and returns computed value.
Executes loop: values from items list (passed as EOL-separated string) are assigned to the variable. Old @forEach(i, A\ B\ C\) @# @i=A@endNewforeach i in MyArray do / /i = key, MyArray[i] = valend
Executes loop: variable is set to start and is increased by step each time loop is executed. Execution stops when variable becomes larger than end. Old @for(i,1,10,1) @# @i=1 @endif New for i=0 to 20 step 5 do debug(i) end.
Returns the value of a global variable.
Translates the string into the current language. Texts in GUI would be automatically extracted for translation.
Executes block if expression is true (non-zero number or non-empty string.) Old Close with @endif New if val == true then / / do op elseif cond / / second chance else / / cond failed endif
Executes another Kommander dialog. Current dialog directory is used if no path is given. Arguments may be given as named arguments which will become global variables in the new dialog. For instance: var=val
Reads setting from configuration file for this dialog.
Sets the value of a global variable. Global variables exist for the life of the Kommander window.
Stores setting in configuration file for this dialog.
Begin of switch block. Following case values are compared to expression. @switch()@case()@end
Executes an external D-Bus call.

Properties
The Property EditorYou can change the appearance and behavior of the selected widget in the property editor. You can set properties for components and forms at design time and see the immediately see the effects of the changes. Each property has its own editor which (depending on the property) can be used to enter new values, open a special dialog, or to select values from a predefined list. Click F1 to get detailed help for the selected property. You can resize the columns of the editor by dragging the separators in the list's header. Signal HandlersIn the Signal Handlers tab you can define connections between the signals emitted by widgets and the slots in the form. (These connections can also be made using the connection tool.)
Object Explorer
The Object Explorer The Object Explorer provides an overview of the relationships between the widgets in a form. You can use the clipboard functions using a context menu for each item in the view. It is also useful for selecting widgets in forms that have complex layouts. The columns can be resized by dragging the separator in the list's header. The second tab shows all the form's slots, class variables, includes, etc.
Dialogs
Start typing the buffer you want to switch to here (ALT+B)
The File Overview Window The File Overview Window displays all open dialogs.
Action Editor
The Action Editor The Action Editor is used to add actions and action groups to a form, and to connect actions to slots. Actions and action groups can be dragged into menus and into toolbars, and may feature keyboard shortcuts and tooltips. If actions have pixmaps these are displayed on toolbar buttons and beside their names in menus.
Message Log
There is a dialog already running.
Run
The Form WindowUse the various tools to add widgets or to change the layout and behavior of the components in the form. Select one or multiple widgets to move them or lay them out. If a single widget is chosen it can be resized using the resize handles. Changes in the Property Editor are visible at design time, and you can preview the form in different styles. You can change the grid resolution, or turn the grid off in the Preferences dialog from the Edit menu. You can have several forms open, and all open forms are listed in the Form List.

Central Color & Roles
Choose the central color role
Select a color role. Available central color roles are: Background - general background color. Foreground - general foreground color. Base - used as the background color for example, for text entry widgets; it is usually white or another light color. Text - the foreground color used with Base. Usually this is the same as the Foreground, in which case it must provide good contrast both with the Background and with the Base. Button - general button background color; useful where buttons need a background different from Background, as in the Macintosh style. ButtonText - a foreground color used with the Button color. Highlight - a color used to indicate a selected or highlighted item. HighlightedText - a text color that contrasts to Highlight. BrightText - a text color that is very different from Foreground and contrasts well with, for example, black.
