Translation of Controls in the Dialogue Box Editor
The Language toolbar in the Basic IDE dialogue box editor shows controls to enable and manage localisable dialogue boxes.

You may want to create dialogue boxes that automatically show localised strings according to the user's language settings.

Insert any number of controls to your dialogue box and enter all strings you want.
Select another language in the Current Language list box.
Using the control's property dialogue boxes, edit all strings to the other language.
Repeat for all languages that you added.
The user of your dialogue box will see the strings of the user interface language of the user's version of %PRODUCTNAME, if you did provide strings in that language.
If no language matches the user's version, the user will see the default language strings.
If the user has an older version of %PRODUCTNAME that does not know localisable string resources for BASIC dialogue boxes, the user will see the default language strings.
