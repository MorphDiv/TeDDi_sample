& konqueror; the Web Browser
Browsing www. konqueror. org
Connecting to the Internet
Once you are connected to the Internet you can use & konqueror; to browse the Web just as easily as you can use it to handle your local files. Just type a & URL; into the Location Toolbar window, press & Enter;, and you are away!
If you use a dial-up modem connection, then you will be using & kppp; or a similar dialer program to make the connection.
If your machine is connected to a local area network (LAN) that gives you a proxy connection to the Internet then you will have to set & konqueror; up for the proxy connection. This can be done with the Proxy page of the Settings Configure Konqueror... dialog.
If you are lucky enough to have a high speed cable connection, then the service provider will probably give you an external cable modem which needs an ethernet connection to your machine. Unfortunately the details of how to establish the connection depend on the service provider and to some extent on which Linux/ UNIX; distribution you are using. Some ISP s connect their customers to the Internet through a proxy server, in which case you will have to set up & konqueror; to use it. You may find it useful to search the archives of your distribution's user group mailing list for help.
An error message such as Unknown Host usually means that & konqueror; cannot find a connection to the Internet or that you have entered an incorrect & URL;.
Surfing and Searching
Once you have a connection to the Internet, you can surf with & konqueror; just as you can with any other browser.
Type a & URL; into the Location Toolbar window, press & Enter; or left click on the Go button at the right hand end of the Location Toolbar, and & konqueror; will download and display that page. If you have visited the page before, & konqueror; 's Automatic Text Completion feature can help you type the & URL; a second time, or you could look through the History page in the Navigation Panel. If you want to use one of the web's search engines, & konqueror; 's Web Shortcuts feature can make this easier.
Left click on a link in the page to go there.
To open a link in a new instance of & konqueror;, leaving the old page still visible, & MMB; click on the link or right click on it and select the Open in New Window option. Alternatively, you might want to Open in New Tab. Tabbed Browsing will let you hold a number of pages in one & konqueror; window and quickly switch between them with a single mouse click.
You could also select the multiple view mode with Ctrl; Shift; L or the Menubar Window Split View Left/ Right option which will let you see different pages at the same time. This can be useful if you are looking through a complicated set of HTML pages, but make sure the little link box at the bottom right hand corner is empty when you are doing this.
To go back to the previous page use the Alt; Left Arrow shortcut, the Back button on the Toolbar, or the Menubar Go Back option.
Similarly, once you have gone back you can go forward by using Alt; Right Arrow, the Forward button, or the Menubar Go Forward option.
If you want to stop the download for any reason then use the Esc key, the Toolbar Stop button or the Menubar View Stop item.
When you are viewing a web page you should see two new icons in the Toolbar, looking like magnifying glasses with small + and - symbols. Use these to adjust the size of the text in the page if you find it difficult to read. How well this works will depend on how the web page has been constructed.
Tabbed Browsing
By using this feature you can make & konqueror; load multiple web pages in the same window, and switch between them using tabbed pages. This way, you can preload a page in the background while you carry on reading another.
To use tabbed browsing, right click on a link and choose Open in New Tab from the drop down menu. The page will be downloaded and displayed as normal, but with tabs across the top of the view, one tab for each page. Left click on a tab to view that page, or you can use the shortcuts Ctrl; [and Ctrl;] to cycle through the tab pages. Alternatively, you can scroll through the tabs using the mouse wheel while the mouse pointer is over the tab bar (presuming that your mouse has one). Also, double-clicking over the empty tab bar space will open a new tab.
The Open in Background Tab option in the & RMB; menu also downloads the page and shows a new tab for it, but the new page will not be displayed until you left click on the tab.
If you check the Open links in new tab instead of in new window box in the Web Behavior page of the Settings Configure Konqueror... dialog, & MMB; clicking on a link will open it in a new tab page and if you hold the & Shift; key down while clicking the & MMB; the link will be opened in a background tab page.
Right clicking on a tab will bring up a menu with the following options:
New Tab
This opens a new, blank, tabbed page view. You can then download a web page into it by typing the & URL; into the Location Bar or by making a selection from the Bookmark Toolbar or the Navigation Panel history page.
Duplicate Tab
To create a duplicate tabbed page.
Detach Tab
This option removes the selected tabbed page from the current & konqueror; window and opens it in a new instance of & konqueror;.
Close Tab
To close the selected tab page.
Reload
Reloads the content of the current tab.
Other Tabs
Displays a submenu showing all other tabs. Choosing a tab from this list makes it the active tab.
Other Tabs Reload all Tabs
Reloads the content of every tab.
Other Tabs Close Other Tabs
To close all but the selected tab page.
Web Shortcuts
If enabled, & konqueror; 's Web Shortcuts feature lets you submit a query directly to a search engine or similar web site without having to visit the site first.
For example, entering gg: konqueror into the Location Bar and pressing & Enter; will ask Google to search for items related to & konqueror;.
To see what Web Shortcuts are available, and perhaps add your own, use Settings Configure Konqueror... to open the Settings dialog box and click on the Web Shortcuts icon.
Once there, to make a new Web Shortcut select New... and you will now have a new dialog requesting the options and specifications of your new Web Shortcut. The first field is for the human readable name of the search provider; that is, simply the name of the Search provider. For example, Google.
In the next field you should enter the & URI; that is used to do a search on the search engine. The whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\{@} or \\{0}. The recommended version is \\{@} since it removes all query variables (name = value) from the resulting string whereas \\{0} will be substituted with the unmodified query string.
You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{ name} to specify a value given by name = value in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once, like (\\{ name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as substitution value for the resulting & URI;. A quoted string can be used as the default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.
To make a basic Web Shortcut here however, all that is required is the & URI; that is used to do a search on the search engine. Following our previous example with Google, we would enter http: / /www. google. com/ search? q=\\{@}amp; ie=UTF-8amp; oe=UTF-8. You can often easily find where to place the \\{@} by doing a search on the search engine in question, and then analysing the & URL; address. For example, doing a Google search for & konqueror; produces the & URL;: http: / /www. google. com/ search? q=konqueroramp; ie=UTF-8amp; oe=UTF-8. Now you need to merely replace & konqueror; with \\{@} in this example to find the appropriate & URI; to be entered.
In the third field you need to enter the & URI; shortcut. For example, the gg in gg: konqueror. In the next option & mdash; the drop-down menu & mdash; you have the option to select the character set that will be used to encode the search query. Once you have entered all the options correctly to your satisfaction, press & Enter; and your new Web Shortcut should now be available in & konqueror;.
Access Keys
& konqueror; has full support for the accesskey & HTML; attribute in forms and links. Access keys allow you to use the keyboard keys for functions which would perhaps normally be done with the mouse, such as following links. The benefit of this is, quite simply, that users can interact with a page with devices other than a pointing device.
To activate the access keys in & konqueror;, press and release & Ctrl;. Once this is pressed, if a particular link on the website has the accesskey attribute in the given link, then the character(s) should appear over the link, identifying what needs to be pressed. Then, you can enter the character(s) associated with the link as an alternative to following the link with the mouse. To disable the access keys once activated you can press & Ctrl; again.
The proper use of this feature requires that the web designer of the page has specifically assigned, using the accesskey attribute, an access key for the link. Many web designers might not include the accesskey in their links and forms, and consequently this feature will be unusable on the given webpage.
Browser Identification
When & konqueror; connects to a web site it sends some brief browser identification information, known as the User Agent string. Many web sites use this information to customize the pages that they send back, based on the strengths and weaknesses of different browsers.
Unfortunately, some badly designed sites refuse to work properly unless you are using a browser that the site recognizes as a valid one, even though if given a chance, & konqueror; will work satisfactorily with the vast majority of web pages.
To overcome this problem you can change the browser identification information that & konqueror; sends for specific sites or domains by selecting Settings Configure Konqueror... to bring up the Settings dialog box and clicking the Browser Identification icon.
Problems with getting a web page to work properly may also be due to its use of & Java; or JavaScript. If you suspect that this may be the case check that they have been enabled in the Java & JavaScript section of the Settings dialog box.
Saving and Printing Web Items
When you are viewing a web page you can save it (or at least the basic & HTML; or similar source text) to your local disk with Location Save As.... If the page you are viewing uses frames, then you will also be given the Location Save Frame As... option. Left click in the frame you want to save first.
If the page uses a background image, you can get and save that with the Location Save Background Image As... option.
But if what you really want is that glorious picture of the latest Ferrari, then right clicking on the image will give you a drop-down menu with a Save Image As... option. Be sure to respect the owner's copyright, and ask for permission before using any pictures saved this way for anything other than your own viewing pleasure.
If you right click on a link (which may be a picture) and select Save Link As... from the pop up menu the basic & HTML; or similar source text will be downloaded and saved on your local disk.
Right clicking on a link (which may be a picture) and choosing Copy Link Location will copy the & URL; of the link to the clipboard so you can then paste it into, say, an e-mail to a friend telling her about this wonderful new site.
Right clicking on a picture and choosing Copy Image Location copies the & URL; of the picture to the clipboard.
To save a complete web page, including images, select Archive Web Page... from the Tools menu. Note that this feature is provided by a plugin and may not have been installed on your system. The web page will be saved as a single file with a. war extension and can be opened by left clicking on the filename in & konqueror; running in File Manager mode.
Printing a copy of the page you are viewing is easily done with the Menubar Location Print... or Print Frame option or with the Toolbar Print button.
& FTP;
& FTP;, or File Transfer Protocol, is one of the earliest, and still perhaps the best, way of transferring files between computers over the Internet.
With & FTP; you can see files and folders on the distant computer just as if they were on your own system, download them onto your computer using & konqueror; 's normal Copy and Paste or Drag n 'Drop methods and, if allowed, upload files from your machine to the other computer's filesystem. To try it, type the & URL;
ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde
into the Location Toolbar and press & Enter;. As long as you are connected to the Internet, and as long as the & kde; 's & FTP; site is not too busy, you should end up seeing the / pub/ kde folder at & kde-ftp;
Although, strictly speaking, & FTP; & URL; s should be entered starting with ftp: / / and WWW & URL; s starting with http: / / & konqueror; is usually smart enough to figure out what is meant, and insert these characters for you if you leave them out.
When you access an & FTP; site it will usually need some form of username and password from you. To simplify things, most & FTP; sites that offer files for free downloading will accept the word anonymous as a username and your email address as a password, and to make your life even easier & konqueror; will automatically supply these without troubling you.
If you try to access an & FTP; site that does not need a proper username or password but which is too busy to accept any more connections, & konqueror; often interprets the busy message as a request for a name and password and will therefore pop up a dialog box asking you to supply them.
Sites that are more concerned with security will need a proper username and password, in which case & konqueror; will ask you for them or you can include the username in the & URL; you type into the Location Toolbar, as for example
ftp: / / username @ftp. cia. org
& konqueror; will then prompt you for the password.
& konqueror; can also support automatic logins as specified in a. netrc file. Details of how to enable this feature are given at http: / /www. konqueror. org/ faq. html#netrc
& URL; s with Port Numbers
If you specify a port number in your & URL;, as in for example http: / /intranet. corp. com:1080, you might get the error message Access to restricted port in POST denied. This is done for security reasons. If you nevertheless need to access a server on this port, just add a key line OverridenPorts=CommaSeparatedListOfAllowedPorts to $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kio_httprc or ~/. kde/ share/ config/ kio_httprc.
For example OverridenPorts=23,15 (it should not include any embedded spaces).
& konqueror; will reject the following ports (the list is hardcoded in kdelibs/ kio/ kio/ job. cpp):
1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 37, 42, 43, 53, 77, 79, 87, 95, 101, 102, 103, 104, 109, 110, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 123, 135, 139, 143, 179, 389, 512, 513, 514, 515, 526, 530, 531, 532, 540, 556, 587, 601, 989, 990, 992, 993, 995, 1080, 2049, 4045, 6000, 6667
