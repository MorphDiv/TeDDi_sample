EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
XOLAIR
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Xolair?
Xolair is a powder and solvent, which are made up into a solution for injection.
Each vial contains 75 or 150 mg of the active substance omalizumab.
What is Xolair used for?
Xolair is used to improve the control of severe persistent asthma that is caused by an allergy.
It is used as an add-on to existing asthma treatment in adults and adolescents over the age of 12 years, who must: • have had a positive skin test result for an allergy caused by an allergen (a stimulus that causes an allergy) in the air, such as house dust mites, pollen or mould, • have reduced lung function (less than 80% of normal), as well as frequent symptoms during the day or waking up during the night, and, • have had many severe ‘ exacerbations ’ of asthma (where asthma got worse, requiring rescue treatment with other medicines) despite treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist.
Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients whose asthma is caused by IgE (immunoglobulin E, an antibody).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Xolair used?
Xolair treatment should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of severe persistent asthma.
Before giving Xolair, the doctor must measure the level of IgE in the patient ’ s blood.
Patients whose IgE level is below 76 IU/ ml are less likely to benefit from the medicine.
Xolair is given by a healthcare worker (such as a doctor or nurse) as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) at the top of the arm or in the thigh, every two or four weeks.
The dose and dosing frequency of Xolair depend on the level of IgE in the blood and body weight.
The usual dose range is between 75 and 375 mg in one to three injections, and the maximum recommended dose is 375 mg every two weeks.
See the Summary of Product Characteristics (which is also part of the EPAR) for further information.
How does Xolair work?
The active substance in Xolair, omalizumab, is a monoclonal antibody.
A monoclonal antibody is an antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure (called an antigen) that is in the body.
Omalizumab has been designed to bind to human IgE, which is 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

By binding to IgE, omalizumab ‘ mops up’ the free IgE circulating in the blood.
This means that when the body encounters an allergen, there is less IgE available to trigger an allergic reaction.
This helps to reduce the symptoms of allergy, such as asthma attacks.
How has Xolair been studied?
The effects of Xolair were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
Xolair has been studied in patients with allergic asthma in five main studies involving 2,299 patients, including one study of 482 patients with severe allergic asthma that was not controlled by conventional treatments.
The effects of Xolair were compared with those of placebo (a dummy treatment), when added to the patients’ existing treatment.
The main measures of effectiveness were the number of exacerbations and number of patients with exacerbations of asthma, the patients’ quality of life (assessed using standard questionnaires), and the reduction in the amount of inhaled corticosteroid that the patients needed to take.
What benefit has Xolair shown during the studies?
The first three studies showed that patients receiving Xolair had around half as many exacerbations of asthma over the first 28 or 52 weeks of treatment, with around 0.5 exacerbations per year in the Xolair group and around one per year in the placebo group.
Fewer of the patients being given Xolair had exacerbations than those being given placebo.
Patients taking Xolair also reported a greater improvement in their quality of life than those taking placebo.
In the fourth study, there was a greater reduction in use of fluticasone (a corticosteroid) in the patients taking Xolair than in those taking placebo.
Across these studies, the effects of Xolair were greater in patients with severe asthma.
In the study of patients with severe allergic asthma, although there was no difference in the rate of asthma exacerbations between Xolair- and placebo-treated patients, Xolair led to a reduction in the number of exacerbations that was consistent with previous studies.
What is the risk associated with Xolair?
The most common side effects with Xolair (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, and injection site reactions, including pain, swelling, erythema (redness) and pruritus (itching).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Xolair, see the Package Leaflet.
Xolair should not be given to people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients.
Why has Xolair been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that, overall, there was a pattern of results in the studies of Xolair that show that it is effective in treating severe allergic asthma, despite the results of the final main study.
Therefore, the Committee decided that Xolair’ s benefits are greater than its risks as an additional treatment for adults and adolescents over 12 years who have severe persistent allergic asthma.
It recommended that Xolair be given marketing authorisation.

The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Xolair to Novartis Europharm Limited on 25 October 2005.
