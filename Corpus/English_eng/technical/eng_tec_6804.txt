An example template for Telephone cost accounting.
If you ca n't find a rule for your region you will have to write one by following the following template. Do n't be afraid though it is really easy.
Do n't forget to submit your newly created rules file to & kppp; 's maintainer. The newly created rules file can be checked for valid syntax with the -r rule_file command line option to & kppp; and must be installed in ${KDEDIR}/ share/ apps/ kppp/ Rules or in ${HOME}/. kde/ share/ apps/ kppp/ Rules before you will be able to select it in this dialog.
################################################################ # # Disclaimer/ License # This Template is (c) by Mario Weilguni & lt; mweilguni@kde. orggt; # It is licensed under the same terms as the kppp package, # which it is part of # ################################################################ # # This is a sample rule set for kppp. You can use it as a # template when you have to create your own ruleset. If you do # so, remove all comments and add your own. This will allow # other users to check your ruleset more easily. # # Please sign the tarif file with your name and email address # so that I can contact you if necessary. # # NOTE: the rules in this rule set do not make much sense and # are only for demonstration purposes # # NOTE ON FILENAMES: # when you create your own ruleset, use "_" in filename # instead of spaces and use ". rst as extension # i. e." Austria city calls "# -- > file should be saved as" Austria_city_calls. rst "# # Thanks, Bernd Wuebben # wuebben@math. cornell. edu / wuebben@kde. org ################################################################ ################################################################ # # NAME OF THE RULESET. This is NEEDED for accounting purposes. # ################################################################ name=default ################################################################ # currency settings ################################################################ # defines ATS (Austrian Schilling) to be used as currency # symbol (not absolutely needed, default =" $") currency_symbol=ATS # Define the position of the currency symbol. # (not absolutely needed, default is" right ") currency_position=right # Define the number of significant digits. # (not absolutely needed, default is" 2 "currency_digits=2 ################################################################ # connection settings ################################################################ # NOTE: rules are applied from top to bottom - the # LAST matching rule is the one used for the # cost computations. # This is charged whenever you connect. If you do n't have to # pay per-connection, use" 0 "here or comment it out. per_connection=0.0 # minimum costs per per connection. If the costs of a phone # call are less than this value, this value is used instead minimum_costs=0.0 # You pay .74 for the first 180 seconds (3 minutes) no matter # whether you are connected for 1 second or 180 seconds. # This rule will take priority during the first 180 seconds # over any other rule, in particular the'default 'rule. # have a look at costgraphs. gif in the docs directory # of the kppp distribution for a graphic illustration. flat_init_costs=(0.74,180) # This is the default rule which is used when no other rule # applies. The first component" 0.1 "is the price of one #" unit ", while" 72 "is the duration in seconds. # Therefore the following rule means:" Every 72 seconds 0.1 # ATS are added to the bill "default=(0.1, 72) # # more complicated rules: # #" on monday until sunday from 12:00 am until 11:59 pm the costs # are 0.2 each 72 seconds "on () between () use (0.2, 2) # same as above on (monday.. sunday) between () use (0.2, 2) # same as above. You must use 24 hour notation, or the accounting # will not work correctly. (Example: write 15:00 for 3 pm) on (monday.. sunday) between (0:00..23:59) use (0.2, 2) # applies on friday, saturday, sunday and monday 8am until 1pm on (friday.. monday) between (8:00..13:00) use(0.3,72) # ATTENTION: on(monday.. friday) between (21:00..5:00) use (0.4,2) # does NOT include saturday 0:00-5:00, just monday.. friday, as it says. # applies on a given date (christmas) on (12/ 25) between () use (0.3,72) # a range of dates and one weekday on (12/ 25..12/ 27, 12/ 31, 07/ 04, monday) between () use (0.4, 72) # use this for easter on (easter) between () use (0.3,72) # easter + 50 days (Pfingstmontag/ Pentecost Monday) on (easter+50) between () use (0.3,72) on (thursday) between (20:00..21:52) use (8.2, 1) # The" on() "rules above all relates to current time only. You can also # make a rule depend on the number of seconds you have been connected # by specifying this time as a third argument to" use() ". # For instance, let's say normal rate in the evening is 0.20 per minute, # and it drops by 20% after one hour of connect time. This can be modelled # like: on () between (19:30..08:00) use (0.20, 60) on () between (19:30..08:00) use (0.16, 60, 3600) # Note that these rules, just like other rules, are sensitive to the # order in which they appear.
