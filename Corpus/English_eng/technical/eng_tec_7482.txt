CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Pigs (sows and gilts).
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
For the reduction of clinical signs of progressive atrophic rhinitis in piglets by passive oral immunisation with colostrum from dams actively immunised with the vaccine.
4.3 Contra-indications
None.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species

2/ 17 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
A mean transient increase in body temperature of 1.5 °C, in some pigs up to 3 °C can generally be measured on the day of vaccination or the following day.
Reduced activity and lack of appetite in 10-20% of the animals may occur on the day of vaccination and/ or a transient swelling (max diameter:
10 cm) for up to two weeks may arise at the site of injection.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
This product can be used during pregnancy.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

One dose of 2 ml by intramuscular injection to pigs of 18 weeks of age and older.
The vaccine should preferably be administered just behind the ear.
Vaccination scheme:
Basic vaccination: inject one dose per pig, followed by a second injection 4 weeks after the first injection.
The first injection should be administered 6 weeks before the expected date of farrowing.
Revaccination: a single injection of one dose should be carried out 2 – 4 weeks prior to each subsequent farrowing.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Apart from a higher average transient increase in body temperature on the day of vaccination or the following day, no adverse reactions other than already mentioned under point 4.6 can be expected.
4.11 Withdrawal period
Zero days.
5.
IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: inactivated bacterial vaccine.
ATCvet code:
QI09AB04.
To stimulate active immunity in order to provide passive immunity to atrophic rhinitis.
the progeny against progressive
Dermonecrotic toxin producing Pasteurella multocida is the pathogen responsible for turbinate atrophy in progressive atrophic rhinitis.
Colonisation of the surface of the nasal mucosa by Pasteurella multocida is most often promoted by Bordetella bronchiseptica.
The vaccine contains a non-toxic recombinant derivative of the Pasteurella multocida toxin and inactivated Bordetella bronchiseptica cells.
The
3/ 17 immunogens are incorporated in an adjuvant based on dl-α -tocopherol.
Neonatal piglets derive passive immunity via ingestion of colostrum from vaccinated sows/ gilts.
6.

Do not mix with any other vaccine or immunological product.
6.2 Shelf-life
5 years.
Shelf-life after first opening the vial:
