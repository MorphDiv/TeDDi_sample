Filtering out files
When you compare folders, you may want to be able to ignore some files. For example, you may wish to only see files that are present and different in both folders, ignoring those that are the same or only exist in one folder. Alternatively, you might want to ignore all the files in your

There are several different parts to a file comparison. The most important parts are the editors where your files appear. In addition to these editors, the areas around and between your files give you a visual overview and actions to help you handle changes between the files.
On the left and right-hand sides of the window, there are two small vertical bars showing various coloured blocks. These bars are designed to give you an overview of all of the differences between your two files. Each coloured block represents a section that is inserted, deleted, changed or in conflict between your files, depending on the block's colour used.
In between each pair of files is a segment that shows how the changed sections between your files correspond to each other. You can click on the arrows in a segment to replace sections in one file with sections from the other. You can also delete, copy or merge changes. For details on what you can do with individual change segments, see
Saving your changes
Once you've finished editing your files, you need to save each file you've changed.
You can tell whether your files have been saved since they last changed by the save icon that appears next to the file name above each file. Also, the notebook label will show an asterisk (

What is Meld?


Getting started comparing folders

Your selected folders will be shown as side-by-side trees, with differences between files in each folder highlighted. You can copy or delete files from either folder, or compare individual text files in more detail.
The folder comparison view
The main parts of a folder comparison are the trees showing the folders you're comparing. You can easily
There are bars on the left and right-hand sides of the window that show you a simple coloured summary of the comparison results. Each file or folder in the comparison corresponds to a small section of these bars, though

This is version 0.1 of the meld manual, describing meld 0.9.6
Meld views differences between files and between directories. Meld makes it easy to isolate and merge these differences.
Starting meld
meld
start meld with the new document dialog
meld &lt;filegt; &lt;filegt; [file]
start meld with either a two way or three way file comparison
meld &lt;dirgt; &lt;dirgt; [dir]
meld &lt;dir|filegt;
start meld with the source control browser
"lt;gt;" surround required arguments, "[]" surround optional arguments and "|" indicates a choice.
File Comparison
Starting
To compare files, choose
For two way comparisons the original is shown in the left pane and the modified version in the right pane by convention.
For three way comparisons, the original is shown in the centre pane and the left and right panes show the modified versions. By convention we put the locally modified file in the right pane.
Change Summary
The location of the changes is summarised in the window margins at the far left and right. By default green marks insertions and deletions and blue marks changes.
You can jump to an individual change by clicking in the margin or using the scrollbar.
Detailed View
Detailed differences are shown in the text and central pane. Inserted text is shown with a solid background. Lines containing changes are marked with a light background with the individual changes highlighted with a stronger colour.
The area between each file shows where each change occurs in the other file. You can scroll through the changes by rolling the mouse wheel over this area or with keyboard shortcuts
Editing
You can edit the files as you would in a normal text editor. The differences will update automatically. Use
You can also apply changes by clicking the merge buttons ("
You can apply all the changes from a given file by right clicking a text pane and choosing
You can ignore certain types of differences in order to locate important differences. All these settings are available in the Text Filters section of the
Regular Expressions
See the python re module for more information on regular expressions
Differences are computed line-by-line so multiline regulare expressions will likely have unintended consequences.
When comparing files, each selected regular expression is run in turn over each line of input. Anything matching the expression is removed from the input.
Blank Lines
Changes which insert or remove blank lines can be ignored. This option is most useful in conjunction with one or more regular expression filters.
Saving
When you have unsaved changes, a disk icon will appear beside the file name of the changed file. The tab label and window title also have an asterix after the file name.
To save a file, choose
Status Bar
The status bar shows the cursor location (line and column) and also progress messages as files are initially loaded and compared.
To compare directories, choose
Similarly to the file comparison, the window margins mark file deletions, creations and modifications.
Modified files are highlighted with red, created files with green and deleted files with a strikethrough. See also
The file or folder most recently modified has a red dot superimposed on its icon. More detailed information such as file permission and modification time can be seen in the status bar when a file is selected.
Use the mouse or the the cursor keys
Activate an item with double click or
Additional options are available from a right click context menu.
Use Shift+Click and Control+Click to select multiple items.
Often the initial comparison will contain too much spurious information. You can use filters to isolate the differences which are important to you.
Explicit Hiding
Use the toolbar button to hide an item (and all subitems for directories).
By default filename comparisons are case sensitive. Use the toolbar button to toggle case sensitivty of filenames.
State Filtering
Modified (there is some content difference between files which are present)
New (there is no content difference between present files, but the file is missing from at least one directory)
Identical (all files have equal content and are all present)
All items have a state which is one of:
In the current version, only files are filtered by state. Directories are always shown.
Use the toolbar buttons to control which items are shown by their state.
Meld can hide certain filename patterns from the comparison using the toolbar buttons. Customise the file patterns that are hidden in the File Filters section of the
Content Filtering
If differences between files exist, but all differences match the active regular expressions specified in Text Filters section of the
Source Control
To browse a working copy of a source control repository, choose
The browser is used for examining and commiting or reverting local changes. It is not intended to be a complete source control client.
The browser can filter on four states. To show or hide all files in a particular state, select or deselect the corresponding toggle button in the toolbar.
The file has not changed since it was checked out or committed.
The file has been locally changed, added, or removed.
The file is explicitly ignored e.g. though a
The
Viewing Differences
Activating an unmodified file opens it in the file viewer. Activating a modified file opens up a two way diff to examine your changes.
You can examine many changes at once using Shift+Click and Control+Click to select multiple items.
The toolbar contains commands to perform the most common source control operations. These operations are also accessible through a context menu.
Viewing Console
At the bottom of the source control window is an expander containing all the source control operations and their output. Click the expander bar to toggle between hiding and showing the console.
