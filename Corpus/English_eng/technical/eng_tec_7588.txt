See section 4.7 (pregnancy and lactation).
4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established in cats weighing less than 2.5 kg or under 4 months of age.
Use in cats with impaired cardiac, renal or hepatic function or in cats that are dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive may involve additional risks.
If use cannot be avoided, these cats require careful monitoring.
Use this veterinary medicinal product under strict veterinary monitoring in cats with a risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, or if the cat previously displayed intolerance to other NSAIDs.
2 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals Wash hands after use of the veterinary medicinal product.
In small children, accidental ingestion increases the risk for NSAID adverse effects.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
For pregnant women, particularly near term pregnant women, prolonged dermal exposure increases the risk for premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the foetus.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)*
Mild and transient diarrhoea, soft faeces or vomiting were commonly reported.
* The frequency of possible adverse effects is defined using the following convention: very common (affects more than 1 animal in 10) common (affects 1 to 10 animals in 100) uncommon (affects 1 to 10 animals in 1,000) rare (affects 1 to 10 animals in 10,000) very rare (affects less than 1 animals in 10,000) not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in pregnant and lactating animals because the safety of robenacoxib has not been established during pregnancy and lactation or in cats used for breeding.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Onsior must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs.
Pre-treatment with other anti- inflammatory medicines may result in additional or increased adverse effects and, accordingly a treatment-free period with such substances should be observed for at least 24 hours before the commencement of treatment with Onsior.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Concomitant treatment with medicines displaying action on renal flow, e. g. diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be subject to clinical monitoring.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic medicines should be avoided as there might be an increased risk of renal toxicity.
Concurrent use of other active substances that have a high degree of protein binding may compete with robenacoxib for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For oral use.
Give either without food or with a small amount of food.
Onsior tablets are easy to administer and well accepted by most cats.
The tablets should not be divided or broken.
The recommended dose of robenacoxib is 1 mg/ kg body weight with a range 1-2.4 mg/ kg.
Administer once daily at the same time every day, for up to 6 days according to the table below.
3
Body weight (kg) 2.5 to < 6 6 to < 12
Number of tablets 1 tablet 2 tablets
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
In healthy young cats aged 7-8 months, oral robenacoxib administered at high overdoses (4, 12, or 20 mg/ kg/ day for 6 weeks) did not produce any signs of toxicity, including no evidence of any gastrointestinal, kidney or liver toxicity and no effect on bleeding time.
As with any NSAID, overdose may cause gastrointestinal, kidney, or liver toxicity in sensitive or compromised cats.
There is no specific antidote.
Symptomatic, supportive therapy is recommended and should consist of administration of gastrointestinal protective agents and infusion of isotonic saline.
4.11 Withdrawal periods
Not applicable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products, non-steroids, coxibs.
ATCvet code:
QM01AH91.
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Robenacoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the coxib class.
It is a potent and selective inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme (COX-2).
The cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) is present in two forms.
COX-1 is the constitutive form of the enzyme and has protective functions, e. g. in the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
COX-2 is the inducible form of the enzyme which is responsible for the production of mediators including PGE2 which induce pain, inflammation or fever.
In the in vitro whole blood assay in cats, robenacoxib was approximately 500 fold selective for COX-2 (IC50 0.058 µM) as compared to COX-1 (IC50 28.9 µM).
1-2 mg/ kg robenacoxib tablets produced a marked inhibition of COX-2 activity in cats and had no effect on COX-1 activity.
In an inflammation model in cats, robenacoxib injection had analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic actions and a rapid onset of action (0.5 h).
In clinical trials in cats, robenacoxib tablets reduced pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Absorption After oral administration of robenacoxib tablets at approximately 2 mg/ kg without food, peak blood concentrations are attained rapidly with a Tmax of 0.5 h, a Cmax of 1159 ng/ ml and an AUC of 1337 ng. h/ ml.
Co-administration of robenacoxib tablets with one third of the daily food ration produced no change in Tmax (0.5 h), Cmax (1201 ng/ ml) or AUC (1383 ng. h/ ml).
Co-administration of robenacoxib tablets with the entire daily food ration produced no delay in Tmax (0.5 h), but a lower Cmax (691 ng/ ml) and a slightly lower AUC (1069 ng. h/ ml).
The systemic bioavailability of robenacoxib tablets was 49% without food.
Distribution Robenacoxib has a relatively small volume of distribution (Vss 190 ml/ kg) and is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%).
4 Biotransformation Robenacoxib is extensively metabolised by the liver in cats Apart from one lactam metabolite, the identity of other metabolites is not known in cats
Elimination Robenacoxib is rapidly cleared from blood (CL 0.44 L/ kg/ h) with an elimination t1/ 2 of 1.1 h after intravenous administration.
After oral administration of tablets, the terminal half-life from blood was 1.7 h.
Robenacoxib persists longer and at higher concentrations at sites of inflammation than in blood.
Robenacoxib is excreted predominantly via the biliary route (∼ 70%) rather than via the kidneys (∼ 30%).
The pharmacokinetics of robenacoxib do not differ between male and female cats.

4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
For the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with chronic osteoarthritis in dogs.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in dogs suffering from gastrointestinal ulceration or with hepatic disease.
Do not use concomitantly with corticosteroids or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
See section 4.7 (pregnancy and lactation).
4.4 Special warnings
In clinical studies, inadequate response to treatment was seen in 10-15% of the dogs.
7 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established in dogs weighing less than 2.5 kg or under 3 months of age.
For long term therapy, liver enzymes should be monitored at the start of therapy, e. g. after 2, 4 and 8 weeks.
Thereafter it is recommended to continue regular monitoring, e. g. every 3-6 months.
Therapy should be discontinued if liver enzyme activities increase markedly or the dog shows clinical signs such as anorexia, apathy or vomiting in combination with elevated liver enzymes.
Use in dogs with impaired cardiac or renal function or dogs that are dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive may involve additional risks.
If use cannot be avoided, these dogs require careful monitoring.
Use this product under strict veterinary monitoring in dogs with a risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, or if the dog previously displayed intolerance to other NSAIDs.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Wash hands after use of the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
In small children, accidental ingestion increases the risk for NSAID adverse effects.
For pregnant women, particularly near term pregnant women, prolonged dermal exposure increases the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the foetus.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)*
Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported very commonly, but most cases were mild and recovered without treatment.
Vomiting and soft faeces were very common, decreased appetite and diarrhoea were common, and blood in the faeces was uncommon.
In dogs treated up to 2 weeks no increases in liver enzyme activities were observed.
However, with long-term treatment, increases in liver enzyme activities were common.
In most cases there were no clinical signs and the liver enzyme activities either stabilised or decreased with continued treatment.
Increases in liver enzyme activities associated with clinical signs of anorexia, apathy or vomiting were uncommon.
* The frequency of possible adverse effects is defined using the following convention: very common (affects more than 1 animal in 10) common (affects 1 to 10 animals in 100) uncommon (affects 1 to 10 animals in 1,000) rare (affects 1 to 10 animals in 10,000) very rare (affects less than 1 animals in 10,000) not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in pregnant or lactating dogs because the safety of robenacoxib has not been established during pregnancy and lactation or in dogs used for breeding.
8 4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Onsior must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs.
Pre-treatment with other anti- inflammatory medicines may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such substances should be observed for at least 24 hours before the commencement of treatment with Onsior.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Concomitant treatment with medicines displaying action on renal flow, e. g. diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be subject to clinical monitoring.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic medicines should be avoided as there might be an increased risk of renal toxicity.
Concurrent use of other active substances that have a high degree of protein binding may compete with robenacoxib for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For oral use.
Do not administer with food since clinical trials demonstrated better efficacy of robenacoxib when administered without food or at least 30 minutes before or after a meal.
Onsior tablets are flavoured and are taken voluntarily by most dogs.
The tablets should not be divided or broken.
The recommended dose of robenacoxib is 1 mg/ kg body weight with a range 1-2 mg/ kg.
Administer once daily at the same time every day according to the table below.
Number of tablets Body weight (kg)
5 mg

1 tablet
1 tablet 2 tablets
A clinical response is normally seen within a week.
Treatment should be discontinued after 10 days if no clinical improvement is apparent.
For long-term treatment, once clinical response has been observed, the dose of Onsior can be adjusted to the lowest effective individual dose reflecting that the degree of pain and inflammation associated with chronic osteoartritis may vary over time.
Regular monitoring should be undertaken by the veterinarian.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
In healthy young dogs aged 5-6 months, oral robenacoxib administered at high overdoses (4, 6, or 10 mg/ kg/ day for 6 months) did not produce any signs of toxicity, including no evidence of any gastrointestinal, kidney or liver toxicity and no effect on bleeding time.
Robenacoxib also had no detrimental effects on cartilages or joints.
As with any NSAID, overdose may cause gastrointestinal, kidney, or liver toxicity in sensitive or compromised dogs.
There is no specific antidote.
Symptomatic, supportive therapy is recommended consisting of administration of gastrointestinal protective agents and infusion of isotonic saline.

Robenacoxib produced marked inhibition of COX-2 activity and had no effect on COX-1 activity in dogs at oral doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/ kg.
Robenacoxib tablets are therefore COX-1 sparing at recommended doses in dogs.
Robenacoxib had analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions in an inflammation model in dogs with single oral doses ranging from 0.5 to 8 mg/ kg, with an ID50 of 0.8 mg/ kg and a rapid onset of action (0.5 h).
In clinical trials robenacoxib reduced the lameness and inflammation of dogs with chronic osteoarthritis and reduced pain and inflammation after orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery in dogs.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Absorption After oral administration of robenacoxib flavoured tablets at 1 mg/ kg without food, peak blood concentrations are attained rapidly with a Tmax of 0.5 h, a Cmax of 1124 ng/ ml and an AUC of 1249 ng. h/ ml.
Co-administration of robenacoxib non-flavoured tablets with food produced no delay in Tmax, but slightly lower values for Cmax (832 ng/ ml) and AUC (782 ng. h/ ml).
The systemic bioavailability of robenacoxib tablets in dogs was 62% with food and 84% without food.
Distribution Robenacoxib has a relatively small volume of distribution (Vss 240 ml/ kg) and is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%).
Biotransformation Robenacoxib is extensively metabolised by the liver in dogs.
Apart from one lactam metabolite, the identity of other metabolites is not known in dogs.
Elimination Robenacoxib is cleared rapidly from blood (CL 0.81 L/ kg/ h) with an elimination t1/ 2 of 0.7 h after intravenous administration.
After oral administration of the tablets, the terminal half-life in blood was 1.2 h.
Robenacoxib persists longer and at higher concentrations at sites of inflammation than in blood.
Robenacoxib is excreted predominately via the biliary route (∼ 65%) and the remainder via the kidneys.
Repeated oral administration of robenacoxib to dogs at dosages of 2 -10 mg/ kg for 6 months produced no change in the blood profile, with neither accumulation of robenacoxib nor enzyme induction.
Accumulation of metabolites has not been tested.
The pharmacokinetics of robenacoxib do not differ between male and female dogs, and are linear over the range 0.5-8 mg/ kg.

4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in pregnant and lactating animals because the safety of robenacoxib has not been established during pregnancy and lactation or in cats and dogs used for breeding.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Onsior must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs.
Pre-treatment with other anti- inflammatory medicines may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such substances should be observed for at least 24 hours before the commencement of treatment with Onsior.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Concomitant treatment with medicines displaying action on renal flow, e. g. diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be subject to clinical monitoring.
As anaesthetics may affect renal perfusion, the use of parenteral fluid therapy during surgery should be considered to decrease potential renal complications when using NSAIDs peri-operatively.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic medicines should be avoided as there might be an increased risk of renal toxicity.
14 Concurrent use of other active substances that have a high degree of protein binding may compete with robenacoxib for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Subcutaneous use.
Administer subcutaneously to cats or dogs approximately 30 minutes before the start of surgery, for example around the time of induction of general anaesthesia, at a dose of 1 ml per 10 kg of body weight (2 mg/ kg).
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
In healthy young dogs aged 6 months, once daily subcutaneous administration of robenacoxib at doses of 2 (recommended therapeutic dose; RTD), 6 (3 times RTD), and 20 mg/ kg (10 times RTD) for 9 administrations over a 5 week period (3 cycles of 3 consecutive once daily injections) did not produce any signs of toxicity, including no gastrointestinal, kidney or liver toxicity and no effect on bleeding time.
Reversible inflammation at the injection site was noted in all groups (including controls) and was more severe in the 6 and 20 mg/ kg dose groups.
In healthy young cats aged 10 months, once daily subcutaneous administration of robenacoxib at doses of 4 mg/ kg (twice RTD) for 2 consecutive days and 10 mg/ kg (5 times RTD) for 3 consecutive days did not produce any signs of toxicity, including no signs of gastrointestinal, kidney or liver toxicity and no effect on bleeding time.
Reversible, minimal injection site reactions were noted in both dose groups.
As with any NSAID, overdose may cause gastrointestinal, kidney, or liver toxicity in sensitive or compromised animals.
There is no specific antidote.
Symptomatic, supportive therapy is recommended consisting of administration of gastrointestinal protective agents and infusion of isotonic saline.

COX-2 is the inducible form of the enzyme and is responsible for the production of mediators including PGE2 which induce pain, inflammation or fever.
In cats, using an in vitro whole blood assay, robenacoxib was approximately 500 fold selective for COX-2 (IC50 0.058 µM) as compared to COX-1 (IC50 28.9 µM).
In vivo, robenacoxib solution for injection produced marked inhibition of COX-2 activity and had no effect on COX-1 activity.
At the recommended dosage (2 mg/ kg), analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects were demonstrated in an inflammation model, and in clinical trials, robenacoxib reduced pain and inflammation in cats undergoing soft tissue surgery.
15 In dogs, robenacoxib was in vitro approximately 140 fold selective for COX-2 (IC50 0.04 µM) as compared to COX-1 (IC50 7.9 µM).
In vivo, robenacoxib solution for injection produced marked inhibition of COX-2 activity and had no effect on COX-1 activity.
At dosages ranging from 0.25 to 4 mg/ kg, robenacoxib had analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects in an inflammation model with a rapid onset of action (1 h).
In clinical trials at the recommended dose (2 mg/ kg), robenacoxib reduced pain and inflammation in dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Absorption Peak blood concentrations of robenacoxib are attained rapidly after subcutaneous injection in cats and dogs.
After a dosage of 2 mg/ kg a Tmax of 1 h (cats and dogs), a Cmax of 1464 ng/ ml (cats) and 615 ng/ ml (dogs), and an AUC of 3128 ng. h/ ml (cats) and 2180 ng. h/ ml (dogs) is obtained.
After a subcutaneous administration of 1 mg/ kg the systemic bioavailability is 69% in cats and 88% in dogs.
Distribution Robenacoxib has a relatively small volume of distribution (Vss of 190 ml/ kg in cats and 240 ml/ kg in dogs) and is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99%).
Biotransformation Robenacoxib is extensively metabolised by the liver in cats and dogs.
Apart from one lactam metabolite, the identity of other metabolites is not known in cats or dogs.
Elimination After intravenous administration robenacoxib was rapidly cleared from blood (CL of 0.44 L/ kg/ h in cats and 0.81 L/ kg/ h in dogs) with an elimination t1/ 2 of 1.1 h in cats and 0.8 h in dogs.
After subcutaneous administration, the terminal half-life from blood was 1.1 h in cats and 1.2 h in dogs.
Robenacoxib persists longer and in higher concentrations at sites of inflammation than in blood.
Robenacoxib is excreted predominately via the biliary route in cats (∼ 70%) and dogs (∼ 65%) and the remainder via the kidneys.
Repeated subcutaneous administration at dosages of 2 -20 mg/ kg produced no change in the blood profile, with neither bioaccumulation of robenacoxib nor enzyme induction.
Bioaccumulation of metabolites has not been tested.
The pharmacokinetics of robenacoxib injection do not differ between male and female cats and dogs, and are linear over the range of 0.25-4 mg/ kg in dogs.

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
The safety of this veterinary medicinal product has not been established in cats weighing less than 2.5 kg or under 4 months of age.
Use in cats with impaired function of the heart, kidneys or liver or in cats that are dehydrated, have low volume of circulating blood or have low blood pressure may involve additional risks.
If use cannot be avoided, these cats require careful monitoring.
Use this veterinary medicinal product under strict veterinary monitoring in cats at risk of stomach ulcer or if the animal previously displayed intolerance to other NSAIDs.
Onsior must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs.
Pre-treatment with other anti- inflammatory medicines may result in additional or increased adverse effects and a treatment-free period with such substances should be observed for at least 24 hours before the commencement of treatment with Onsior.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Concomitant treatment with medicines displaying action on renal flow, e. g. diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be subject to clinical monitoring.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic medicines should be avoided as there might be an increased risk of renal toxicity.
Concurrent use of other active substances that have a high degree of protein binding may compete with robenacoxib for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
For the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Wash hands after use of the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
In small children, accidental ingestion increases the risk for NSAID adverse effects.
For pregnant women, particularly near term pregnant women, prolonged dermal exposure may increase the risk to the foetus.
13.
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED PRODUCT OR WASTE MATERIALS, IF ANY
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
Ask your veterinary surgeon how to dispose of medicines no longer required.

OTHER INFORMATION
Onsior tablets for cats are available in cardboard boxes containing 1, 2 or 10 blisters.
Each blister contains 7 tablets.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
Robenacoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
It selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme (COX-2), which is responsible for pain, inflammation or fever.
The cyclooxygenase 1 enzyme (COX-1) which has protective functions, e. g. in the digestive tract and kidneys, is not inhibited by robenacoxib.
This product reduced pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders in clinical trials in cats.
For any information about this veterinary medicinal product, please contact the local representative of the marketing authorisation holder.

A clinical response is normally seen within a week.
Treatment should be discontinued after 10 days if no clinical improvement is apparent.
47 For long-term treatment, once clinical response has been observed, the dose of Onsior can be adjusted to the lowest effective individual dose reflecting that the degree of pain and inflammation associated with chronic osteoartritis may vary over time.
Regular monitoring should be undertaken by the veterinarian.
9.
ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
Give orally.
Do not administer with food since clinical trials demonstrated better efficacy of robenacoxib when administered without food or at least 30 minutes before or after a meal.
Onsior tablets are flavoured and are taken voluntarily by most dogs.
The tablets should not be divided or broken.
10.
WITHDRAWAL PERIOD
Not applicable

Do not use after the expiry date stated on the blister after EXP.
12.
SPECIAL WARNING(S)
The safety of this veterinary medicinal product has not been established in dogs weighing less than 2.5 kg or under 3 months of age.
For long term therapy, liver enzymes should be monitored at the start of therapy, e. g. after 2, 4 and 8 weeks.
Thereafter it is recommended to continue regular monitoring, e. g. every 3-6 months.
Therapy should be discontinued if liver enzyme activities increase markedly or the dog shows symptoms such as anorexia, apathy or vomiting in combination with elevated liver enzymes.
Use in dogs with impaired function of the heart, kidneys or liver or in dogs that are dehydrated, have low volume of circulating blood or have low blood pressure may involve additional risk.
If use cannot be avoided, these dogs require careful monitoring.
Use this veterinary medicinal product under strict veterinary monitoring in dogs at risk of stomach ulcer or if the animal previously displayed intolerance to other NSAIDs.
Onsior must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs.
Pre-treatment with other anti- inflammatory medicines may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such substances should be observed for at least 24 hours before the commencement of treatment with Onsior.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Concomitant treatment with medicines displaying action on renal flow, e. g. diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be subject to clinical monitoring.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic medicines should be avoided as there might be an increased risk of renal toxicity.
Concurrent use of other active substances that have a high degree of protein binding may compete with robenacoxib for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
48 For the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Wash hands after use of the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
In small children, accidental ingestion increases the risk for NSAID adverse effects.
For pregnant women, particularly near term pregnant women, prolonged dermal exposure might increase the risk to the foetus.
13.
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED PRODUCT OR WASTE MATERIALS, IF ANY
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
Ask your veterinary surgeon how to dispose of medicines no longer required.

OTHER INFORMATION
Onsior tablets for dogs are available in cardboard boxes containing 1, 2, 4 or 10 blisters.
Each blister contains 7 tablets.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
Robenacoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
It selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme (COX-2), which is responsible for pain, inflammation or fever.
The cyclooxygenase 1 enzyme (COX-1) which has protective functions, e. g. in the digestive tract and kidneys, is not inhibited by robenacoxib.
In artificially induced inflammation in dogs, robenacoxib reduced pain and inflammation with single oral doses ranging from 0.5 to 8 mg/ kg and a rapid onset of action (0.5 h).
This product reduced in clinical trials the lameness and inflammation of dogs with chronic osteoarthritis.

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
The safety of this veterinary medicinal product has not been established in cats less than 4 months of age and in dogs less than 2 months of age, or in cats or dogs less than 2.5 kg body weight.
Use in animals with impaired function of the heart, kidneys or liver or in animals that are dehydrated, have low volume of circulating blood or have low blood pressure may involve additional risks.
If use cannot be avoided, these animals require careful monitoring and fluid therapy.
Use this veterinary medicinal product under strict veterinary monitoring in animals at risk of ulceration of the digestive tract, or if the animal previously displayed intolerance to other NSAIDs.
Onsior must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs.
Pre-treatment with other anti- inflammatory medicines may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such substances should be observed for at least 24 hours before the commencement of treatment with Onsior.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Concomitant treatment with medicines displaying action on renal flow, e. g. diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be subject to clinical monitoring.
As anaesthetics may affect renal perfusion, the use of parenteral fluid therapy during surgery should be considered to decrease potential renal complications when using NSAIDs peri-operatively.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic medicines should be avoided as there might be an increased risk of renal toxicity.
Concurrent use of other active substances that have a high degree of protein binding may compete with robenacoxib for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
In the absence of compatibility studies, this veterinary medicinal product must not be mixed with other veterinary medicinal products.
For the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Wash hands and exposed skin immediately after use of the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion or self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
For pregnant women, particularly near term pregnant women, accidental injection and prolonged dermal exposure might increase the risk to the foetus.
