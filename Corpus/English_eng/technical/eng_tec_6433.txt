When you move the mouse over & kruler;, your cursor will turn into an elongated arrow, with a circle at one end. As you move the cursor, & kruler; will display how far from the point marked 0 the circle on the end of the cursor currently is. & kruler; will also display the & HTML; color code of the color currently under the circle. This is very useful for picking out colors from an image. If you move the mouse far enough that the arrow cursor is no longer touching & kruler;, the cursor will revert to normal, allowing you to carry on working with your other applications.
You can change the orientation using the context menu, described in the next chapter.
