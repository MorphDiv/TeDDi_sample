Adding Chapter Numbers to Captions
You can include chapter numbers in captions.
Ensure that the text in your document is organised by chapters, and that the chapter titles and, if you want, the section titles, use one of the predefined heading paragraph styles.
You must also assign a numbering option to the heading paragraph styles.
