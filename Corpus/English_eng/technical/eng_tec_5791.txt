& kpager; gives you a thumbnail view of all virtual desktops.
KDE

kpager
desktop
overview
Introduction
& kpager; gives you a thumbnail sketch of all your desktops. It is a handy tool to let you see, resize or close windows on any desktop and move windows around within or between desktops.
Using & kpager;
Here's a screenshot of & kpager;
Screenshot
More & kpager; features
& kpager; can show all virtual desktops and the applications within them. It can be used to choose an application or even to move applications within virtual desktops or to others.
Command Reference
The main & kpager; window
Using the mouse
In & kpager; you can activate applications by clicking them with the left button.
The middle button of the mouse can be used for dragging applications within & kpager;. Applications can either be moved within a virtual desktop or to another one.
Clicking the right mouse button anywhere in & kpager; will open a context menu.
The Context Menu
The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: If it is clicked on the empty background of & kpager;, it only has two items: Configure KPager and Quit. Otherwise, if clicked on a window, there are also the name and the icon of the application, and Minimize, Maximize, To Desktop and Close are displayed. See below for a detailed description of the menu items.
Maximize
Maximizes the application window to the whole desktop. This item only appears if right clicked on an application window.
Minimize
Iconifies the application. This item only appears if right clicked on an application window.
To Desktop
Sends the application window to the chosen virtual desktop. This item only appears if right clicked on an application window.
Close
Closes the clicked application. This item only appears if right clicked on an application window.
Configure Pager
Opens the settings dialog.
Quit
Quits & kpager;.
The Settings Dialog
Here's a screenshot of the settings dialog
In the settings dialog you will find five check boxes and two groups of radio buttons.
Enable Window Dragging
If this box is checked, you can drag windows inside of & kpager; with the & MMB;. Windows can be dragged over the desktop or even to another desktop.
Show Name
If this box is checked, the names of the desktops are shown in the main view of & kpager;.
Show Number
If this box is checked, the numbers of the desktops are shown in the main view of & kpager;. If it is checked together with the Show Name box, the name is displayed with ordinals, & eg; 1. Desktop.
Show Background
If this box is checked, the wallpaper of each desktop - if set - will be shown as backgrounds in & kpager;, too.
Show Windows
If this box is checked, the applications on the desktops are shown in & kpager; as small views. Otherwise, & kpager; will remain empty, just for choosing the virtual desktops.
Type of Window
This group of radio buttons sets the kind of view for the application window views. Plain will show just empty rectangles with the proportions of the application window, Icon will show them with their standard icon and Pixmap with a small view of the contents of the application window. Note that using the pixmap mode is only recommended for very fast machines.
Layout
In this group the layout of the & kpager; main view can be set. Classical will show & kpager; in a 2xn grid like pager applications in some other window managers, Horizontal will show the virtual desktops in a horizontal view and Vertical in a vertical row, which may perfectly fit on the side of the desktop.
Questions and Answers
Why could I need & kpager;?
& kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager applet in the panel. It has the advantage of being resizeable and within this able to show icon or pixmap views of the running applications, move the windows across desktops and run outside of the panel.
How can I change the behavior of & kpager;?
Clicking the right mouse button anywhere within & kpager; lets you chose Configure from the context menu for displaying the settings dialog
Windows are transparent by default, how do I turn this off?
Currently, you cannot turn that option off within the config dialog, but you can do it manually like this:
Open the file $KDEHOME/ share/ config/ kpagerrc with any text editor like & kedit; or vi. If you have no rights to write that file, you may need to do it as root or contact your system administrator. In this file you will have to add a new key with the name windowTransparentMode with a number as value. Values are:
0 - No transparent windows at all.
1 - Only maximized windows are transparent.
2 - all windows are transparent (default).
