(PHP 3, PHP 4)
linkinfo() returns the st_dev field of the UNIX C stat structure returned by the lstat system call.
This function is used to verify if a link (pointed to by path) really exists (using the same method as the S_ISLNK macro defined in stat.h).
Returns 0 or FALSE in case of error.
See also symlink(), link(), and readlink().
