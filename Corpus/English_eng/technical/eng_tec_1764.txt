Imp operator (logical)
Imp Operator [Run-time]
Performs a logical implication on two expressions.
Syntax:
Result = Expression1 Imp Expression2
Parameters:
Result:
A numerical variable that will contain the result of the implication.
Expression1, Expression2:
Boolean or numerical expressions that you want to evaluate with the Imp operator.
If you use the Imp operator in Boolean expressions, False is only returned if the first expression evaluates to True and the second expression to False.
If you use the Imp operator in bit expressions, a bit is cleared from the result if the corresponding bit is set in the first expression and the corresponding bit is clear in the second expression.
Example:
Sub ExampleImp
Dim A as Variant, B as Variant, C as Variant, D as Variant
Dim vOut as Variant
A = 10:
B = 8:
C = 6:
D = Null
vOut = A > B Imp B > C REM returns -1
vOut = B > A Imp B > C REM returns -1
vOut = A > B Imp B > D REM returns 0
vOut = (B > D Imp B > A) REM returns -1
vOut = B Imp A REM returns -1
End Sub
