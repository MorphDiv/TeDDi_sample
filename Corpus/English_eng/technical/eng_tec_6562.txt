Handbook
SimpleViewer is a Flash component which is free to use, but uses a license which comes into conflict with several distributions. Due to the license it is not possible to ship it with this plugin. You can now download SimpleViewer from its homepage and point this tool to the downloaded archive. The archive will be stored with the plugin configuration, so it is available for further use.
1.) Download SimpleViewer Version 1.9. x
2.) Point this tool to the downloaded archive
