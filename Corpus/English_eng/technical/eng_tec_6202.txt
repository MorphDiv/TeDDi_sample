There is no Inbox found in any resource. Starting a new message will cause the message to be lost after you have sent it. You will not have a local copy anymore. If you want a copy, one way to do this is to add yourself as a CC to the message.
Cannot save the message
Loading external images gives spammers the acknowledgement that you received this message so they will use your email address to spam you. So you should only continue for very trusted messages.
