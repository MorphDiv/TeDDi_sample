Questions and Answers
Can I run & konqueror; from another window manager?
Just install & Qt;, kdelibs and kdebase, and from your favorite window manager, launch & konqueror;. It should work just fine, but if it does n't (kde; developers do n't test that case often), report it to http: / /bugs. kde. org and try running kdeinit before running & konqueror;; it usually helps.
Where does & konqueror; keep all its configuration data?
Generally in the ~/. kde folder (this may be ~/. kde3 on your system, depending on how & kde; 3 was installed). Do n't alter these files unless you really know what you are doing.
The ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqueror/ profiles folder holds individual files containing settings for each of your profiles.
Your bookmarks are held in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqueror/ bookmarks. xml
Cookies are held in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ kcookiejar/ cookies
Your history, as used for the auto-completion feature, is in ~/. kde/ share/ config/ konq_history
In the folder ~/. kde/ share/ config/ the files konqiconviewrc, konqlistviewrc and konquerorrc hold a whole lot of general configuration settings.
The folder ~/. kde/ share/ cache/ http/ contains the browser cache.
The Navigation Panel uses the files and subfolders in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqsidebartng
Any folder specific view settings are put into. directory files in the individual folders.
How do I clear out the history file?
There are two histories:
One is used for text completion in the Location Toolbar text entry box. To clear this right click on the text entry box and select Clear History.
The other is the log of visited locations. Select the History page in the Navigation Panel, right click on an entry and choose Remove Entry to remove just that entry or Clear History to delete all entries.
How do I enable, disable or clear the browser cache?
If you select Cache in the dialog launched by selecting Settings Configure Konqueror..., you will be presented with a dialog box that lets you disable the cache, clear it or set its size, and change the caching policy.
How can I change the timeout values used by & konqueror; when web browsing?
In the Control Center Internet & Network Preferences page.
How do I set my home page - the page loaded on startup?
Start & konqueror; with the Web Browser icon on the panel. Open the page you want to be loaded in any new Web Browser window and select Save View Profile "Web Browsing" from the Settings menu.
All new & konqueror; windows that are started with the Web Browser icon on the panel, or from the location menu, and new empty tabs, will now start at this page.
This does not change the behavior of the Home button on the & konqueror; toolbar, which will continue to take you to the & URI; defined in the & konqueror; configuration module. You can reach that module from within & konqueror;, via Settings Configure Konqueror Behavior. By default this is set to ~, which is your Home folder. You may set this to any & URI;, either local or remote, and pressing the Home icon on the toolbar will display it.
To have & konqueror; start up with no page loaded, use about: blank.
I ca n't find the answer to my question here.
