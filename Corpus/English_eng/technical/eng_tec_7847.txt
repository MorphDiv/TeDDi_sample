EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
NUTROPINAQ
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is NutropinAq?
NutropinAq is a solution for injection in a cartridge.
Each cartridge contains 10 mg (corresponding to 30 IU) of the active substance somatropin.
What is NutropinAq used for?
NutropinAq is used to treat children in the following situations: • children who fail to grow because of a lack of growth hormone. • children who are short because of Turner syndrome (a rare genetic disorder affecting girls), confirmed by chromosome analysis (DNA testing). • children before puberty, who fail to grow because of longstanding kidney disease, (chronic renal insufficiency) up to the time when they receive a kidney transplant.
NutopinAq is used to treat adults in the following situation: • adult patients with growth hormone deficiency (replacement therapy).
The deficiency can have started in adulthood or childhood, and needs to be confirmed by testing before treatment.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is NutropinAq used?
NutropinAq treatment should be started and supervised by a doctor experienced in the management of patients with growth disorders.
The medicine is given once a day by subcutaneous injection (under the skin), using the injection pen specially designed for the NutropinAq cartridge.
The patient or caregiver can inject NutropinAq after training by a doctor or a nurse.
They should use a different injection site each day.
The doctor calculates individually the dose for each patient depending on the condition, and this may need to be adjusted over time, depending on response, age and body weight.
How does NutropinAq work?
Growth hormone is a substance secreted by a gland located at the base of the brain (pituitary gland).
It promotes growth during childhood and adolescence, and also acts on the way the body handles proteins, fat and carbohydrates.
The active ingredient in NutropinAq, somatropin, is identical to the human growth hormone.
It is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: the hormone is made by a bacterium that has received a gene (DNA) that makes it able to produce it.
NutropinAq replaces the natural hormone.

NutropinAq has been studied in children who had growth failure cause by lack of growth hormone (230), Turner syndrome (117), or kidney disease (195).
NutropinAq has also been studied in 171 adults with growth hormone deficiency.
The studies were controlled (NutropinAq was compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment) or with a group of untreated patients) except for the studies in children with a lack of growth hormone where there was no comparison with another group.
The main measures in the studies in children were height at the end of the study, and the speed of growth during the study.
The main measures in the adult study were lean body mass and decrease in total body fat.
What benefit has NutropinAq shown during the studies?
NutropinAq produced significantly better growth in children than would have been expected without treatment.
In adults, NutropinAq increased lean body mass and reduced total body fat.
What is the risk associated with NutropinAq?
The most common side effects in adults are myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain) and oedema (swelling), and these are seen in more than 1 in 10 patients.
In children, the frequency is lower (between 1 and 10 in 100 patients).
Other side effects seen at this lower frequency are reactions at the injection site, headache, hypertonia (muscle tension), hypothyroidism (under-activity of the thyroid gland), impaired glucose tolerance, asthenia (weakness) and development of antibodies (proteins that are produced in response to NutropinAq).
For the full list of all side effects reported with NutropinAq, see the Package Leaflet.
NutropinAq should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to somatropin or any of the other ingredients.
NutropinAq should not be used when the patient suffers from an active tumour, or a life-threatening illness.
NutropinAq should not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses (the state of the large bones when they have finished growing).
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
Somatropin may interfere with the body’ s use of insulin.
Blood sugar levels will need to be checked during treatment, and treatment with insulin may sometimes need to be adjusted or started.
Why has NutropinAq been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the effectiveness and safety of NutropinAq are generally comparable to that of other recombinant human growth hormone medicines.
They decided that NutropinAq’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in adults and children.
They recommended that NutropinAq be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about NutropinAq:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for NutropinAq to Ipsen Ltd on 16 February 2001.
The Authorisation was renewed on 16 February 2006.
