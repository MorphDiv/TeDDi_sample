Chart Type Line
Chart Wizard
you can choose a chart type.
Line
A line chart shows values as points on the y-axis.
The x-axis shows categories.
The y-values of each data series can be connected by a line.
Points only - this sub-type plots only points.
Points and lines - this sub-type plots points and connects points of the same data series by a line.
Lines only - this sub-type plots only lines.
3-D lines - this sub-type connects points of the same data series by a 3-D line.
Stack series
to arrange the points' y-values cumulative above each other.
The y-values no longer represent absolute values, except for the first column which is drawn at the bottom of the stacked points.
If you select
Percent
, the y-values are scaled as percentage of the category total.
Smooth lines
to draw curves through the points instead of straight lines.
Click
Properties
for a
dialogue box
to change the curves' properties.
