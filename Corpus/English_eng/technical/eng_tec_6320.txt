Fonts
This module is designed to allow you to easily select different fonts for different parts of the & kde; Desktop.
Here's a screenshot of the fonts settings module
The fonts settings module
The panel consists of different font groups to give you a lot of flexibility in configuring your fonts:
General: Used everywhere when the other font groups do not apply
Fixed width: Anywhere a non-proportional font is specified
Small: When small fonts are used
Toolbar: Font used in & kde; application toolbars
Menu: Font used in & kde; application menus
Window title: Font used in the window title
Taskbar: Font used in the taskbar panel applet
Desktop: Font used on the desktop to label icons
Each font has a corresponding Choose... button. By clicking on this button, a dialog box appears. You can use this dialog box to choose a new font, a font style and size. Then press Ok.
An example of the font you have chosen will be displayed in the space between the font group name and the Choose... button.
When you are done, simply click OK and all the necessary components of & kde; will be restarted so your changes can take affect immediately.
The Adjust All Fonts... button allows you to quickly set properties for all the fonts selected above. A font selection dialog similar to the standard one will appear, but you will notice checkboxes that allow you to change the Font, Font style or Size independently of each other. You can choose any one, two, or three of these options, and they will be applied to all the font groups.
Adjusting all fonts
The Adjust All Fonts... dialog
For example, if you have selected several different font faces above, and realize they are all a size too big (this often happens when you change screen resolution, for instance), you can apply a new font size to all the fonts, without affecting your customized font faces and styles.
Anti-aliasing text
Default anti-aliasing settings are those used system wide by your distribution and labelled System Settings. You can disable all anti-aliasing by choosing Disabled in the drop down box.
To use and set up anti-aliasing, simply choose Enabled from the box on the right of Use anti-aliasing:. The Configure... button will then get enabled and clicking on it will bring you a dialog to configure anti-aliasing.
Anti-aliasing properties
The anti-aliasing properties dialog
Placing a mark in the Exclude range: checkbox will allow you to specify which range of fonts will not be anti-aliased. This range is specified with the two combo boxes on the same line.
You can also choose the method that & kde; uses to create an anti-alias look to your fonts, and how strongly it should be applied. If you are not familiar with the individual methods, you should leave this option alone.
The ability to use anti-aliased fonts and icons requires that you have support in both X and the & Qt; toolkit, that you have suitable fonts installed, and that you are using the built-in font serving capabilities of the X server. If you still are having problems, please contact the appropriate & kde; mailing list, or check the FAQ.
Fonts DPI
Force fonts DPI: proposes you an alternate DPI other than your system one which is used as default when this setting is on Disabled. You can check what DPI your X server is set to by running xdpyinfo | grep resolution in a terminal window and then change the DPI using the drop down box. This will be applied to newly started applications only.
