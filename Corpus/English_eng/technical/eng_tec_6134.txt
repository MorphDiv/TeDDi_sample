This handbook describes how to use & kjots; 0.5, a small program which is handy for keeping miscellaneous notes.

Introduction
& kjots; is a small program that helps you to write down some short notes and organizes them for you.
Using & kjots;
& kjots; has two basic items used to organize your notes - Books and Pages.
You can create a number of books in & kjots;, and each book can contain a number of pages, where you actually type your notes. Each book should be given a name (so you can find what you are looking for), as should each page. Although you are n't forced to give a page a name, it is sensible to do so.
Using Books
To create a new book, use Ctrl; Shift; N or the menu entry File New Book, and you will be prompted to enter a name for the new book.
The name of the new book should now appear in the left part of the window. If you want the book to be in your Bookmarks, use Ctrl; B or the menu entry Bookmarks Add Bookmark. You can even organize your bookmarks in separate folders just as you probably do in & konqueror;.
If you want to have your books in a different order, you can simply drag and drop the book to the place where you want it to be.
Maybe you have noticed that there is no Save anywhere. This is not an error, & kjots; saves your books and pages automatically, so you will never lose that small note you write when you are on the phone and need to write down something in a hurry.
You can also export an entire book as a text file or as a html file, using File Export book.... You will be then prompted to enter a location for the file to be saved. The format of an example saved book is shown below:
############ # First page ############ Remember to go to the shops! ############# # Useful code ############# 10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD" 20 GOTO 10 ################ # The third page ################ This is the third page and is an example for KJots.
Remember that the dialog where you are prompted for a filename is a standard & kde; dialog. That means it is just as easy to store the file on your local hard disk as it is to save it on a web server, ftp server or USB memory stick. So you can export as html and save it on a webserver, this way you always have your notes available to you.
Using Pages
Pages are where you actually write whatever you are going to write. Once you have created a book, you can type text in the main text box.
To create additional pages, you can use Ctrl; N or the menu entry File New Page, which will create a new page. Similarly, the current page can be removed using File Delete Page.
If you need to insert the current date and time while you are writing a note, you can use Ctrl; Shift; I.
So that you can get to the page you want to see, pages can (and should) be given a name. This can be done in the way you are used to: double click the page you want to rename. You are then able to rename the page. Of course there is also a keyboard shortcut, you can use that at any time while writing a note. The shortcut is: Ctrl; M.
An other way of renaming the page is by selecting a part of your note and then press Ctrl; T, the selected text will instantly become the title of the page.
If you want fast access to a particular page, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to that page. Go to Settings Configure Shortcuts....
