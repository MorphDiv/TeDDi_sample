Basics
This section provides the fundamentals for working with $[officename] Basic.

sections.
Each Sub or Function can call other Subs and Functions.
If you take care to write generic code for a Sub or Function, you can probably re-use it in other programs.

Procedures and Functions
.
What is a Sub?
Sub
is the short form of
subroutine
, that is used to handle a certain task within a program.
Subs are used to split a task into individual procedures.
Splitting a program into procedures and sub-procedures enhances readability and reduces the error-proneness.
A Sub possibly takes some arguments as parameters but does not return any values back to the calling Sub or Function, for example:
DoSomethingWithTheValues(MyFirstValue, MySecondValue)
What is a Function?
function
is essentially a sub, which returns a value.
You may use a function at the right side of a variable declaration, or at other places where you normally use values, for example:
MySecondValue = myFunction(MyFirstValue)
Global and local variables
Global variables are valid for all subs and functions inside a module.
They are declared at the beginning of a module before the first Sub or Function starts.
Variables that you declare within a Sub or Function are valid only inside this Sub or Function.
These variables override global variables with the same name and local variables with the same name coming from superordinate Subs or Functions.
Structuring
Modules and Libraries
.
Subs and functions are always contained in modules.
You can define modules to be global or part of a document.
Multiple modules can be combined to a library.
