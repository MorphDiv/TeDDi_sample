The
GNOME Pilot Configuration Tool
To start the GNOME Pilot configuration tool, double-click on the Palm Pilot icon in the GNOME Control Center, or enter the command
There are three tabs in the
The GNOME Pilot Setup Assistant
The setup assistant will guide you through getting your PalmOS device ready to synchronize with your desktop system. At each step, enter the information requested and then click
The first step is to describe how your PDA is connected to your desktop. Check
The second step is device identification. If you have used synchronization software with the PDA before, it will already have a synchronization ID that your desktop can get from it. If you have not, you can set the owner name and ID on the PDA from your desktop.
Once you have completed this step, the GNOME Pilot software will contact your PalmOS device and get or set the owner name and other information.
The last step is to choose a name to use when referring to the configured PalmOS device, and a directory on your desktop system where you will store backups and other data.
Adding or Editing a PDA Entry: The "PDAs" Tab
The
Owner
This is the Owner name used on your PDA. If your pilot already has a name configured, you can get it from the pilot by clicking the
PDA ID
This is the ID number from your PDA. You can get this value from the handheld by clicking the
Name of PDA
This is the name by which your handheld will be identified. For example, you could call it MyPilot, or Palm5, or Roger.
Local folder
This is the directory where you will store information backed up from your handheld.
When editing or creating an entry, you will be asked for four pieces of information:
Adding or Editing an entry under the Device Settings Tab
The device settings tab controls the way your desktop system looks at your handheld as hardware. To add an entry to the list, click
For each entry you may choose:
Name
This is a name used to display the device in a list. You may choose almost any name you find convenient.
Type
Select the type of connection you have: Serial, USB, IrDA (infrared), Network or Bluetooth. Bluetooth connections require that pilot-link has been compiled with bluetooth support.
Timeout
Amount of time to try to connect to system, in seconds. If there is no communication between the desktop and the handheld for this many seconds, the system will give up trying.
Device
For USB, Serial and IrDA devices types, your handheld connects to the computer as a special file in the
You will need to make sure that your user account has read, write, and execute permissions on this device. To add those permissions, become root with the
Some devices such as
If you have not chosen the correct device, you will get an error message when you click
Speed
For USB, Serial and IrDA connections, select a number from the dropdown. The higher the number, the faster you are asking the system to transfer information. Normally, you should not change this; it is set, by default, for the fastest value that your connection type can provide. However, you may set it higher or lower if you wish. If you experience problems at high speeds, reducing the transfer speed sometimes helps.
Conduit Settings
A Conduit is a specialized program that channels data between your computer and your handheld. The
Each configured handheld may have its own set of conduits and conduit settings.
If a conduit is disabled, that type of data will be ignored when you HotSync. If a conduit is enabled, its data will be synchronized according to its settings. To enable or disable a conduit, select it and click the
To edit the settings, select a conduit and click the
Disabled
Do nothing.
Synchronize
Ensure that data is the same in both places, copying new data from the PDA to the desktop, and from the desktop to the PDA.
Copy to pilot
Copy all data from the desktop to the pilot. New data added on the pilot will not be copied back up to the desktop.
Copy from pilot
Copy all data from the pilot to the desktop. New data added on the desktop will not be copied down to the pilot.
Not all conduits will have all of actions. The list of possible actions is:
Other settings may be available as well, including Conduit Priority, which determines the order in which conduits will be used, and
The Pilot Applet
The GNOME Pilot panel applet sits in your panel until you are ready to synchronize your PalmOS device. If the pilot access daemon is running, the applet will appear in black and white. If it is not running, the applet will appear red and black. If the daemon is paused, the applet will be yellow and black.
Click once on the applet with the left mouse button to start the GNOME Pilot configuration tool.
Other actions for the applet are available in the right-click menu. They are:
Restore
If your PalmOS device has lost all data, select this item to restore it from a backup you made earlier.
Pause Daemon
Pause the GNOME Pilot daemon
Restart
Stop and restart the daemon.
Last Log
Display the results of the last synchronization performed.
Preferences
Click this item to select what happens when you click the applet, and whether to display notices in dialog boxes.
