EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
PANDEMRIX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Pandemrix?
Pandemrix is a vaccine that is given by injection.
It contains parts of influenza (flu) viruses that have been inactivated (killed).
Pandemrix contains a flu strain called ‘ A/ VietNam/ 1194/ 2005 NIBRG-14’ (H5N1).
What is Pandemrix used for?
Pandemrix is a vaccine for use in adults aged between 18 and 60 years to prevent ‘ pandemic’ flu.
It should only be used once a flu pandemic has been officially declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) or European Union (EU).
A flu pandemic happens when a new type (strain) of flu virus appears that can spread easily from person to person because people have no immunity (protection) against it.
A pandemic can affect most countries and regions around the world.
Pandemrix would be given according to official recommendations.
The vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Pandemrix used?
Pandemrix is given by injection into the upper arm muscle in two doses, at least three weeks apart.
How does Pandemrix work?
Pandemrix is a ‘ mock-up’ vaccine.
This is a special type of vaccine that is designed to help with the management of a pandemic.
Before a pandemic starts, nobody knows which strain of flu virus will be involved, so pharmaceutical companies cannot prepare the correct vaccine in advance.
Instead, they can prepare a vaccine that contains a strain of flu virus specifically chosen because nobody has been exposed to it, and to which nobody is immune.
They can then test this vaccine to see how people react to it, allowing them to predict how people will react when the flu strain causing the pandemic is included.
Vaccines work by ‘ teaching’ the immune system (the body’ s natural defences) how to defend itself against a disease.
Pandemrix contains small amounts of haemagglutinins (proteins from the surface) of a virus called H5N1.
The virus has first been inactivated (killed) so that it does not cause any disease.
If a pandemic starts, the virus strain in Pandemrix will be replaced by the strain causing the pandemic before the vaccine can be used.

When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the virus as ‘ foreign’ and makes antibodies against it.
The immune system will then be able to produce antibodies more quickly when it is exposed to the virus again.
This will help to protect against the disease caused by the virus.
Before use, the vaccine will be made up by mixing together a suspension that contains the virus particles with an emulsion.
The resulting ‘ emulsion’ will then be injected.
The emulsion contains an ‘ adjuvant ’ (a compound containing oil) to stimulate a better response.
How has Pandemrix been studied?
The effects of Pandemrix were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The main study of Pandemrix included 400 healthy adults and compared the ability of different doses of Pandemrix, with or without the adjuvant, to trigger the production of antibodies (‘ immunogenicity’).
The participants received two injections of Pandemrix containing one of four different doses of haemagglutinin.
The injections were given 21 days apart.
The main measures of effectiveness were the levels of antibodies against the flu virus in the blood at three different times: before vaccination, on the day of the second injection (day 21) and 21 days later (day 42).
What benefit has Pandemrix shown during the studies?
According to criteria laid down by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), a mock-up vaccine needs to bring about protective levels of antibodies in at least 70% of people for it to be considered suitable.
The study showed that Pandemrix containing 3.75 micrograms of haemagglutinin and the adjuvant produced an antibody response that met these criteria.
At 21 days after the second injection, 84% of the people receiving the vaccine had levels of antibodies that would protect them against H5N1.
What is the risk associated with Pandemrix?
The most common side effects with Pandemrix (occurred with 1 in 10 doses or more of the vaccine) are headache, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain), reactions at the site of the injection (hardening, swelling, pain and redness), fever and fatigue (tiredness).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Pandemrix, see the Package Leaflet.
Pandemrix should not be given to people who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to any of the components of the vaccine, or to any of the substances found at trace (very low) levels in the vaccine, such as eggs, chicken protein, ovalbumin (a protein in egg white), formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (an antibiotic) and sodium deoxycholate.
If a pandemic has started, however, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine to these patients, as long as facilities for resuscitation are available.
Why has Pandemrix been approved?
The CHMP decided that Pandemrix’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.
The Committee recommended that Pandemrix be given marketing authorisation.
Pandemrix has been authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’.
This means that because the strain of flu virus that may cause a pandemic is not known, it has not been possible to obtain full information about the future pandemic vaccine.
Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary.
What information is still awaited for Pandemrix?
If a pandemic is declared, the company that makes Pandemrix will include the flu strain responsible in the vaccine.
It will then collect information on the safety and effectiveness of the final pandemic vaccine, and submit this to the CHMP for evaluation.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Pandemrix?
If Pandemrix is used during a pandemic, the company that makes it will collect information on the safety of the vaccine while it is being used.
This will include information on its side effects and its safety in the elderly, pregnant women, patients with severe conditions, and people who have problems with their immune systems.
