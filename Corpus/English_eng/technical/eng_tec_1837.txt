Category
button to determine the formula element for which you would like to specify the spacing.
The appearance of the dialogue box depends on the selected category.
A preview window shows you which spacing is modified through the respective boxes.
Category
This button allows you to select the category for which you would like to change the spacing.
Spacing
Defines the spacing between variables and operators, between lines, and between root signs and radicals.
Spacing
Defines the spacing between variables and operators.
Line Spacing
Determines the spacing between lines.
Root Spacing
Determines the spacing between the root sign and radicals.
Indices
Defines the spacing for superscript and subscript indices.
Superscript
Determines the spacing for superscript indices.
Subscript
Determines the spacing for subscript indices.
Fractions
Defines the spacing between the fraction bar and the numerator or denominator.
Numerator
Determines the spacing between the fraction bar and the numerator.
Denominator
Determines the spacing between the fraction bar and the denominator.
Fraction Bars
Defines the excess length and line weight of the fraction bar.
Excess length
Determines the excess length of the fraction line.
Weight
Determines the weight of the fraction line.
Limits
Defines the spacing between the sum symbol and the limit conditions.
Upper limit
Determines the spacing between the sum symbol and the upper limit.
Lower limit
Determines the spacing between the sum symbol and the lower limit.
Brackets
Defines the spacing between brackets and the content.
Excess size (left/right)
Determines the vertical distance between the upper edge of the contents and the upper end of the brackets.
Spacing
Determines the horizontal distance between the contents and the upper end of the brackets.
Scale all brackets
Scales all types of brackets.
If you then enter
( a over b)
in the
Commands
window, the brackets will surround the whole height of the argument.
You normally achieve this effect by entering
left ( a over b right )
.
Excess size
Adjusts the percentage excess size.
At 0 percent the brackets are set so that they surround the argument at the same height.
The higher the entered value is, the larger the vertical gap between the contents of the brackets and the external border of the brackets.
The field can only be used in combination with
Scale all brackets
.
Matrices
Defines the relative spacing for the elements in a matrix.
Line spacing
Determines the spacing between matrix elements in a row.
Column spacing
Determines the spacing between matrix elements in a column.
Symbols
Defines the spacing of symbols in relation to variables
Primary height
Defines the height of the symbols in relation to the baseline.
Minimum spacing
Determines the minimum distance between a symbol and variable.
Operators
Defines the spacing between operators and variables or numbers.
Excess size
Determines the height from the variable to the operator's upper edge.
Spacing
Determines the horizontal distance between operators and variables.
Borders
Adds a border to your formula.
This option is particularly useful if you want to integrate the formula into a text file in $[officename] Writer.
When making settings, be sure that you do not use 0 as a size, since this creates viewing problems for text that surrounds the insertion point.
Left
The left border is positioned between the formula and background.
Right
The right border is positioned between the formula and background.
Top
The top border is positioned between the formula and background.
Bottom
The bottom border is positioned between the formula and background.
Default
Saves your changes as your default settings for all new formulae.
A security response will appear before saving these changes.
