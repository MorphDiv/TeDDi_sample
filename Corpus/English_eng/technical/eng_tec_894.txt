View - Toolbars - Drawing

toolbar, if it is not already open.
Drawing objects can be subsequently edited and modified.
Drawing objects created in this way are vector graphics, which you can scale freely without any loss of quality.
To create a rectangle, click the rectangle icon and move your cursor to the place in the document where you want one corner of the rectangle to be.
Press the mouse button and hold it down while dragging to the opposite corner of the rectangle.
When you release the mouse button, the rectangle is inserted in the document.
It is selected, and you can edit its properties through the context menu.
To draw multiple objects of the same type, double-click the icon.

With some window managers, you may need to hold down also the meta key.
Holding down the Shift key while dragging restricts the created object.
For example, instead of a rectangle you get a square, instead of an ellipse you get a circle.
When you drag a handle of an existing object with Shift held down, the aspect ratio of the object is retained.
To scale the objects, first select them by clicking on them with the selection tool.
You then see eight handles around the object.
When you drag one of the four corner handles, the opposite corner remains fixed while the other three corners move.
When you drag one of the side handles, the opposite side remains fixed.

Then press an arrow key.
