openlog() opens a connection to the system logger for a program.
The string ident is added to each message.
Values for option and facility are given below.
The option argument is used to indicate what logging options will be used when generating a log message.
The facility The facility argument is used to specify what type of program is logging the message.
This allows you to specify (in your machine's syslog configuration) how messages coming from different facilities will be handled.
The use of openlog() is optional.
It will automatically be called by syslog() if necessary, in which case ident will default to FALSE.
