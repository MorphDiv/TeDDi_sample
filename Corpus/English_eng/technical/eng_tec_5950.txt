The window manager
The default window manager provided by & kde; is the K Window Manager (kwin;). Please read The K Window Manager Handbook (which should be accessible from the kde; Help Center) for usage information.
Are there keyboard shortcuts for & kwin; operations?
Yes. Please refer to "The K Window Manager Handbook" for the list of shortcuts available.
Can I define my own set of keyboard shortcuts?
Yes. Launch the kde; Control Center and select Regional & Accessibility Keyboard Shortcuts to configure window manager bindings like maximizing windows, & etc;.
When I "iconify" a window, it disappears. Where does it go?
With many & X-Window; & GUI; s, the minimize button (a little dot) will erase the window that the program is running in and create, instead, an icon on the desktop. & kde; does not do this. Instead, when a window is iconified it is simply hidden (but the program is still running).
There are a few ways to access disappeared windows:
If you are running the taskbar part of & kicker;, you can choose to have a list of tasks displayed on your desktop. Iconified tasks will have their names displayed in gray.
If you click the & MMB; on the root window (ie;, the background of the desktop), & kwin; will give you a list of all available tasks.
How do I maximize windows only vertically or horizontally?
Provided your window is not already maximized, clicking on the maximize button with the & LMB; /MMB; /RMB; will maximize fully/ vertically/ horizontally respectively.
What is shading a window?
By shading a window we mean rolling up the window leaving just the title bar visible. You can do this by double clicking on the window title bar.
How can I start an application with special window options, like maximized/ minimized/ to stay on top?
Use the kstart command. As an example, to open & kcalc; with the Stay on Top option, use:
% kstart --ontop kcalc
For maximized windows, use the --maximize option, for minimized windows, use --iconify. You can see a full list of kstart options with kstart --help-all.
If you're using kstart to start applications at & kde; startup, you should use the --window option. See the & kde; User Guide, section Advanced Window Management for more information about this feature.
