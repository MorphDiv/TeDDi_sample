Set the maximum for the result (if you want)
0 means the result will not be limited
You can set the maximum you want for the result. For example, a child aged 6 will start learning additions up to a result equal to 5 then 6 then 7 and so on. Setting this value to N will ensure the random operation will not have a result bigger than N. Setting this value to 0 will set no limit.
