You can only link frames if:
The target frame is empty.
The target frame is not linked to another frame.
The source and the target frames are in the same section.
For example, you cannot link a header frame to a footer frame.
The source frame does not have a next link.
The target or the source frame are not contained in each other.
When you select a linked frame, a line is displayed that connects the linked frames.
The AutoSize feature is available only for the last frame in a chain of linked frames.
