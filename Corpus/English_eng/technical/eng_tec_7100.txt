It features different game types like logic puzzles, mental calculation games, memory trainers and verbal analogies, designed to test different cognitive skills.

There have been recent discussions in the scientific community regarding whether brain training software improves cognitive performance. Most of the studies show that there is little or no improvement, but that doesn't mean you can't have a good time playing games like
How the player scores are calculated.
Game score and timings
If you answer a puzzle incorrectly, you will not get any score for it.
If you answer a puzzle correctly, you will get a score which depends on the time taken to resolve the problem and whether you used the tip during the game.
The following table summarizes the different game durations (in seconds) based on the difficulty level.

Verbal analogies
With the expected time for the chosen difficulty level and the time you take to complete the game, the following logic is applied:
If you take less than the time expected to complete the game, you score 10 points.
If you take more than the time expected to complete the game, you score 8 points.
If you take more than 2x the time expected to complete the game, you score 7 points.
If you take more than 3x the time expected to complete the game, you score 6 points.
If you use a tip, you score only the 80% of the original score.
Computing the totals

This means that when playing at medium difficulty level, to get a score of 100 points you need to score 10 points on at least 20 games of every game type played.
This may sound challenging, but it allows players to compare game scores from different sessions (in the player's game history) and allows better tracking of the progression of the player through all of the games played.
