Translation
Translating the user interface
If & kplayer; is not yet translated into your language and you want to make a translation, first find out what is the abbreviated code for your language by looking in the list of & kde; languages for your language code. For example the code for Portuguese is pt.
Next look at the list of existing & kplayer; translations to see if the file for your translation already exists. For example an Italian translation file it. po does exist, which means that someone already did at least part of the job. If so, download the latest version of the file and see if it needs some work.
If the file does not exist, download the latest kplayer. pot file and rename it with your language code and the. po extension. For example a Portuguese translation file will be called pt. po. If there already is a translation to a language that is close to yours, you can use that as a template instead.
kbabel; is a great & kde; program for translating. po files. Once you are done, send your translation to kiriuja.
Translating the user manual
Go to the kplayer; documentation directory and look for a subdirectory for your language code. If you find it, get the latest versions of all. po files from it and see if they have any untranslated text.
If the subdirectory for your language code does not exist, go to the templates subdirectory, download the latest versions of all. pot files from it, open each one of them in & kbabel;, translate and save with the. po extension.
When you are done translating all the files, send the finished translation to kiriuja.
Do not translate the. docbook files directly. Such translation is very difficult to maintain, and therefore will not be accepted.
Translating the. desktop files
Action names and comments in the. desktop files that come with & kplayer; are also translatable. The translations go into the files themselves. Open the files with a UTF capable text editor and translate the entries using the same format as the translations to other languages in the same files and replacing the language code with the code for your language. Keep in mind that the action names are verbs, for example Queue means put in the queue. See the section of this manual describing the Library menu for details about those actions.
