& kde; applications
& kppp;
Many & kde; users report problems using & kppp;. But before you complain about & kppp;, make sure you have already checked the following:
Can you dialup to your ISP without using & kppp;? If you cannot, then perhaps & kppp; is not the culprit after all.
Have you gone through the & kppp; documentation at least three times and followed its instructions and trouble-shooting suggestions?
The & kppp; documentation can be accessed through the kde; Help Center. Last, but not least, the & kppp; homepage is at http: / /ktown. kde. org/ ~kppp/.
Now, if you still encounter problems, here's what might help you solve them:
How do I change the & MTU; setting in & kppp;?
Open up the & kppp; dialog box and select Setup. Choose an existing account and click Edit, or New to create a new dialup account. Select the Dial tab and click Arguments. Type what you want to change in the Argument textbox (eg; mtu 296) and click Add. When you are satisfied, click Close.
To check whether the options took, do one of the following:
In a terminal window, run / sbin/ ifconfig ppp0 and look at the reported & MTU; in the output. It should match your request.
Add debug and kdebug (each on a separate line) to your / etc/ ppp/ options file and restart your & PPP; session. You will find debugging messages in / var/ log/ messages, including & MRU; and & MTU; settings.
If you want, the & MRU; and & MTU; settings can be added to the options file, one complete setting per line, no quotes or dashes.
& kppp; connects at a slower speed than normal.
The following might do the trick:
Try executing setserial spd_hi.
The default & MTU; value is 1500, which maybe too large for a dialup connection. Try changing it to a smaller value like 296 or 576.
Check in your $HOME /. kde/ share/ config for the kppprc. Ensure the correct modem speed is actually defined there.
& konsole;
How do I page-up or page-down?
Use & Shift; Page Up and Shift; Pg Dn.
How do I perform a simple copy from & konsole; to anything else?
When I do a ls, first I select with the mouse the desired text, press Ctrl; C, then I make the target application active, point the mouse to the relevant part and press Ctrl; V. Alternatively, highlight the text by dragging with the & LMB; down and paste by clicking with the & MMB; (or both buttons if you are using a 2 button mouse with 3 button emulation).
Why ca n't & konsole; find the 9x15 and the 2 console bitmap fonts installed with & kde;?
FontConfig must find the three fonts installed in: $KDEDIR / share/ fonts. If the & kde; install does not install these fonts in a directory that already exists (eg; / usr/ share/ fonts) then you must add this directory to the configuration file / etc/ fonts/ local. conf. This should be the first line after lt; fontconfiggt;. For example: & lt; fontconfiggt; & lt; dirgt; /usr/ kde3/ share/ fontslt; /dirgt; & lt; /fontconfiggt; After adding the directory, run (as root): fc-cache -v and check that it found the directory.
