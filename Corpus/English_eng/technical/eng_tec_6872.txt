The CGI KIO slave lets you execute local CGI programs without the need to run a web server.
In this system settings module you can configure the paths that are searched for CGI scripts.
Paths to CGI scripts are displayed in the list box at the bottom of this dialog.
Use the buttons below the list box to add or remove paths from the search.
