ACLs
Abbreviation for A ccess C ontrol L ists; ACLs are used to check for the access by a given (authenticated) user. A first rough support for ACLs for printing is available from & CUPS;; this will be refined in future versions.
Authentication
AppSocket Protocol
AppSocket is a protocol for the transfer of print data, also frequently called "Direct TCP/ IP Printing". & Hewlett-Packard; have taken AppSocket, added a few minor extensions around it and been very successful in renaming and marketing it under the brand "HP; JetDirect"...
HP; JetDirect Protocol Direct TCP/ IP Printing
APSfilter
APSfilter is used mainly in the context of "classical" & UNIX; printing (BSD-style LPD). It is a sophisticated shell script, disguised as an "all-in-one" filtering program. In reality, APSfilter calls "real filters" to do the jobs needed. It sends printjobs automatically through these other filters, based on an initial file-type analysis of the printfile. It is written and maintained by Andreas Klemm. It is similar to Magicfilter and mostly uses Ghostscript for file conversions. Some Linux Distributions (like & SuSE;) use APSfilter, others Magicfilter (like & RedHat;), some have both for preference selection (like *BSD). & CUPS; has no need for APSfilter, as it runs its own file type recognition (based on & MIME; types) and applies its own filtering logic.

Authentication
Proving the identity of a certain person (maybe via username/ password or by means of a certificate) is often called authentication. Once you are authenticated, you may or may not get access to a requested resource, possibly based on ACLs.

Bi-directional communication
In the context of printing, a server or a host may receive additional information sent back from the printer (status messages & etc;), either upon a query or unrequested. AppSocket (= & HP; JetDirect), & CUPS; and IPP support bi-directional communication, LPR/ LPD and BSD-style printing do not...

BSD-style Printing
Generic term for different variants of the traditional & UNIX; printing method. Its first version appeared in the early 70s on BSD & UNIX; and was formally described in RFC 1179 only as late as 1990. At the time when BSD "remote" printing was first designed, printers were serially or otherwise directly connected devices to a host (with the Internet hardly consisting of more than 100 nodes!); printers used hole-punched, continuous paper, fed through by a tractor mechanism, with simple rows of ASCII text mechanically hammered on to the medium, drawn from a cardboard box beneath the table. It came out like a zig-zag folded paper "snake". Remote printing consisted of a neighboring host in the next room sending a file asking for printout. How technology has changed! Printers generally use cut-sheet media, they have built-in intelligence to compute the raster images of pages after pages that are sent to them using one of the powerful page description languages (PDL). Many are network nodes in their own right, with CPU, RAM, a hard disk and their own Operation System, and are hooked to a net with potentially millions of users... It is a vast proof of the flexible & UNIX; concept for doing things, that it made "Line Printing" reliably work even under these modern conditions. But time has finally come now to go for something new -- the IPP.
IPP CUPS; LPR/ LPD printing
CUPS;
Abbreviation for C ommon U NIX P rinting S ystem; & CUPS; is the most modern & UNIX; and Linux printing system, also providing cross-platform print services to & Microsoft; & Windows; and Apple & MacOS; clients. Based on IPP, it does away with all the pitfalls of old-style BSD printing, providing authentication, encryption and ACLs, plus many more features. At the same time it is backward-compatible enough to serve all legacy clients that are not yet up to IPP, via LPR/ LPD (BSD-style). & CUPS; is able to control any & PostScript; printer by utilizing the vendor-supplied PPD (PostScript Printer Description file), targeted originally for & Microsoft; Windows NT printing only. & kde; Printing is most powerful if based on & CUPS;.

& CUPS; -O-Matic
& CUPS; -O-Matic was the first "Third Party" plugin for the & CUPS; printing software. It is available on the Linuxprinting. org website to provide an online PPD-generating service. Together with the companion cupsomatic Perl-Script, that needs to be installed as an additional & CUPS; backend, it redirects output from the native pstops filter into a chain of suitable Ghostscript filters. Upon completion, it passes the resulting data back to a & CUPS; "backend" for sending to the printer. In this way, & CUPS; -O-Matic enables support for any printer known to have worked previously in a "classical" Ghostscript environment. If no native & CUPS; support for that printer is in sight... & CUPS; -O-Matic is now replaced by the more capable PPD-O-Matic.
cupsomatic PPD-O-Matic Foomatic
cupsomatic
The Perl script cupsomatic (plus a working Perl installation on your system) is needed to make any & CUPS; -O-Matic (or PPD-O-Matic) generated PPD work with & CUPS;. It was written by Grant Taylor, author of the Linux Printing HOWTO and Maintainer of the printer database at the Linuxprinting. org website.
CUPS; -O-Matic Foomatic cupsomatic
Daemon
Abbreviation for D isk a nd e xecution mon itor; Daemons are present on all & UNIX; systems to perform tasks independent of user intervention. Readers more familiar with & Microsoft; & Windows; might want to compare daemons and the tasks they are responsible with "services". One example of a daemon present on most legacy & UNIX; systems is the LPD (Line Printer Daemon); & CUPS; is widely seen as the successor to LPD in the & UNIX; world and it also operates through a daemon.
SPOOLing
Database, Linuxprinting. org
Already years ago, when Linux printing was still really difficult (only command line printing was known to most Linux users, no device specific print options were available for doing the jobs), Grant Taylor, author of the "Linux Printing HOWTO", collected most of the available information about printers, drivers and filters in his database. With the emerging & CUPS; concept, extending the use of PPDs even to non-PostScript printers, he realized the potential of this database: if one puts the different datablobs (with content that could be described along the lines "Which device prints with which Ghostscript or other filter?", "How well?", and "What command line switches are available?") into PPD-compatible files, he could have all the power of & CUPS; on top of the traditional printer "drivers". This has now developed into a broader concept, known as "Foomatic". Foomatic extends the capabilities of spoolers other than & CUPS; (LPR/ LPD, LPRng, PDQ, PPR) to a certain degree ("stealing" some concepts from & CUPS;). The Linuxprinting Database is not a Linux-only stop -- people running other & UNIX; based OSes (like *BSD or & MacOS; X) will also find valuable information and software there.
Foomatic Linuxprinting database
Direct TCP/ IP Printing
This is a method that often uses TCP/ IP port 9100 to connect to the printer. It works with many modern network printers and has a few advantages over LPR/ LPD, as it is faster and provides some "backchannel feedback data" from the printer to the host sending the job.
AppSocket Protocol HP; JetDirect Protocol
Drivers, Printer Drivers
The term "printer drivers", used in the same sense as on the & Microsoft; & Windows; platform, is not entirely applicable to a Linux or & UNIX; platform. A "driver" functionality is supplied on & UNIX; by different modular components working together. At the core of the printer drivers are "filters". Filters convert print files from a given input format to another format that is acceptable to the target printer. In many cases filters may be connected to a whole filter "chain", where only the result of the last conversion is sent to the printer. The actual transfer of the print data to the device is performed by a "backend".

ESP finance themselves by selling a commercial version of & CUPS;, called ESP PrintPro, that includes some professional enhancements.

Encryption
Encryption of confidential data is an all-important issue if you transfer it over the Internet or even within intranets. Printing via traditional protocols is not encrypted at all -- it is very easy to tap and eavesdrop & eg; into & PostScript; or PCL data transfered over the wire. Therefore, in the design of IPP, provision was made for the easy plugin of encryption mechanisms (which can be provided by the same means as the encryption standards for HTTP traffic: SSL and TLS).

Epson
Epson inkjets are among the best supported models by Free software drivers, as the company was not necessarily as secretive about their devices and handed technical specification documents to developers. The excellent print quality achieved by Gimp-Print on the Stylus series of printers can be attributed to this openness. They have also contracted Easy Software Products to maintain an enhanced version of Ghostscript ("ESP GhostScript") for improved support of their printer portfolio.

Escape Sequences
The first ever printers printed ASCII data only. To initiate a new line, or eject a page, they included special command sequences, often carrying a leading [ESC]-character. & HP; evolved this concept through its series of PCL language editions until today, having now developed a full-blown Page Description Language (PDL) from these humble beginnings.

This professional enhancement to & CUPS; (the "Common & UNIX; Printing System") is sold by the developers of & CUPS; complete with more than 2,300 printer drivers for several commercial & UNIX; platforms. ESP PrintPro is supposed to work "out of the box" with little or no configuration for users or admins. ESP also sell support contracts for & CUPS; and PrintPro. These sales help to feed the programmers who develop the Free version of & CUPS;.

Filter
Filters, in general, are programs that take some input data, work on it and pass it on as their output data. Filters may or may not change the data. Filters in the context of printing, are programs that convert a given file (destined for printing, but not suitable in the format it is presently) into a printable format. Sometimes whole "filter chains" have to be constructed to achieve the goal, piping the output of one filter as the input to the next.
Ghostscript RIP
Foomatic
Foomatic started out as the wrapper name for a set of different tools available from Linuxprinting. org These tools aimed to make the usage of traditional Ghostscript and other print filters easier for users and extend the filters' capabilities by adding more command line switches or explain the driver's execution data. Foomatic's different incarnations are & CUPS; -O-Matic, PPD-O-Matic, PDQ-O-Matic, LPD-O-Matic, PPR-O-Matic, MF-O-Matic and Direct-O-Matic. All of these allow the generation of appropriate printer configuration files online, by simply selection the suitable model and suggested (or alternate) driver for that machine. More recently, Foomatic gravitated towards becoming a "meta-spooling" system, that allows configuration of the underlying print subsystem through a unified set of commands (however, this is much more complicated than KDEPrint's & GUI; interface, which performs a similar task with regards to different print subsystems).

Ghostscript
Ghostscript is a & PostScript; Raster Image Processor (RIP) in software, originally developed by L. Peter Deutsch. There is always a GPL version of Ghostscript available for free usage and distribution (mostly 1 year old) while the current version is commercially sold under another license. Ghostscript is widely used inside the Linux and & UNIX; world for transforming & PostScript; into raster data suitable for sending to non-PostScript; devices.

kprinter
kprinter is the new powerful print utility that is natively used by all & kde; applications. Contrary to some common misconceptions, kprinter is not a & CUPS; -only tool, but supports different print subsystems. You can even switch to a different print subsystem "on the fly", in between two jobs, without re-configuration. Of course, due to the powerful features of & CUPS;, kprinter is best suited for use with a & CUPS; frontend. kprinter is the successor to "qtcups", which is no longer being actively maintained. It has inherited all the best features of qtcups and added several new ones. MOST IMPORTANT: you can use kprinter with all its features in all non-kde; applications that allow a customized print command, like gv, Acrobat Reader, Netscape, Mozilla, Galeon, StarOffice, OpenOffice and all GNOME programs. kprinter can act as a "standalone" utility, started from an X-Terminal or a "Mini-CLI" to print many different files, from different folders, with different formats, in one job and simultaneously, without the need to first open the files in the applications! (File formats supported this way are & PostScript;, PDF, International and ASCII Text, as well as many different popular graphic formats, such as PNG, TIFF, JPEG, PNM, Sun RASTER, & etc;)

& MIME; -Types
Abbreviation for M ultipurpose (or Multimedia) I nternet M ail E xtensions; & MIME; -Types were first used to allow the transport of binary data (like mail attachments containing graphics) over mail connections that were normally only transmitting ASCII characters: the data had to be encoded into an ASCII representation. Later this concept was extended to describe a data format in a platform independent, but at the same time non-ambiguous, way. From & Windows; everybody knows the. doc extensions for & Microsoft; Word files. This is handled ambiguously on the & Windows; platform:. doc extensions are also used for simple text files or for Adobe Framemaker files. And if a real Word file is renamed with a different extension, it can no longer be opened by the program. & MIME; typed files carry a recognition string with them, describing their file format based on main_category/ sub_category. Inside IPP, print files are also described using the & MIME; type scheme. & MIME; types are registered with the IANA (Internet Assigning Numbers Association) to keep them unambiguous. & CUPS; has some & MIME; types of its own registered, like application/ vnd. cups-raster (for the & CUPS; -internal raster image format).

PPD
Abbreviation for P ostScript P rinter D escription; PPDs are ASCII files storing all information about the special capabilities of a printer, plus definitions of the (PostScript- or PJL-) commands to call on a certain capability (like print duplexing). As the explanation of the acronym reveals, PPDs were originally only used for & PostScript; printers. & CUPS; has extended the PPD concept to all types of printers. PPDs for & PostScript; printers are provided by the printer vendors. They can be used with & CUPS; and KDEPrint to have access to the full features of any & PostScript; printer. The KDEPrint Team recommends using a PPD originally intended for use with & Microsoft; Windows NT. PPDs for non-PostScript printers need a companion "filter" to process the & PostScript; print files into a format digestible for the non-PostScript target device. Those PPD/ filter combos are not (yet) available from the vendors. After the initiative by the & CUPS; developers to utilize PPDs, the Free Software community was creative enough to quickly come up with support for most of the currently used printer models, through PPDs and classical Ghostscript filters. But note: the printout quality varies from "hi-quality photographic output" (using Gimp-Print with most Epson inkjets) to "hardly readable" (using Foomatic-enabled Ghostscript filters for models rated as "paperweight" in the Linuxprinting. org database).

PPD-O-Matic is a set of Perl scripts that run on the Linuxprinting. org web server and can be used online to generate PPDs for any printer that is known to print with Ghostscript. These PPDs can be hooked up to & CUPS; /KDEPrint, as well as used inside PPD-aware applications like StarOffice to determine all different parameters of your printjobs. It is now recommended, in most cases, to use "PPD-O-Matic" instead of the older & CUPS; -O-Matic. To generate a PPD, go to the printer database, select your printer model, follow the link to show the available Ghostscript filters for that printer, select one, click "generate" and finally save the file to your local system. Be sure to read the instructions. Make sure that your local system does indeed have Ghostscript and the filter, which you chose before generating the PPD, installed.

In BSD-style print systems, the "printcap" file holds the configuration information; the printing daemon reads this file to determine which printers are available, what filters are to be user for each, where the spooling folder is located, if there are banner pages to be used, and so on... Some applications also depend on read access to the printcap file, to obtain the names of available printers.

Raster Image
Every picture on a physical medium is composed of a pattern of discrete dots in different colors and (maybe) sizes. This is called a "raster image". This is as opposed to a "vector image" where the graphic is described in terms of continuous curves, shades, forms and filled areas, represented by mathematical formula. Vector images normally have a smaller file size and may be scaled in size without any loss of information and quality --- but they cannot be output directly, but always have to be "rendered" or "rasterized" first to the given resolution that the output device is capable of... The rasterization is done by a Raster Image Processor (RIP, often the Ghostscript software) or some other filtering instance.
Pixel Ghostscript PostScript; Filter RIP
RIP
Abbreviation for R aster I mage P rocess(or); if used in the context of printing, "RIP" means a hardware or software instance that converts & PostScript; (or other print formats that are represented in one of the non-Raster PDLs) into a raster image format in such a way that it is acceptable for the "marking engine" of the printer. & PostScript; printers contain their own PostScript-RIPs. A RIP may or may not be located inside a printer. For many & UNIX; systems, Ghostscript is the package that provides a "RIP in software", running on the host computer, and pre-digesting the & PostScript; or other data to become ready to be sent to the printing device (hence you may perceive a "grain of truth" in the slogan "Ghostscript turns your printer into a & PostScript; machine", which of course is not correct in the true sense of the meaning).

RLPR comes in handy for many laptop users who are working in frequently changing environments. This is because it may be installed concurrently with every other printing sub system, and allows a very flexible and quick way to install a printer for direct access via LPR/ LPD.
