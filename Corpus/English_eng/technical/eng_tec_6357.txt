System Notifications KDE allows for a great deal of control over how you will be notified when certain events occur. There are several choices as to how you are notified: As the application was originally designed. With a beep or other noise. Via a popup dialog box with additional information. By recording the event in a logfile without any additional visual or audible alert.
