These are the certificates you have selected for deletion:
These certificates will be deleted even though you did not explicitly select them (Why?):
Why do you want to delete more certificates than I selected? When you delete CA certificates (both root CAs and intermediate CAs), the certificates issued by them will also be deleted. This can be nicely seen in Kleopatra's hierarchical view mode: In this mode, if you delete a certificate that has children, those children will also be deleted. Think of CA certificates as folders containing other certificates: When you delete the folder, you delete its contents, too.

This option enables interval checking of certificate validity. You can also choose the checking interval (in hours). Note that validation is perfomed implicitly whenever significant files in ~/. gnupg change. This option therefore only affects external factors of certificate validity.
Check certificate validity every
hour
hours
If this option is selected, S/ MIME certificates are validated using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
Validate certificates using CRLs
If this option is selected, S/ MIME certificates are validated online using the Online Certificates Status Protocol (OCSP). Fill in the URL of the OCSP responder below.
Validate certificates online (OCSP)
Online Certificate Validation
OCSP responder URL:
Enter here the address of the server for online validation of certificates (OCSP responder). The URL is usually starting with http: / /.
OCSP responder signature:
Ignore service URL of certificates
By default GnuPG uses the file ~/. gnupg/ policies. txt to check if a certificate policy is allowed. If this option is selected, policies are not checked.
Do not check certificate policies
If this option is checked, Certificate Revocation Lists are never used to validate S/ MIME certificates.
Never consult a CRL
If this option is checked, missing issuer certificates are fetched when necessary (this applies to both validation methods, CRLs and OCSP).
Fetch missing issuer certificates
& HTTP Requests
Entirely disables the use of HTTP for S/ MIME.
Do not perform any HTTP requests
When looking for the location of a CRL, the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the HTTP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.
Ignore HTTP CRL distribution point of certificates
If this option is selected, the value of the HTTP proxy shown on the right (which comes from the environment variable http_proxy) will be used for any HTTP request.
Use system HTTP proxy:
Use this proxy for HTTP requests:
Enter here the location of your HTTP Proxy, which will be used for all HTTP requests relating to S/ MIME. The syntax is host: port, for instance myproxy. nowhere. com:3128.
& LDAP Requests
Entirely disables the use of LDAP for S/ MIME.
Do not perform any LDAP requests
When looking for the location of a CRL, the to-be-tested certificate usually contains what are known as "CRL Distribution Point" (DP) entries, which are URLs describing the way to access the URL. The first found DP entry is used. With this option all entries using the LDAP scheme are ignored when looking for a suitable DP.
Ignore LDAP CRL distribution point of certificates
Primary host for LDAP requests:
Entering a LDAP server here will make all LDAP requests go to that server first. More precisely, this setting overrides any specified host and port part in a LDAP URL and will also be used if host and port have been omitted from the URL. Other LDAP servers will be used only if the connection to the "proxy" failed. The syntax is "HOST" or "HOST: PORT". If PORT is omitted, port 389 (standard LDAP port) is used.

Step 2: Choose how to certify.
Choose which of your certificates to sign with:
Certify only for myself
Certify for everyone to see
Send certified certificate to server afterwards
I do not know
(unknown trust)
Choose this if you have no opinion about the trustworthyness of the certificate's owner. Certifications at this trust level are ignored when checking the validity of OpenPGP certificates.
I do NOT trust them
(never trust)
Choose this if you explicitly do not trust the certificate owner, e. g. because you have knowledge of him certifying without checking or without the certificate owner's consent. Certifications at this trust level are ignored when checking the validity of OpenPGP certificates.
I believe checks are casual
(marginal trust)
Choose this if you trust certifications are not done blindly, but not very accuratly, either. Certificates will only become valid with multiple certifications (typically three) at this trust level. This is usually a good choice.
I believe checks are very accurate
(full trust)
Choose this if you trust certifications are done very accurately. Certificates will become valid with just a single certification at this trust level, so assign this much trust with care.
This is my certificate
(ultimate trust)
Choose this if and only if this is your certificate. This is the default if the secret key is available, but if you imported this certificate, you might need to adjust the trust level yourself. Certificates will become valid with just a single certification at this trust level.
Step 2: How thoroughly have you checked that this certificate actually belongs to the person it claims it is from?
I have not checked at all
Describe semantics here...
I have checked casually
Choose this if you know the person, and have asked them whether this was their certificate, but you have not verified they are actually in possession of the secret certificate.
I have checked very thoroughly
Choose this if you have, for instance, checked the ID card of the person, and have verified that they are in possession of the secret key (e. g. by sending them encrypted mail and asking for it to be decrypted).

This is how the new User-ID will be stored in the certificate:
On this SmartCard, there is space for two certificates: A normal certificate A special certificate for making qualified signatures according to the German Signaturgesetz You need to set initial PINs for both of them.
Step 1: Set the initial PIN for the first certificate ("NKS"):

Step 2: Set the initial PIN for the qualified signature certificate ("SigG"):

Creating Key...
Your key is being created.
The process of creating a key requires large amounts of random numbers. To foster this process, you can use the entry field below to enter some gibberish. The text itself does not matter - only the inter-character timing. You can also move this window around with your mouse, or start some disk-intensive application.
Choose Certificate Format
Please choose which type of certificate you want to create.
Create a personal OpenPGP key pair
OpenPGP key pairs are created locally, and certified by your friends and acquaintances. There is no central certification authority; instead, every individual creates a personal Web of Trust by certifying other users' key pairs with their own certificate.
Create a personal X.509 key pair and certification request
X.509 key pairs are created locally, but certified centrally by a certification authority (CA). CAs can certify other CAs, creating a central, hierarchical chain of trust.

Gpg-Agent Connectivity
GpgME library too old
Either the GpgME library itself is too old, or the GpgME++ library was compiled against an older GpgME that did not support connecting to gpg-agent.
Upgrade to gpgme 1.2.0 or higher, and ensure that gpgme++ was compiled against it.
GpgME does not support gpg-agent
The GpgME library is new enough to support gpg-agent, but does not seem to do so in this installation. The error returned was: %1.
not reachable
Could not connect to GpgAgent: %1
Check that gpg-agent is running and that the GPG_AGENT_INFO variable is set and up-to-date.
unexpected error
Unexpected error while asking gpg-agent for its version. The error returned was: %1.
UiServer Connectivity
Could not connect to UiServer: %1
Check that your firewall is not set to block local connections (allow connections to localhost or 127.0.0.1).

Kleopatra tried to send a mail via your default mail client. Some mail clients are known not to support attachments when invoked this way. If your mail client does not have an attachment, then drag the Kleopatra icon and drop it on the message compose window of your mail client. If that does not work, either, save the request to a file, and then attach that.
Sending Mail
This operation will delete the certification request. Please make sure that you have sent or saved it before proceeding.
