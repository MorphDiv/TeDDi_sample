Description
plasmaengineexplorer is a graphical tool allowing developers to test Plasma data engines without writing a Plasma applet.
If no options are given, it will start without any data engine selected. The required data engine can be selected from a drop-down list.
Only installed data engines will be found. kbuildsycoca4 may need to be run for newly-installed data engines to be found.
Options
--height pixels
Sets the height of the window, in pixels.
--width pixels
Sets the width of the window, in pixels.
-x pixels
Sets the x (horizontal) co-ordinate of the top left corner of the window, in pixels.
-y pixels
Sets the y (vertical) co-ordinate of the top left corner of the window, in pixels.
--engine name
Start plasmaengineexplorer with the given data engine selected. name is the internal name of the data engine given by the X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name key of the desktop file.
--source name
Only valid in conjunction with --engine. Requests a specific source from the data engine when plasmaengineexplorer is started.
--interval time
Sets the default update interval for requested sources to time milliseconds. If not set, the source will update on demand (for some sources, this will be when new data is available).
If --source is specified, this is the update interval that will be used when requesting that source.
