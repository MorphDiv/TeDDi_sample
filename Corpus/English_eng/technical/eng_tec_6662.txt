Introduction
Manual
Cheese uses your webcam to take photos and videos, applies fancy special effects and lets you share the fun with others.
Usage
The main screen of Cheese supports two different layouts at the moment. The default looks like the screenshot below, it has the preview image centered and the thumbnail slideshow below.
Cheese screenshot
Especially for Cheese-users with small displays, like the ones in netbooks, we have designed another view. It is more horizontally aligned, in order to fit better on small widescreen displays. The wide-view is shown in the screenshot below.

Cheese uses the photo mode by defaults, but you can change this to use the video or burst mode if desired.

If your video appears to be jerky or has a low frame rate (only updating the picture every few seconds), it does not mean that the recording has a similar frame rate. In many cases, the recorded file will have a better frame rate.
Taking a series of pictures in burst mode
To take more than one picture over some time you can use the burst mode. Burst mode can be set up in the preferences dialog where you can also set the amount of pictures you want to take and the delay in seconds between them. You can find more information about that in

Setting up Cheese
The preferences dialog
The preferences dialog allows you to set up some webcam specific parameters and parameters specific to the burst mode. If you have more than one webcam or video device attached to your system, the preferences dialog allows you to choose which one you would like to use for Cheese and what resolution the image should have. Use the sliders to play around with the brightness, contrast, saturation and hue values to find the best for your webcam.
Cheese preferences screenshot
The parameters for the burst mode can be set in the preferences dialog as well. You only have to adjust the values for the number of photos you wish to take and the delay in seconds between each picture taken.
GConf settings
It's possible to define where Cheese stores the captured media (photos and videos). These settings are stored in GConf. You can change the settings with the

Where does
Cheese stores your pictures in a folder called Webcam inside the XDG-Directory set for Pictures (in most distributions its ~/Pictures/Webcam). The same applies for Videos: ~/Videos/Webcam. XDG is a standard to declare default folders in your system. You can find more information about XDG
If the XDG-Path is not set on your System, cheese has a fallback solution: it will store both your pictures and videos in ~/.gnome2/cheese/media. This is the default directory for your media if you have an older version of

"No Camera Found" Error Message
"When I launch Cheese, I get the message 'No Camera Found' but I have my webcam plugged into my computer".
There are many situations that can cause this, and the exact problem that is causing it needs to be isolated. If possible, try each of the following to try and get your webcam working:
Plug your webcam into another computer. If it works there, then it is a problem with the connection to your computer, or the operating system if it was a different one on the other computer. Check the ports on your computer (try another one) and consult support for your particular operating system.
See if your camera is being detected by your computer. On Linux, open up the terminal or console and type "dmesg" before you plug in your webcam. Notice the most recent entries, and then plug in your webcam. Type "dmesg" again and see if the most recent entries differ. If the message mentions a USB device being detected, and your webcam is the only USB device that has been changed, then your computer is detecting your webcam fine. If not, then test to see if the webcam is working on another computer. This may only work with USB webcams.
As Cheese uses the gstreamer backend, it is most likely because gstreamer is not detecting the webcam (or gstreamer has become corrupt). Please contact support for the particular operating system that you are running with as many details as possible. For Ubuntu, please use the
Which cameras are supported?
Cheese uses gstreamer for video grabbing. So in principle Cheese supports any camera that works with GStreamer. That should be any camera which supports video4linux or video4linux2.
