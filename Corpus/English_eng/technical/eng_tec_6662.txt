Hint
Colors
Now the parts of the inside ring and outside ring have the same size, and we can add the fractions! This is called finding the main denominator. The main denominator divides the rings into equal parts.
There is a smaller main denominator. Can you find it?
You have just multiplied the first fraction by %1. Our main goal is to make all parts be the same size. Try multiplying the first fraction by %2 and the second fraction by %3.
You have just multiplied the second fraction by %1. Our main goal is to make all parts be the same size. Try multiplying the first fraction by %2 and the second fraction by %3.
The outside ring represents the left fraction. %1 The inside ring represents the right fraction. %2 The'Multiply 'spinboxes multiplies each fraction. Try to change one of the spinbox values!
