To share files via the web, you need to be running an'applet 'in your KDE panel. This'applet' is a small program which provides file sharing capabilities.
Start Applet

Share this directory on the & Web
kB/ s
Setting this option makes all files in this directory and any subdirectories available for reading to anyone who wishes to view them. To view your files, a web browser or similar program may be used. Warning Before sharing a directory, you should be sure that it does not contain sensitive information, such as passwords, company secrets, your address book, etc. Note that you cannot share your home directory (%1).
Applet status: starting...
Applet status: failed to start
Applet status: running
Before you share a directory, be absolutely certain that it does not contain sensitive information. Sharing a directory makes all information in that directory and all subdirectories available to anyone who wishes to read it. If you have a system administrator, please ask for permission before sharing a directory in this way.
Warning - Sharing Sensitive Information?
You cannot run KPF as root.
Running as root exposes the whole system to external attackers.
Running as root.

Here you may select files to use instead of the default error messages passed to a client. The files may contain anything you wish, but by convention you should report the error code and the English version of the error message (e. g. "Bad request"). Your file should also be valid HTML. The strings ERROR_MESSAGE, ERROR_CODE and RESOURCE, if they exist in the file, will be replaced with the English error message, the numeric error code and the path of the requested resource, respectively.
