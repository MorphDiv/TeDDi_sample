Help Index
At the time of writing, for most installations of & kde; the entire search engine function in & khelpcenter; is disabled, and settings made in this & kcontrol; module will have no effect. We hope to have it back in a future release.
& kde; comes with a lot of documentation for applications and components. While it is possible to just browse the manuals until you find that piece of information you're looking for, this may be a very time-consuming task. To make this easier for you, & kde; offers fulltext search using a program called ht: / /dig. It works quite similar to search engines on the web, in fact some search engines you know might even use it. Just click on the Search tab in the & khelpcenter;, enter the word you are looking for, click Search and enjoy!
However, to make use of this feature, ht: / /dig has to be installed on your system and & kde; has to be configured to make use of it. This control module tries to help you doing the latter. If you have n't installed ht: / /dig and it was n't shipped with your operating system you have to get ht: / /dig yourself. Have a look at the ht: / /dig homepage on how to download and install it.
When you first start, you are in display mode only. To modify your settings, click on Administrator Mode. If you are logged in as root, you will go straight to the change dialog. If not, & kde; will ask for a superuser password.
Use
There are two important things to tell & kde; so it can make use of the fulltext search engine:
where to find the ht: / /dig programs KDE uses for fulltext search
where to search
The ht: / /dig Programs
There are three programs & kde; needs that come with ht: / /dig: htdig, htsearch and htmerge. For each program you have to provide the full path including the program name, for example: / usr/ bin/ htdig.
Where exactly these programs are installed depends on your operating system or your distribution. However, there are some good guesses you might want to try:
htdig and htmerge are often found in / usr/ bin/ or in something like / usr/ local/ www/ htdig/ bin/.
the htsearch command is often found in a sub folder called cgi-bin, for example / usr/ local/ httpd/ cgi-bin/.
To find out where for example htdig is installed you can always type whereis htdig on the console. whereis will look for the specified command in the standard execution path folders. However, folders like cgi-bin are often not in the standard execution path.
Scope and Search Paths
In this section you can choose which help resources should be indexed, & ie; made available to the search engine.
In the Scope frame you can select some typical resources you want to be indexed, & ie; the & kde; help files, and the information offered by the man and info commands. Note that some of those may still be disabled, which means that support for them has not been added yet.
Maybe you have additional files you want to access using the & khelpcenter; fulltext search feature. For example, you might have an HTML reference installed in / home/ jdoe/ docs/ selfhtml. By adding this path to the list of additional search paths you make this documentation available to & khelpcenter; 's fulltext search, too. Just click on the Add button and a file dialog will ask you for an additional search folder. Select / home/ jdoe/ docs/ selfhtml and click OK. To remove an additional search path, just select it and click Delete.
Your changes to the scope and additional search paths will not take effect if you do n't click on the Generate index button.
