ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
& kommander; Development Team
& kommander; is a set of tools that allow you to create dynamic & GUI; dialogs that generate, based on their state, a piece of text. The piece of text can be a command line to a program, any piece of code, business documents that contain a lot of repetitious or templated text and so on. The resulting generated text can then be executed as a command line program (hence the name kommander;), written to a file, passed to a script for extended processing, and literally anything else you can think of. The best part of it all? You are n't required to write a single line of code!
