EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
PREOTACT
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Preotact?
Preotact is a white powder and solvent in a cartridge, which are made up into a solution for injection using a special injection pen.
Preotact contains the active substance parathyroid hormone.
What is Preotact used for?
Preotact is used for the treatment of osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile) in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of fractures.
Preotact has been shown to significantly reduce vertebral (spine) fractures, but not hip fractures.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Preotact used?
The recommended dose is 100 micrograms of Preotact given once daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) into the abdomen (tummy).
When the cartridge is inserted in the special injection pen and the pen screwed together, the powder and solvent mix to make up the solution for injection.
Patients may inject themselves once they have been trained to use the proper injection techniques (a user manual is supplied with the pen).
Patients may also need to take calcium and vitamin D supplements if they do not have enough from their diet.
Preotact can be used for up to 24 months, patients can then be treated with a bisphosphonate (a medicine that reduces bone loss).
How does Preotact work?
Osteoporosis happens when not enough new bone grows to replace the bone that is naturally broken down.
Gradually, the bones become thin and fragile, and more likely to break (fracture).
Osteoporosis is more common in women after the menopause, when the levels of the female hormone oestrogen fall.
Preotact contains parathyroid hormone, which stimulates bone formation by acting on osteoblasts (bone forming cells).
It also increases the absorption of calcium from food and prevents too much calcium being lost in the urine.
The active substance in Preotact, parathyroid hormone, is identical to the human parathyroid hormone.
It is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: the hormone is made by a bacterium that has received a gene (DNA) that makes it able to produce it.
How has Preotact been studied?
The main study was a large study of 2,532 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Preotact was compared with placebo (dummy treatment).
The main measure of effectiveness was the rate of vertebral fractures after 18 months of treatment.
About two-thirds of the women continued taking 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

The bone density was also the main measure in another study, which looked at the use of Preotact with or without alendronate (a biphosphonate).
What benefit has Preotact shown during the studies?
After 18 months, there were 42 vertebral fractures in the placebo group (3.37%) and 17 in the Preotact group (1.32%).
This shows that Preotact significantly reduces the risk of having a vertebral fracture in the women who take it, in comparison to placebo.
The risk reduction was higher in women who already had a fractured vertebra in the past, and in women whose score for spine bone density was already low at the start of the study, indicating that they have a more fragile spine.
Increases in bone density were also seen during the study.
The study of Preotact with alendronate showed that using alendronate after Preotact can bring further increases in the bone density.
What is the risk associated with Preotact?
The most common side effects are hypercalcaemia (increased blood calcium), hypercalciuria (increased urine calcium), and nausea (feeling sick).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Preotact, see the Package Leaflet.
Preotact should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to parathyroid hormone or any of the other ingredients.
It should also not be used in patients: • who have had radiation therapy to the skeleton, • who have any disorder that affects the calcium balance in the body, • who have a bone disease that is not osteoporosis, • with unexplained high levels of alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme), • with severe kidney or liver disease
Why has Preotact been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Preotact’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures.
They recommended that Preotact be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Preotact:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Preotact to Nycomed Danmark ApS on 24 April 2006.
