Naming Cells
Allowed names
Names in Calc can contain letters, numeric characters, and some special characters.
Names must start with a letter or an underline character.
Allowed special characters:
underline (_)
period (.) - allowed within a name, but not as first or last character
blank (Â ) - allowed within a name, but not as first or last character, and not for a cell range
Names must not be the same as cell references.
For example, the name A1 is invalid because A1 is a cell reference to the top left cell.
Names for cell ranges must not include blanks.
Blanks are allowed within names for single cells, sheets and documents.
Naming cells and formulae
Start
.
You can then write a formula such as &quot; =SUM(Start) &quot; .
Even after you insert or delete rows or columns, $[officename] still correctly assigns the ranges identified by name.
Range names must not contain any blanks.
For example, it is much easier to read a formula for value-added tax if you can write &quot; = Amount * VAT_rate &quot; instead of &quot; = A5 * B12 &quot; .
In this case, you would name cell A5 &quot; Amount &quot; and cell B12 &quot; VAT_rate. &quot;
Define Names
dialogue box to define names for formulae or parts of formulae you need more often.
In order to specify range names,
Insert - Names - Define
.
The

field.
Click
Add
.
The newly defined name appears in the list below.
Click OK to close the dialogue box.
You can also name other cell ranges in this dialogue box by entering the name in the field and then selecting the respective cells.
If you type the name in a formula, after the first few characters entered you will see the entire name as a tip.
Press the Enter key in order to accept the name from the tip.
If more than one name starts with the same characters, you can scroll through all the names using the Tab key.
