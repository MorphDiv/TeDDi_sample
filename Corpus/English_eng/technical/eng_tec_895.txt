The (Alt Graph) key can work in $[officename] like the Compose key, if you set the environment variable SAL_ALTGR_COMPOSE.

First press (Alt Graph), then the first modifier, then the second modifier.
The characters are combined as described on a Solaris system in the file /usr/openwin/include/X11/Suncompose.h.
