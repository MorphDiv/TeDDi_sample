Specifies the number of columns and the column layout for the section.
Sections follow the text flow behaviour of the page they are inserted into.
For example, if you insert a section that uses a two-column layout into a page style that uses a four-column layout, the two-column layout is nested inside one of the four columns.
You can also nest sections, that is, you can insert a section into another section.
