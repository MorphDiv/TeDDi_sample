ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
The smb ioslave enables you to browse the shares of a & Windows; (or Samba) network.
To see the workgroups, enter smb: /.
smb: / / a_workgroup will list the hosts in this workgroup.
To see the shares of a host, enter smb: / / the_host or smb: / a_workgroup / the_host.
To access a share directly enter smb: / / the_host/ the_share or smb: / a_workgroup / the_host / the_share
The smb ioslave requires that you have libsmbclient to use this ioslave.
You can set your default user name and password in the & systemsettings; in Network & Connectivity Sharing. This is especially useful if you are a member of a & Windows; NT domain. There you can also set your workgroup name, but in most cases this is not required. The kioslave will ask for your username and password if a default is not set.
This ioslave is tested and developed using mainly Samba 2.0.7, but other versions of Samba should work too.
