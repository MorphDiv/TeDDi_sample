Keyboard Repeat
If you check this option, pressing and holding down a key emits the same character over and over again. For example, pressing and holding down the Tab key will have the same effect as that of pressing that key several times in succession: Tab characters continue to be emitted until you release the key.
& Enable keyboard repeat
& Delay:
If supported, this option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes. The'Repeat rate 'option controls the frequency of these keycodes.
& Rate:
If supported, this option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed.
If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. This might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys, or if the sound that the keys make is very soft. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin box. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.
