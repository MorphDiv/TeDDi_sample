EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
TRUVADA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Truvada?
Truvada is a medicine containing two active substances emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg).
It is available as blue capsule-shaped tablets.
What is Truvada used for?
Truvada is an antiviral medicine.
It is used in combination with at least one other antiviral medicine to treat adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Truvada used?
Treatment with Truvada should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the management of HIV infection.
The recommended dose of Truvada is one tablet once a day, taken with food.
The tablets may need to be taken less frequently in patients with kidney disease.
Truvada is not recommended for patients who have severe problems with their kidneys or who require haemodialysis (a blood clearance technique).
In exceptional cases, patients who have difficulty swallowing can crush the tablet and mix it in about 100 ml of water, orange juice or grape juice before taking it immediately.
If patients need to stop taking emtricitabine or tenofovir, or need to take different doses, they will need to take medicines containing emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil separately.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
How does Truvada work?
Truvada contains two active substances: emtricitabine, which is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; and tenofovir disoproxil, which is a ‘ prodrug ’ of tenofovir.
Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor.
Both groups of medicines are known as NRTIs.
Both emtricitabine and tenofovir work in similar ways by blocking the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme produced by HIV that allows it to infect cells and make more viruses.
Truvada, taken in combination with at least one other antiviral medicine, reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.
Truvada does not cure HIV infection or AIDS, but it may delay the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.
Both active substances have been available in the European Union (EU) since the early 2000s: emtricitabine was granted marketing approval as Emtriva in 2003, and tenofovir disoproxil was granted marketing approval as Viread in 2002.

The main studies examined the effects of Truvada’ s active substances, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, in 683 treatment-naïve patients infected with HIV-1 (who had not taken treatment for HIV infection before).
The first study compared the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil to the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine (other antiviral medicines), both taken in combination with efavirenz (another antiviral medicine) in 487 patients.
The second study examined the effects of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, taken with lopinavir and ritonavir (other antiviral medicines) in 196 patients.
The main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of patients whose HIV levels in the blood (viral loads) had fallen to below 400 or 50 copies/ ml and were maintained below these levels until the 48th week of treatment.
The company also looked at the way the combined tablet was absorbed in the body in comparison with the separate medicines.
What benefit has Truvada shown during the studies?
Truvada’ s active substances, taken in combination with other antiviral medicines, reduced viral loads in the majority of patients and were more effective than the comparator medicines.
In the first study, 84% of the 244 patients taking Truvada achieved and maintained viral loads below 400 copies/ ml by 48 weeks, compared to 73% of the 243 taking the comparator medicines.
Around two thirds of the patients in the second study achieved and maintained viral loads below 50 copies/ ml after 48 weeks.
The combination tablet was absorbed in the body in the same way as the separate medicines.
What is the risk associated with Truvada?
The most common side effects with Truvada (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are hypophosphataemia (low levels of phosphates in the blood), headache, dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea (feeling sick) and raised blood levels of creatine kinase (an enzyme found in muscles).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Truvada, see the Package Leaflet.
Truvada should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to emtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or any of the other ingredients.
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Truvada may be at risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).
Patients who have problems with their liver (including hepatitis B or C infection) may be at an elevated risk of liver damage when taking Truvada.
As with all other NRTIs, Truvada may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Truvada during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells than can cause problems in the blood).
Why has Truvada been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Truvada’ s benefits are greater than its risks in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults.
It noted that the benefit of Truvada has only been shown in patients who have not taken HIV treatment before, but that the simplified dosing regimen offered by the combination tablet taken once a day may help patients to stick to their treatment.
The committee recommended that Truvada be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Truvada:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Truvada to Gilead Sciences International Limited on 21 February 2005.
