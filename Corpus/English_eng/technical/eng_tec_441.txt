Paste
Inserts the contents of the clipboard at the location of the cursor, and replaces any selected text or objects.
Click the arrow next to the icon to select the format.
In a spreadsheet, when you paste a range of cells from the clipboard, the result depends on the current selection:
If only one cell is selected, the cell range will be pasted started from that cell.
If you mark a cell range wider than the cell range in the clipboard, the cell range will be pasted repeatedly to fill the selected cell range.
