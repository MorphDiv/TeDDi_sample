Show custom bookmark label if available
Do not show the name of the share that is represented by the bookmark but the custom label that was defined in the bookmark editor.
Embed application into the system tray
Embed the application into the system tray. The system tray widget provides a popup menu with several commonly used tasks, so you do not need to bring up the main window every time. If this setting is chosen, you have to use "Quit" from the "File" menu or the system tray widget to exit the application.
Start docked
Start the application docked to the system tray, i. e. only the system tray widget is shown and the main window is hidden. You can bring the main window up by clicking on the system tray widget or by choosing "Restore" from its popup menu.
Show mounted shares in an icon view
The mounted shares will be displayed in an icon view.
Show mounted shares in a list view
The mounted shares will be displayed in a list view.
Show printer shares
Printer shares will be displayed in the network browser.
Show hidden shares
Hidden shares will be displayed in the network browser. Hidden shares are ending with a $sign, e. g. Musik$ or IPC$.
Show hidden IPC$ shares
Hidden IPC$ shares will be displayed in the network browser.
Show hidden ADMIN$ shares
Hidden ADMIN$ shares will be displayed in the network browser.
Show the type of the share
The type of a share will be displayed in a separate column in the network browser. It can either be Disk, Print or IPC.
Show the IP address of the server
The IP address of the server will be displayed in a separate column in the network browser.
Show the comment
The comment describing the server or share will be displayed in a separate column in the network browser.
Show a tooltip with information about the network item
The tooltip shows various information about the current network item.
Show the mount point instead of the share name
A share is normally displayed with its name in the shares view. Choosing this feature will cause the exchange of the share name by the mount point.
Show all shares that are mounted on the system
You will not only see the shares that were mounted and are owned by you, but also all other mounts using the SMBFS and CIFS file system that are present on the system.
Show a tooltip with information about the share
The tooltip shows various information about the current share.
Show the owner and group
Show the UID and GID that own all files on the mounted file system.
Show the login
Show the login that was used to authenticate to the server. The column will only contain an entry if the share was mounted with the CIFS file system.
Show the file system
Show the file system that was used for mounting the share.
Show the free disk space
Show the free disk space that is left on the share.
Show the used disk space
Show the disk space that is already used on the share.
Show the total disk space
Show the total disk space of the share.
Show the disk usage
Show the space that is used on the share (as a percentage.)
Preview hidden files and directories
Display hidden files and directories in the preview dialog. The hidden files and directories are those whose names begin with a period. They are usually needed for very specific purposes (storing the configuration information for an application, etc.). Since they are not of any importance for your regular work, you normally do not need to enable this feature.
Scan the network neighborhood for available workgroups and domains
This is the default method to retrieve the initial browse list. It discovers all workgroups and domains by looking for all known master browsers on your network neighborhood.
Query the current workgroup master browser
This method queries the current master browser of your workgroup or domain to retrieve the initial browse list.
Query this custom master browser:
This method queries a custom master browser to retrieve the initial browse list.
A custom master browser that is to be queried
Enter the name or IP address of a master browser here that should be queried to compile the initial browse list.
Scan these broadcast areas:
This method will scan the given broadcast areas and look for all registered hosts.
A custom list of broadcast addresses
Enter a comma-separated list of broadcast addresses here (e. g. 192.168.0.255, 192.168.1.255). It is used to scan for all known hosts in the respective broadcast areas.
The master browsers require authentication to return the browse list
The master browsers in your network neighborhood require a login and password to return the browse list. This setting is rarely needed and might even cause a master browser to return an empty browse list. It will not have any effect when you let Smb4K scan broadcast areas.
Mount prefix:
This is the prefix where Smb4K will create the mount points and mount the remote shares.
Force generated subdirectories to be lower case
All names of the subdirectories created by Smb4K below the mount prefix will be lowercase.
Unmount all personal shares on exit
Unmount all shares that belong to you when the program exits. Shares that are owned by other users are ignored.
Remount recently used shares on program start
Remount all your shares that were mounted when you exited the program. If a remount fails, Smb4K will retry the next time it is started. Shares that were mounted by other users are ignored.
Allow the unmounting of shares that are owned by other users
Allow the unmounting of shares that were mounted by other users. In most cases you need super user privileges for this. Please think before you enable this option.
Interval between checks:
This is the time that elapses until Smb4K checks again for new mounts and unmounts. The lower limit is 500 ms, the upper one 300000 ms. Please note that the smaller the interval gets the higher is your system load.
Save logins in a wallet
Use a wallet to store the authentication data. The login name and the password name are stored encrypted on your hard drive. If this setting is disabled, the authentication data is not stored permanently but only temporarily.
Remember logins during program run
If you decided to store your logins temporarily, Smb4K will remember them only until the program exits. If you disable this setting, you will have to provide the authentication data every time it is needed.
Use a default login
Enable the usage of a default login name and password. The authentication data provided below is then used by default to authenticate to a remote server. This is very useful e. g. if you are working in an Active Directory environment or an NT domain.
NetBIOS name:
This is the NetBIOS name of this computer that is used by Smb4K. By default, it is either the NetBIOS name that is defined in the smb. conf file or the host name.
Domain:
This is the workgroup or domain this computer is or should be in. By default, it is the workgroup that is defined in the smb. conf file.
Socket options:
These are the TCP socket options that are used by nmblookup, smbmount and smbclient. Socket options are controls on the networking layer of the operating systems which allow the connection to be tuned. See the manual page of smb. conf for more information.
NetBIOS scope:
This sets the NetBIOS scope that nmblookup, smbmount and smbclient will operate under. It should not be set unless every machine on your network neighborhood sets this value.
SMB port:
This is the port that is used for connecting to remote servers with the client programs net, smbclient and smbtree. The default value is 139 (NetBIOS). This setting is not used for mounting.
File system port:
This is the port that is exclusively used to mount shares from remote servers. The default value is 445 (CIFS file system).
Try to authenticate with Kerberos
Try to authenticate with Kerberos. This is only useful in an Active Directory environment. The setting affects the smbclient and smbtree command.
Authenticate with local machine account
Make queries to the remote server using the machine account of the local server. The setting affects the net, smbclient, and smbtree command.
Signing state:
Set the signing state. This setting affects the smbclient and smbtree command.

Client character set:
This is the character set that is used by the client side (i. e. your side) either to convert local path names to and from Unicode (CIFS, Linux) or for codepage to charset translations (SMBFS, FreeBSD). If you keep the default setting, Smb4K will try to automatically determine the charset by looking up the "unix charset" option in the smb. conf.

unicode
This is the user ID (a number) that the files and directories of the mounted share will have. If you are using the CIFS file system and the remote server supports the CIFS Unix Extensions, this setting will be ignored.
This is the group ID (a number) that the files and directories of the mounted share will have. If you are using the CIFS file system and the remote server supports the CIFS Unix Extensions, this setting will be ignored.
File mask:
This is the mask that will be used for creating files. It must be defined in octal. In case the CIFS file system is used, this setting only takes effect if the server does not support the CIFS Unix Extensions.
Directory mask:
This is the mask that will be used for creating directories. It must be defined in octal. In case the CIFS file system is used, this setting only takes effect if the server does not support the CIFS Unix Extensions.
Here you can choose if the shares should be mounted in read and write mode or only read-only.
Do permission checks
The client side (i. e. your side) will check if you have the right UID/ GID to manipulate a file or directory. You might want to switch this feature off if the server(s) support the CIFS Unix Extensions and you are not allowed to access the files and directories. This setting does not affect the normal ACL check.
Attempt to set UID and GID
In case the server supports the CIFS Unix Extensions, the client side (i. e. your side) attempts to set the effective UID and GID of the current process on newly created files, directories and devices. If this feature is turned off, the default UID and GID defined for the share will be used. It is recommended that you read the manual page of mount. cifs before you change this setting.
Use server inode numbers
Use inode numbers (unique persistent file identifiers) returned by the server instead of automatically generating temporary inode numbers on the client side.
Do not cache inode data
Directly read from and write to files opened on the share. In some cases this can provide better performance than the default behavior which caches reads and writes.
Translate reserved characters
Translate six of the seven reserved characters (including the colon, question mark, pipe, asterisk, greater than and less than characters but not the backslash) to remap range (above 0xF000). This allows you to open files that were created with such characters. This has no effect if the server does not support Unicode.
Do not use locking
Do not use locking. Do not start lockd.
Additional options:
Here you can enter advanced options for the CIFS file system in a comma-separated list (refer to the manual page of mount. cifs to learn more). The list will be added AS IS to the "-o" argument of mount. cifs. Please do not enter options that have already been defined in the configuration dialog.
Protocol hint:
Here you can choose the protocol that will be used by the net command for the communication with remote servers if appropriate. In most cases the automatic detection will work fine and you should not need to change the default setting. However, if you experience problems, use the RPC protocol for newer operating systems (Windows NT4 and above) and the RAP protocol for older ones (Windows 98/ NT3 and below). Functions that need the ADS protocol (for Active Directory environments) have not been implemented yet, so you can ignore that one for now.
Automatic detection
RPC: Modern operating systems
RAP: Older operating systems
ADS: Active Directory environment (LDAP/ Kerberos)
Name resolve order:
This option is used to determine what naming services and in what order are used to resolve host names and IP addresses. It takes a space-separated list of up to four different name resolution options. Those are: lmhost, host, wins, bcast. See the manual page of smbclient for further information.
Buffer size:
This option changes the transmit/ send buffer size when getting or putting a file from/ to the server. The default is 65520 bytes. Setting this value smaller has been observed to speed up file transfers to and from Windows 9x servers.
Broadcast address:
Queries performed with nmblookup will be send to the given broadcast address. Without this option the default behavior is to send the queries to the broadcast address of the network interface that was either auto-detected or defined in the "interfaces" parameter of the smb. conf file.
Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP datagrams
Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP datagrams. The reason for this option is a bug in Windows 95 where it ignores the source port of the requesting packet and only replies to UDP port 137. Unfortunately, on most Unix systems super user privileges are needed to bind to this port. Please read the manual page of nmblookup for more information.
Send requests as broadcasts
Let smbtree query the network nodes by sending requests as broadcasts instead of querying the local master browser.
Synchronization prefix:
This is the path where Smb4K will store the files and directories during synchronization. If you plan to synchronize only with one remote share, then you can put the data directly in this directory. If you want to synchronize with several remote shares, then you should create a subdirectory for each share and choose the appropriate one in the synchronization dialog.
Archive mode
Use archive mode (-a, --archive). This is a short form of -rlptgoD.
Recurse into subdirectories
Recurse into directories (-r, --recursive).
Update files
Update files in the destination directory that are older than in the source directory (-u, --update).
Update files in place
Update destination files in-place (--inplace). By default, rsync first creates a new copy of a file and moves it into place after its transfer finished. If you enable this feature, no copy will be created but the destination file will immediately be overwritten instead. An exception to this is if you combine this option with --backup.
Use relative path names
Use relative paths (-R, --relative). This means that the full path names specified on the command line are sent to the server rather than just the last parts of the file names.
Do not send implied directories
Do not send implied directories with --relative (--no-implied-dirs). This means that the corresponding path elements on the destination system are left unchanged if they exist, and any missing implied directories are created with default attributes. This even allows these implied path elements to have big differences, such as being a symlink to a directory on one side of the transfer, and a real directory on the other side.
Transfer directories without recursing
Transfer directories without recursing (-d, --dirs). This means that all top-level subdirectories are transferred but without their contents.
Compress data during transfer
Compress data during transfer (-z, --compress). This significantly reduces the amount of data that is being transferred. You may want to use this option, if you have a slow connection.
Preserve symlinks
Copy symlinks as symlinks (-l, --links).
Transform symlinks
Transform symlinks into the items they are pointing to (-L, --copy-links).
Only transform unsafe symlinks
Transform unsafe symlinks into the items they are pointing to (--copy-unsafe-links). This means that only those symlinks are transformed that point to items that are outside the copied tree. Absolute symlinks are treated the same way. This option has no additional effect if --copy-links has also been specified.
Ignore unsafe symlinks
Ignore symlinks that point outside the copied tree (--safe-links). All absolute symlinks are also ignored. If you use this option in conjunction with --relative you might get unexpected results.
Preserve hard links
Preserve hard links (-H, --hard-links). This options causes rsync to preserve the hard links that are found during the transfer. Without it, hard links are treated as though they were separate files.
Keep directory symlinks
Treat symlinked directories on the receiving side as though they were real ones (-K, --keep-dirlinks). This only works if the symlink matches a real directory from the sending side. Without this option, the receiver's symlink will be deleted and replaced with a real directory.
Preserve permissions
Preserve permissions (-p, --perms). The permissions of the destination file will be same as the source file. For what happens if this option is switched off, please read rsync's manual page.
Preserve group
Preserve the group (-g, --group). The group of the destination file will be set to the same value as the source file.
Preserve owner
Preserve the owner (-o, --owner). The owner of the destination file will be set to the same value as the source file, but only if the receiving rsync is run as the super user. Without this option, the owner is set to the invoking user on the receiving side.
Preserve device and special files
Preserve device and special files (-D, --devices --specials). This option causes rsync to transfer character and block devices as well as special files such as named sockets and fifos. It works only partially if rsync is not run as super user and the --super option is not specified.
Preserve times
Preserve times (-t, --times). The modification times are transferred along with the files. For what happens if this option is switched off, please read rsync's manual page.
Omit directories when preserving times
Omit directories when preserving times (-O, --omit-dir-times). This means that directories are omitted when modification times are being preserved. Thus, this feature only works in conjunction with --times.
Remove synchronized source files
Remove all synchronized source files (--remove-source-files). This tells rsync to remove from the sending side the non-directory items that are a part of the transfer and have been successfully duplicated on the receiving side.
Delete extraneous files
Delete extraneous files from destination (--delete). This tells rsync to delete all files from the receiving side that are not present on the sending side, but only for the directories that are being synchronized.
Delete files before transfer
Delete files on the receiving side before the transfer starts (--delete-before). This is the default behavior if --delete or --delete-excluded is specified without one of the --delete-WHEN options.
Delete files after transfer
Delete files on the receiving side after the transfer has completed (--delete-after, --del).
Delete files during transfer
Delete files on the receiving side during the transfer (--delete-during). This method is faster than --delete-before or --delete-after, but it is only supported with rsync 2.6.4 or later.
Also delete excluded files
Also delete excluded files from destination directory (--delete-excluded). In addition to deleting the files on the receiving side that are not on the sending side, this tells rsync to also delete any files on the receiving side that are excluded. Refer to rsync's manual page for further information.
Delete even if I/ O errors occur
Delete even if I/ O errors occur (--ignore-errors). This option has to be specified in conjunction with --delete to take effect.
Force deletion of non-void directories
Force deletion of directories even if they are not empty (--force). This option tells rsync to delete a non-empty directory when it is to be replaced by a non-directory. This is only relevant if deletions are not active.
Do not delete more than this many files:
Only delete as many files as defined here (--max-delete=NUM). This tells rsync not to delete more than NUM files or directories (NUM must be non-zero). This is useful when mirroring very large trees to prevent disasters.
Value for DeleteMaximum config entry
Do not transfer any file smaller than:
This option causes rsync to not transfer any file that is smaller than the specified size (--min-size=SIZE).
Value for MinimalTransferSize config entry
Do not transfer any file larger than:
This option causes rsync to not transfer any file that is larger than the specified size (--max-size=SIZE).
Value for MaximalTransferSize config entry
Keep partially transferred files
Keep partially transferred files (--partial). The default behavior is that any partially transferred file is deleted if the transfer is interrupted.
Put partially transferred files into:
Put a partially transferred file into this directory (--partial-dir=DIR). This is a better way than the --partial option to keep partial files, because the partially transferred file is kept in a different directory and the destination file is not overwritten.
The data for the UsePartialDirectory option
Auto-ignore files in the same way CVS does
Auto-ignore files in the same way CVS does (-C, --cvs-exclude). This is a useful shorthand for excluding a broad range of files that you often do not want to transfer between systems. This option uses the same algorithm that CVS uses to determine if a file should be ignored.
Exclude files matching this pattern:
Exclude files that match a certain pattern (--exclude=PATTERN). This is a special filter rule. For further information on filter rules see rsync's manual page.
Pattern that is used for file exclusion
Read exclude patterns from:
Read exclude patterns from a file (--exclude-from=FILE). This option is similar to the --exclude=PATTERN option except that the exclude patterns are read from a file. This is a special filter rule. For further information on filter rules see rsync's manual page.
The file from which the exclude patterns are read
Do not exclude files matching this pattern:
Do not exclude files matching a certain pattern (--include=PATTERN). This is a special filter rule. For further information on filter rules see rsync's manual page.
Pattern that is used for file inclusion
Read include patterns from:
Read include patterns from a file (--include-from=FILE). This option is similar to the --include=PATTERN option except that the include patterns are read from a file. This is a special filter rule. For further information on filter rules see rsync's manual page.
The file from which the include patterns are read
Custom filter rules:
Add custom file-filtering rules (-f, --filter=RULE). This option allows you to add rules to selectively exclude certain files from the list of files to be transferred. These rules will be added to the rsync command as they are. Thus, each rule has to start with the --filter=... argument.
Use --filter='dir-merge /. rsync-filter 'filter rule
This filter rule tells rsync to look for per-directory. rsync-filter files that have been sprinkled through the hierarchy and use their rules to filter the files in the transfer. It has no effect, if you also choose to use the --filter='exclude. rsync-filter 'rule.
Use --filter='exclude. rsync-filter 'filter rule
This rule filters out the. rsync-filter files from the transfer. These files normally contain filter rules that can be activated by choosing the --filter='dir-merge /. rsync-filter 'rule and deselecting this one.
Handle sparse files efficiently
Handle sparse files efficiently (-S, --sparse) so that they take up less space on the destination. This option conflicts with --inplace. For further information read rsync's manual page.
Copy files whole (no rsync algorithm)
Copy files whole (-W, --whole-file). With this option the incremental rsync algorithm is not used and the whole file is sent as-is instead.
Do not cross file system boundaries
Do not cross file system boundaries (-x, --one-file-system). This tells rsync to avoid crossing a filesystem boundary when recursing. For further information on this option, read the manual page.
Only update files that already exist
Skip creating new files on the receiving side (--existing). This tells rsync to skip creating files (including directories) that do not exist yet on the destination. If this option is combined with the --ignore-existing option, no files will be updated (which can be useful if all you want to do is to delete extraneous files).
Ignore files that already exist
Skip updating files that already exist on the receiving side (--ignore-existing). Existing directories are not ignored.
Delay updates until the end of transfer
Delay updates until the end of the transfer (--delay-updates). This option puts the temporary file from each updated file into a holding directory until the end of the transfer, at which time all the files are renamed and copied into place in rapid succession.
Make backups
Make backups (-b, --backup). With this option, preexisting destination files are renamed as each file is transferred or deleted. You can control where the backup file goes and what (if any) suffix gets appended using the --backup-dir=DIR and --suffix=SUFFIX options.
Backup suffix:
Use this suffix for backups (--suffix=SUFFIX).
Backup suffix
Backup directory:
Store backups in this directory (--backup-dir=DIR).
Backup directory
Force fixed checksum block size:
Force a fixed checksum block-size (-B, --block-size=SIZE). This forces the block size used in the rsync algorithm to a fixed value.
The block size
Set block/ file checksum seed:
Set block/ file checksum seed (--checksum-seed=NUM). Set the MD4 checksum seed to this integer. This 4 byte checksum seed is included in each block and file MD4 checksum calculation. By default the checksum seed is generated by the server and defaults to the current time.
The checksum seed
Skip files based on checksum
Skip files based on a checksum and not based on modification time and size (-c, --checksum). For further information on how this feature works read rsync's manual page.
Use super user privileges to force the unmounting of (inaccessible) shares
Unmount a share under Linux by force. This even works if the file system is "busy", because it is immediately detached from the file system hierarchy and all references to it are cleaned up later when it is not busy anymore. Linux kernel 2.4.11 or later is needed to take advantage of this feature. Use with care. Note, that you will need the root password to write the necessary changes to the configuration file.
Use super user privileges to mount and unmount shares
Use super user privileges for mounting and unmounting remote shares. This feature is only needed, if you are not allowed to use smbmount, smbumount, mount. cifs and umount. cifs as normal user. Note, that you will need the root password to write the necessary changes to the configuration file.
Unmount all shares when the sleep button is pressed
Unmount all mounted shares after the hardware sleep button is pressed. The shares will automatically be remounted after the computer wakes up again.
Unmount all shares when the lid is closed
Unmount all mounted shares after the lid of the laptop is closed. The shares will automatically be remounted after the computer wakes up again.
Unmount all shares when the power button is pressed
Unmount all mounted shares after the hardware power button is pressed. The shares will automatically be remounted after the computer wakes up again.
Unmount all shares when the network is disconnected
Unmount all shares when the user disconnects from the network or the connection is lost due to a different reason. Using this option in combination with sleep and/ or hibernation might lead to unwanted side effects. In this case you should unmount the shares manually before you suspend the computer.

Smb4K uses "nmblookup" by default to search for remote hosts. This method is very reliable but fails sometimes if your network neighborhood is configured uncommonly. In this case you should try to use "smbclient".
Use nmblookup (recommended)
