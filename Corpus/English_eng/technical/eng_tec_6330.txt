effects
Active screen edges allow you to activate effects by pushing your mouse cursor against the edge of the screen. Here you can configure which effect will get activated on each edge and corner of the screen.
Click with any mouse button onto a square and select an effect in the context menu. Edges with a black square have already an attached effect, a grey colored square indicates that no effect is selected for this edge.
