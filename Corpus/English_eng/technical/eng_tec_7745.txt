ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1 NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Thymanax 25 mg film-coated tablets
2 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each film-coated tablet contains 25 mg of agomelatine.
Excipient: lactose monohydrate 61.84 mg
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3 PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet [tablet].
Orange-yellow, oblong, film-coated tablet with blue imprint of company logo on one side.
4 CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of major depressive episodes in adults
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dose is 25 mg once daily taken orally at bedtime.
After two weeks of treatment, if there is no improvement of symptoms, the dose may be increased to 50 mg once daily, i. e. two 25 mg tablets, taken together at bedtime.
Liver function tests should be performed in all patients: at initiation of treatment, and then periodically after around six weeks (end of acute phase), twelve weeks and twenty four weeks (end of maintenance phase) and thereafter when clinically indicated (see also section 4.4).
Patients with depression should be treated for a sufficient period of at least 6 months to ensure that they are free of symptoms.
Thymanax tablets may be taken with or without food.
Children and adolescents:
Thymanax is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 4.4).
Elderly patients:
Efficacy has not been clearly demonstrated in the elderly (≥ 65 years).
Only limited clinical data is available on the use of Thymanax in elderly patients ≥ 65 years old with major depressive episodes.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing Thymanax to these patients (see section 4.4).
Patients with renal impairment:
No relevant modification in agomelatine pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with severe renal impairment has been observed.
However, only limited clinical data on the use of Thymanax in depressed patients with severe or moderate renal impairment with major depressive episodes is available.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing Thymanax to these patients.
Patients with hepatic impairment:
2 Thymanax is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).
Treatment discontinuation:
No dosage tapering is needed on treatment discontinuation.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Hepatic impairment (i. e. cirrhosis or active liver disease) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Concomitant use of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e. g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) (see section 4.5).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Use in children and adolescents:
Thymanax is not recommended in the treatment of depression in patients under 18 years of age since safety and efficacy of Thymanax have not been established in this age group.
In clinical trials among children and adolescents treated with other antidepressants, suicide-related behaviour (suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) were more frequently observed compared to those treated with placebo.
Use in elderly patients with dementia:
Thymanax should not be used for the treatment of major depressive episodes in elderly patients with dementia since the safety and efficacy of Thymanax have not been established in these patients.
Mania / Hypomania:
Thymanax should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or hypomania and should be discontinued if a patient develops manic symptoms.
Suicide/ suicidal thoughts:
Depression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide- related events).
This risk persists until significant remission occurs.
As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs.
It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery.
Patients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal ideation prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment.
A meta-analysis of placebo- controlled clinical trials of antidepressants in adult patients with psychiatric disorders showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo, in patients less than 25 years old.
Close supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany treatment especially in early treatment and following dose changes.
Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted to the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.
Combination with CYP1A2 inhibitors (see sections 4.3 and 4.5) Combination with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing Thymanax with moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e. g. propranolol, grepafloxacine, enoxacine) which may result in increased exposure of agomelatine.
Increased serum transaminases:
In clinical studies, elevations of serum transaminases (> 3 times the upper limit of the normal range) have been observed in patients treated with Thymanax particularly on a 50 mg dose (see section 4.8).
When Thymanax was discontinued in these patients, the serum transaminases usually returned to normal levels.
Liver function tests should be performed in all patients: at initiation of treatment and then periodically after around six weeks (end of acute phase), after around twelve and twenty four weeks (end of maintenance phase) and thereafter when clinically indicated.
Any patient who develops
3 increased serum transaminases should have his/ her liver function tests repeated within 48 hours.
Therapy should be discontinued if the increase in serum transaminases exceeds 3X upper limit of normal and liver function tests should be performed regularly until serum transaminases return to normal.
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction liver function tests should be performed.
The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with Thymanax should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations.
If jaundice is observed therapy should be discontinued.
Caution should be exercised when Thymanax is administered to patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol or who are treated with medicinal products associated with risk of hepatic injury.
Lactose intolerance:
Thymanax contains lactose.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential interactions affecting agomelatine:
Agomelatine is metabolised mainly by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) (90%) and by CYP2C9/ 19 (10%).
Medicinal products that interact with these isoenzymes may decrease or increase the bioavailability of agomelatine.
Fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 and moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor markedly inhibits the metabolism of agomelatine resulting in a 60-fold (range 12-412) increase of agomelatine exposure.
Consequently, co-administration of Thymanax with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e. g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated.
Combination of agomelatine with oestrogens (moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors) results in a several fold increased exposure of agomelatine.
While there was no specific safety signal in the 800 patients treated in combination with oestrogens, caution should be exercised when prescribing agomelatine with other moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e. g. propranolol, grepafloxacine, enoxacine) until more experience has been gained (see section 4.4).
Potential for agomelatine to affect other medicinal products:
In vivo, agomelatine does not induce CYP450 isoenzymes.
Agomelatine inhibits neither CYP1A2 in vivo nor the other CYP450 in vitro.
Therefore, agomelatine will not modify exposure to medicinal products metabolised by CYP 450.
Medicinal products highly bound to plasma protein:
Agomelatine does not modify free concentrations of medicinal products highly bound to plasma proteins or vice versa.
Other medicinal products:
No evidence of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with medicinal products which could be prescribed concomitantly with Thymanax in the target population was found in phase I clinical trials: benzodiazepines, lithium, paroxetine, fluconazole and theophylline.
Alcohol:
The combination of Thymanax and alcohol is not advisable.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT):
There is no experience of concurrent use of agomelatine with ECT.
Animal studies have not shown proconvulsant properties (see section 5.3).
Therefore, clinical consequences of ECT concomitant treatment with Thymanax are considered to be unlikely.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
For agomelatine, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition
4 or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.
It is not known whether agomelatine is excreted into human milk.
Agomelatine or its metabolites are excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Potential effects of agomelatine on the breast-feeding infant have not been established.
If treatment with Thymanax is considered necessary, breastfeeding should be discontinued.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, considering that dizziness and somnolence are common adverse reactions patients should be cautioned about their ability to drive a car or operate machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In clinical trials, over 3,900 depressed patients have received Thymanax.
Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate and occurred within the first two weeks of treatment.
The most common adverse reactions were nausea and dizziness.
These adverse reactions were usually transient and did not generally lead to cessation of therapy.
Depressed patients display a number of symptoms that are associated with the illness itself.
It is therefore sometimes difficult to ascertain which symptoms are a result of the illness itself and which are a result of treatment with Thymanax.
Adverse reactions are listed below using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
The frequencies have not been corrected for placebo.
Nervous system disorders:
Common: headache, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, migraine Uncommon: paraesthesia
Eye disorders:
Uncommon: blurred vision
Gastrointestinal disorders:
Common: nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, upper abdominal pain
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common: hyperhidrosis Uncommon: eczema Rare: erythematous rash
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Common: back pain
General disorders and administration site conditions:
Common: fatigue
Hepato-biliary disorders:
Common: increases (> 3 times the upper limit of the normal range) in ALAT and/ or ASAT (i. e.
1.1% on agomelatine 25/ 50 mg vs.
0.7% on placebo).
Rare: hepatitis
Psychiatric disorders:
Common: anxiety Frequency not known:
Suicidal thoughts or behaviour (see section 4.4)
5 4.9 Overdose
There is limited experience with agomelatine overdose.
During the clinical development, there were a few reports of agomelatine overdose, taken alone (up to 450 mg) or in combination (up to 525 mg) with other psychotropic medicinal products.
Signs and symptoms of overdose were limited and included drowsiness and epigastralgia.
No specific antidotes for agomelatine are known.
Management of overdose should consist of treatment of clinical symptoms and routine monitoring.
Medical follow-up in a specialised environment is recommended.
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Other antidepressants, ATC-code:
NO6AX22
Agomelatine is a melatonergic agonist (MT1 and MT2 receptors) and 5-HT2C antagonist.
Binding studies indicate that agomelatine has no effect on monoamine uptake and no affinity for α, β adrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and benzodiazepine receptors.
Agomelatine resynchronises circadian rhythms in animal models of circadian rhythm disruption.
Agomelatine increases noradrenaline and dopamine release specifically in the frontal cortex and has no influence on the extracellular levels of serotonin.
Agomelatine has shown an antidepressant-like effect in animal models of depression (learned helplessness test, despair test, chronic mild stress) as well as in models with circadian rhythm desynchronisation and in models related to stress and anxiety.
In humans, Thymanax has positive phase shifting properties; it induces a phase advance of sleep, body temperature decline and melatonin onset.
The efficacy and safety of Thymanax in major depressive episodes have been studied in a clinical programme including 5,800 patients of whom 3,900 were treated with Thymanax.
Six placebo controlled trials have been performed to investigate the short term efficacy of Thymanax in major depressive disorder: two flexible dose studies and four fixed dose studies.
At the end of treatment (over 6 or 8 weeks), significant efficacy of agomelatine 25-50 mg was demonstrated in 3 of the six short-term double-blind placebo-controlled studies.
Agomelatine failed to differentiate from placebo in one study where the active control fluoxetine showed assay sensitivity.
In two other studies, it was not possible to draw any conclusions because the active controls, paroxetine and fluoxetine, failed to differentiate from placebo.
Efficacy was also observed in more severely depressed patients (baseline HAM-D ≥ 25) in all positive placebo-controlled studies.
Response rates were statistically significantly higher with Thymanax compared with placebo.
The maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated in a relapse prevention study.
Patients responding to 8/ 10-weeks of acute treatment with open-label Thymanax 25-50 mg once daily were randomised to either Thymanax 25-50 mg once daily or placebo for further 6-months.
Thymanax 25- 50 mg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant superiority compared to placebo (p=0.0001) on the primary outcome measure, the prevention of depressive relapse, as measured by time to relapse.
The incidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow up period was 22% and 47% for Thymanax and placebo, respectively.
Thymanax does not alter daytime vigilance and memory in healthy volunteers.
In depressed patients, treatment with Thymanax 25 mg increased slow wave sleep without modification of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep amount or REM latency.
Thymanax 25 mg also induced an advance of the time of sleep onset and of minimum heart rate.
From the first week of treatment, onset of sleep and the quality of sleep were significantly improved without daytime clumsiness as assessed by patients.
6 In a specific sexual dysfunction comparative study with remitted depressed patients, there was a numerical trend (not statistically significant) towards less sexual emergent dysfunction than venlafaxine for Sex Effects Scale (SEXFX) drive arousal or orgasm scores on Thymanax.
The pooled analysis of studies using the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) showed that Thymanax was not associated with sexual dysfunction.
In healthy volunteers Thymanax preserved sexual function in comparison with paroxetine.
Thymanax had neutral effect on body weight, heart rate and blood pressure in clinical studies.
In a study designed to assess discontinuation symptoms by the Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) check-list in patients with remitted depression, Thymanax did not induce discontinuation syndrome after abrupt treatment cessation.
Thymanax has no abuse potential as measured in healthy volunteer studies on a specific visual analogue scale or the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) 49 check-list.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption and bioavailability:
Agomelatine is rapidly and well (≥ 80%) absorbed after oral administration.
Absolute bioavailability is low (< 5% at the therapeutic oral dose) and the interindividual variability is substantial.
The bioavailability is increased in women compared to men.
The bioavailability is increased by intake of oral contraceptives and reduced by smoking.
The peak plasma concentration is reached within 1 to 2 hours.
In the therapeutic dose-range, agomelatine systemic exposure increases proportionally with dose.
At higher doses, a saturation of the first-pass effect occurs.
Food intake (standard meal or high fat meal) does not modify the bioavailability or the absorption rate.
The variability is increased with high fat food.
Distribution:
Steady state volume of distribution is about 35 l and plasma protein binding is 95% irrespective of the concentration and is not modified with age and in patients with renal impairment but the free fraction is doubled in patients with hepatic impairment.
Biotransformation:
Following oral administration, agomelatine is rapidly metabolised mainly via hepatic CYP1A2; CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 isoenzymes are also involved but with a low contribution.
The major metabolites, hydroxylated and demethylated agomelatine, are not active and are rapidly conjugated and eliminated in the urine.
Elimination:
Elimination is rapid, the mean plasma half-life is between 1 and 2 hours and the clearance is high (about 1,100 ml/ min) and essentially metabolic.
Excretion is mainly (80%) urinary and in the form of metabolites, whereas unchanged compound recovery in urine is negligible.
Kinetics are not modified after repeated administration.
Renal impairment:
No relevant modification of pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with severe renal impairment has been observed (n=8, single dose of 25 mg), but caution should be exercised in patients with severe or moderate renal impairment as only limited clinical data are available in these patients (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment:
In a specific study involving cirrhotic patients with chronic mild (Child-Pugh type A) or moderate (Child-Pugh type B) liver impairment, exposure to agomelatine 25 mg was substantially increased (70- times and 140-times, respectively), compared to matched volunteers (age, weight and smoking habit) with no liver failure (see section 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4).
7 Ethnic groups:
There is no data on the influence of race on agomelatine pharmacokinetics.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In mice, rats and monkeys sedative effects were observed after single and repeated administration at high doses.
In rodents, a marked induction of CYP2B and a moderate induction of CYP1A and CYP3A were seen from 125 mg/ kg/ day whereas in monkeys the induction was slight for CYP2B and CYP3A at 375 mg/ kg/ day.
No hepatotoxicity was observed in rodents and monkeys in the repeat dose toxicity studies.
Agomelatine passes into the placenta and foetuses of pregnant rats.
Reproduction studies in the rat and the rabbit showed no effect of agomelatine on fertility, embryofoetal development and pre- and post natal development.
A battery of in vitro and in vivo standard genotoxicity assays concludes to no mutagenic or clastogenic potential of agomelatine.
In carcinogenicity studies agomelatine induced an increase in the incidence of liver tumours in the rat and the mouse, at a dose at least 110-fold higher than the therapeutic dose.
Liver tumours are most likely related to enzyme induction specific to rodents.
The frequency of benign mammary fibroadenomas observed in the rat was increased with high exposures (60-fold the exposure at the therapeutic dose) but remains in the range of that of controls.
Safety pharmacology studies showed no effect of agomelatine on hERG (human Ether à-go-go Related Gene) current or on dog Purkinje cells action potential.
Agomelatine did not show proconvulsive properties at ip doses up to 128 mg/ kg in mice and rats.

Further information
1.
WHAT THYMANAX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Thymanax belongs to a group of medicines called antidepressants and you have been given Thymanax to treat your depression.
Depression is a continuing disturbance of mood that interferes with everyday life.
The symptoms of depression vary from one person to another, but often include deep sadness, feelings of worthlessness, loss of interest in favourite activities, sleep disturbances, feeling of being slowed down, feelings of anxiety, changes in weight.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE THYMANAX
Do not take Thymanax
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to agomelatine or any of the other ingredients of Thymanax (see
‘ What Thymanax contains ’ in section 6).
- if you are taking fluvoxamine (another medicine used in the treatment of depression) or
ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic).
- if your liver does not work properly (hepatic impairment).
Take special care with Thymanax There could be some reasons why Thymanax may not be suitable for you:
- If you have already experienced or if you develop manic symptoms (a period of abnormally high
excitability and emotions) talk to your doctor before you start taking this medicine or continue with this medicine.
- If you are taking medicine known to affect the liver.
Ask your doctor for advice on which medicine
that is.
Some patients may get increased levels of liver enzymes in their blood during treatment with Thymanax.
Your doctor will therefore run laboratory tests to check that your liver is working
19 properly at the initiation of the treatment and then periodically during treatment.
Based on the evaluation of these tests the doctor will decide whether you should continue using Thymanax or not (see also under “ How to take Thymanax ” in section 3).
- If you are suffering from dementia, your doctor will make an individual evaluation of whether it is
safe for you to take Thymanax.
Thymanax is not intended for use in children and adolescents (under 18 years old).
Thoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression If you are depressed you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or killing yourself.
These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer.
You may be more likely to think like this:
- if you have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself.
- if you are a young adult.
Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal
behaviour in young adults (aged less than 25 years) with psychiatric conditions who were being treated with an antidepressant.
If you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away.
You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed and ask them to read this leaflet.
You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
You should not take Thymanax together with certain medicines (see also under “ Do not take Thymanax ” in section 2): fluvoxamine (another medicine used in the treatment of depression), ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic).
Taking Thymanax with food and drink Thymanax can be taken with or without food.
It is not advisable to drink alcohol while you are being treated with Thymanax.
Pregnancy Talk to your doctor if you become pregnant (or plan to become pregnant) while you are taking Thymanax.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Breast-feeding Talk to your doctor if you are breast-feeding or intending to breast-feed as breastfeeding should be discontinued if you take Thymanax.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines You might experience dizziness or sleepiness which could affect your ability to drive or operate machinery.
Make sure that your reactions are normal before driving or operating machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Thymanax
20 This medicine contains lactose.
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking Thymanax.
3.
HOW TO TAKE THYMANAX
Always take Thymanax exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
The recommended dose of Thymanax is one tablet (25 mg) at bedtime.
In some cases, your doctor may prescribe a higher dose (50 mg), i. e. two tablets to be taken together at bedtime.
Thymanax starts to act on symptoms of depression in most depressed people within two weeks of starting treatment.
Your doctor may continue to give you Thymanax when you are feeling better to prevent your depression from returning.
