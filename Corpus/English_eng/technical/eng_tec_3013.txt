(PHP 3, PHP 4)
getallheaders() is an alias for apache_request_headers().
It will return an associative array of all the HTTP headers in the current request.
Please read the apache_request_headers() documentation for more information on how this function works.
Note:
In PHP 4.3.0, getallheaders() became an alias for apache_request_headers().
Essentially, it was renamed.
This is because this function only works when PHP is compiled as an Apache Module.
See also apache_request_headers().
