Tools
File Info
The view displays some information about the current file, including its type, the location of storage and the size.
Binary Filter
The filter performs binary operations on the selected bytes. After choosing the operation (AND, OR, ROTATE..) the parameters, if any, can be set in the box below. The filter is executed on the use of the Filter button.
Strings
This tool locates the strings in the selected bytes. After choosing the minimum string length, the strings are grepped for on the use of the Update button. The list of the strings displayed can be narrowed by entering a filter term.
Byte Table
The table lists all possible byte values, both as character and numerical value.
The selected value can be inserted at the cursor position for a defined number of bytes. This can be achieved by using the Insert button or double-clicking the line in the table.
Statistics
The view displays a statistic for the selected bytes. The statistic gives the frequency of the occurrence of each byte value in the selection. It can be brought uptodate by using the Update button.
Decoding Table
The table displays the value of the byte or the bytes starting at the cursor, interpreted as common simple data types like Integer or Float.
