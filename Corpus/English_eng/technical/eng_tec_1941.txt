Direct Cursor On/Off
The direct cursor allows you to click in any blank area of a page to place text, images, tables, frames, and other objects.
If you place the direct cursor approximately in the middle between the left and the right margin of a page or a table cell, the text you insert will be centred.
Similarly, text is right-aligned when the direct cursor is placed on the right margin.
The AutoCorrect tool automatically removes empty paragraphs, tabs, and spaces that are inserted by the direct cursor.
If you want to use the direct cursor, you must disable the AutoCorrect tool.
The direct cursor sets tabs to position the cursor.
If you change the tabs later. the position of the text on the page may change as well.
