Do you want to create a videoindex file ?

If you want GIMP-GAP to create videoindex files automatically
when recommanded, whithout showing up this dialog again
then you should add the following line to
your gimprc file:
%s
WARNING:
random positioning is not possible for this video.
creating a video index is NOT recommanded
(would not work)
TIP:
creating a video index on this video is recommanded.
This will enable fast and random frame access.
but requires one initial full scann.
(this will take a while).
INFO:
native fast and exact random positioning works for this video.
video index is not required, and should be cancelled.

Generate Workpointfiles
From:
First processed frame
To:
Last processed frame
Num Workpoints:
Number of workpoints to be generated par processed frame
Num Outlinepoints:
Number of additional workpoints on the outline of opaque image area
Tween Steps:
TWEEN-STEPS attribute value to be written to the generated workpoint file. (Number of tweens to be inserted between 2 frames at tween morphprocessing)
Deform Radius:
AFFECT-RADIUS attribute value to be written to the generated workpoint file.
INTENSITY attribute value to be written to the generated workpoint file. value 0 turns off intensity desceding deformation, morph processing will use linear deform action inside the deform radius
Locate Move Radius:
Locate radius in pixels. The workpoint generation searches for corresponding points in the next frame within this radius
Locate Shaperadius in pixels. Defines shape size as area around workpoint to be compared when loacting corresponding coordinate in the next frame.
Edge Threshold:
Edge detection threshold. Workpoints are generated on detected edges. Edges are detected on pixels where color or opacity differs significant from the neighbor pixel.(e.g. more than the specified edge detection threshold).
Locate ColordiffEdge Threshold:
ON: overwrite existing workpointfiles.OFF: Skip workpoint generation or add new generated workpoints (see append checkbutton).

Create Tween Frames
Information:
This operation creates copies of all frames in the specified range
and the specifed number of tweens as additional tween frames
between all the processed frames in the specified subdirectory.
Provide workpointfiles (one per frame) for morphing based tween rendering
(this can be done with the Morph Workpoint Generator)
This operation requires more than one frame.
Number of Tweens:
Number of tweens to be inserted between 2 frames. Value 0 renderes missing frames (via morphing or fade) but does not create tweens where the next frame number is equal to the current processed frame number +1
Subdirectory:
Name of a (Sub)directoy to save copies of processed frames and generated tweens. Note that tweens are created via simple fade operations when no workpointfile for the processed frame is available. (individual workpointfiles per frame are refered by extension .morphpoints)
ON: overwrite existing frames.OFF: skip processing when target frame/tween already exists.

Do not merge layers before save to the selected fileformat. Example: use this when converting to XCF that can handle transparency and multiple layers.
Flatten all resulting frames. Most fileformats can not handle multiple layers and need flattened frames (flattening does melt down all layers to one composite layer).Example: JPEG can not handle multiple layers and requires flattened frames.
Merge resulting frame down to one layer. This keeps transparency information Example: use this for PNG fileformat that can handle transpararency (alpha channel) but is limited to one layer)
Basename:
basename of the resulting frames. The number part and extension (000001.ext) is added automatically to all converted frames.
Extension:
The extension of resulting frames is also used to define the fileformat. Please note that fileformats differ in capabilities to store information for multiple layers and other things. Some fileformats may require converting to another imagetype and/or flattening the frames.

ffmpeg video encoding for anim frames. Menu: @FFMPEG@
This plugin does video encoding of animframes based on libavformat. (also known as FFMPEG encoder). The (optional) audiodata must be RIFF WAVEfmt (.wav) file. .wav files can be mono (1) or stereo (2channels) audiodata and must be 16bit uncompressed. IMPORTANT: Non-interactive callers should first call "

rawframes video encoding for anim frames. Menu: @rawframeS@
This plugin has a video encoder API but writes a series of single raw frames instead of one videofile. the filetype of the output frames is derived from the extension. the extension is the suffix part of the parameter "videofile". the names of the output frame(s) are same as the parameter "videofile" but the framenumber part is replaced by the current framenumber (or added automatic if videofile has no number part) audiodata is ignored.WARNINGS: for proper operation, the handled frames shall refere to single video file without any transitions. this allows fetching frames as raw data chunks. The chunks are 1:1 written to disc as framefiles. The resulting raw data frames on disc may be unusable if the raw chunk data is not compatible to any image fileformat. MPEG I frames, and MJPG files may be extractable to the JPEG fileformat. A call of"
