It is recommended that you choose the option to Open Separate Program, which will give you a whole lot more options and better interface when playing multimedia compared to an embedded KPart. However, when an object is embedded into a web page, & konqueror; has no choice but to use the KPart. In that situation the best thing is to right click the multimedia object and select the Start & kplayer; command described below.
Following is a complete list of user interface elements that & kplayer; 's KPart provides whenever possible. However, when the KPart is embedded into a web page, only the right click popup menu will be available.

Play, Pause, Stop, Forward, Fast Forward, Backward, Fast Backward and Back to Start commands from the Player menu of the full & kplayer;;
Decrease Volume, Increase Volume and Mute commands from the Audio submenu of the Player menu of the full & kplayer;;
Maintain Aspect command from the general popup menu of the full & kplayer;;
Properties command from the File menu of the full & kplayer;;
Start & kplayer; command from the KPart popup menu described below.
Main toolbar

The popup menu also contains Play, Pause, Stop, Maintain Aspect and Properties commands which as the same as the ones on the general popup menu in the full & kplayer;.
Mouse wheel
The action of the mouse wheel in & kplayer; depends on where the mouse cursor is positioned.
If the cursor is positioned over a slider, rolling the mouse wheel will change the setting that the slider controls, like playback position, sound volume, video contrast and so on. Rolling the wheel up (away from you) increases the setting, while rolling it down (towards you) decreases it. You can hold down the & Ctrl; key on the keyboard when rolling the wheel to change the setting faster.
Rolling the wheel when the mouse pointer is positioned over a window that has a scroll bar, like the multimedia library or the message log, will scroll the window up or down. Rolling the wheel over the playlist combo box will likewise scroll it up or down, switch to a different entry and start playing it.
When the mouse pointer is in the video area, rolling the wheel up (away from you) will zoom in, that is, enlarge the video area, and rolling the wheel down (towards you) will zoom out, or reduce the video area. However, if & kplayer; cannot resize the video area, for example when the window is full screen or maximized, it will instead seek, or move the playback point, forward when rolling the wheel up (away from you) or backward when rolling it down (towards you). In that case you can also hold down the & Ctrl; key on the keyboard to seek faster.
