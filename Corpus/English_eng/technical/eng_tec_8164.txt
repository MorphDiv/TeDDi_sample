PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Solution for injection.
Clear, colourless to light amber solution with pH ranging between 7.0 and 8.5.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
QUADRAMET is indicated for the relief of bone pain in patients with multiple painful osteoblastic skeletal metastases which take up technetium [99mTc]-labelled biphosphonates on bone scan.
The presence of osteoblastic metastases which take up technetium [99mTc]-labelled biphosphonates should be confirmed prior to therapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
QUADRAMET should only be administered by physicians experienced in the use of radiopharmaceuticals and after full oncological evaluation of the patient by qualified physicians.
The recommended dose of QUADRAMET is 37 MBq per kg body weight and is to be administered by slow intravenous route through an established intravenous line over a period of one minute.
QUADRAMET should not be diluted before use.
2 Patients who respond to QUADRAMET generally experience the onset of pain relief within 1 week after treatment.
Relief of pain may persist for 4 weeks up to 4 months.
Patients who experience a reduction in pain may be encouraged to decrease their use of opioid analgesics.
Repeat administration of QUADRAMET should be based on an individual patient's response to prior treatment and on clinical symptoms.
A minimum interval of 8 weeks should be respected, subject to recovery of adequate bone marrow function.
The data on the safety of repeated dosing are limited and based on compassionate use of the product.
QUADRAMET is not recommended for use in children below the age of 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contra-indications
QUADRAMET is contra-indicated: • Hypersensitivity to the active substance (ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate (EDTMP) or similar phosphonates) or to any of the excipients. • in pregnant women (See section 4.6). • in patients having received chemotherapy or hemi-body external radiation therapy in a preceding period of 6 weeks.
QUADRAMET is used only as a palliative agent and should not be used concurrently with myelotoxic chemotherapy as this may enhance myelotoxicity.
It should not be used concurrently with other biphosphonates if an interference is shown on the technetium [99mTc]-labelled biphosphonate bone scans.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In absence of clinical data, the injected activity should be adapted to the renal function.
Use of QUADRAMET in patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve from previous therapy or disease involvement is not recommended unless the potential benefit of the treatment outweighs its risks.
Because of potential bone marrow suppression after administration, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 8 weeks, beginning 2 weeks after administration of QUADRAMET, or until recovery of adequate bone marrow function.
The patient should be encouraged to ingest (or receive by intravenous administration) a minimum of 500 ml of fluids prior to injection and should be encouraged to void as often as possible after injection to minimise radiation exposure to the bladder.
The clearance of QUADRAMET being rapid, the precautions relating to the excreted urinary radioactivity need not be taken after 6-12 hours following administration.
Special precautions, such as bladder catheterisation, should be taken during six hours following administration to incontinent patients to minimise the risk of radioactive contamination of clothing, bed linen, and the patient's environment.
For the other patients the urine should be collected for at least six (6) hours.
Bladder catheterisation should be undertaken in patients with urinary obstruction.
3 Radiopharmaceuticals may be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings.
Its receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and the appropriate licences of the local competent official organisations.
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements.
Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, complying with the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice for pharmaceuticals.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Because of the potential for additive effects on bone marrow, the treatment should not be given concurrently with chemotherapy or external beam radiation therapy.
QUADRAMET may be given subsequent to either of these treatments after allowing for adequate marrow recovery.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
QUADRAMET is contra-indicated(see 4.3) in pregnancy.
The possibility of pregnancy must strictly be ruled out.
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during the treatment and the whole period of follow-up.
There are no available clinical data relating to the excretion of QUADRAMET in human milk.
If therefore QUADRAMET administration is deemed necessary, formula feeding should be substituted for breast-feeding and the expressed feeds discarded.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Decreases in white blood cell and platelet counts and anaemia were observed in patients receiving QUADRAMET.
In clinical trials white blood cell and platelet counts decreased to a nadir of approximately 40% to 50% of baseline 3 to 5 weeks after a dose, and generally returned to pre-treatment levels by 8 weeks post treatment.
The few patients who experienced Grade 3 or 4 hematopoietic toxicity usually either had a history of recent external beam radiation therapy or chemotherapy or had rapidly progressive disease with probable bone marrow involvement.
Postmarketing reports of thrombocytopenia have included isolated reports of intracranial haemorrhage, and cases in which the outcome was fatal.
A small number of patients have reported a transient increase in bone pain shortly after injection (flare reaction).
This is usually mild and self-limiting and occurs within 72 hours of injection.
Such reactions are usually responsive to analgesics.
Adverse drug reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and sweating were reported.
Hypersensitivity reactions including rare cases of anaphylactic reaction have been reported after QUADRAMET administration.
A few patients experienced cord/ root compressions, disseminated intravascular coagulation and cerebrovascular accidents.
The occurrence of these events may be linked to the patients’ disease evolution.
When there are spinal metastases at the cervico-dorsal level, an increased risk of spinal cord compression cannot be excluded.
4 The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations.
In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease itself.
4.9 Overdose
The product should only be administered by qualified personnel in authorised settings.
The possibility of pharmacological overdose is therefore remote.
The risks to be expected are associated with the inadvertent administration of excess radioactivity.
Radiation dose to the body can be limited by promoting a diuresis and frequent voiding of urine.
5.
PHARMACOLOGIC PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Various pain palliation radiopharmaceuticals.
ATC Code:
V10BX02
QUADRAMET has an affinity for skeletal tissue and concentrates in areas of bone turnover in intimate association with hydroxyapatite; studies in rats have demonstrated that QUADRAMET is cleared rapidly from the blood and localises to growing areas of bone matrix, specifically the layer of osteoid undergoing mineralisation.
In clinical studies employing planar imaging techniques, QUADRAMET accumulates with a lesion- to-normal bone ratio of approximately 5 and a lesion-to-soft tissue ratio of approximately 6.
Thus, areas of metastatic involvement can accumulate significantly greater amounts of QUADRAMET than surrounding normal bone.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
In patients, QUADRAMET is rapidly cleared from the blood.
Thirty minutes after injection of the agent to 22 patients, only 9.6 ± 2.8% of the administered activity remained in plasma.
At 4 and 24 hours, plasma radioactivity had decreased from 1.3 ± 0.7% to 0.05 ± 0.03%.
Urinary excretion occurred predominantly during the first 4 hours (30.3 ± 13.5%).
At 12 hours, 35.3 ± 13.6% of the administered activity had been excreted into the urine.
Analysis of urine samples found the radioactivity to be present as the intact complex.
Less urinary excretion occurred in patients who had extensive bony metastases, regardless of the amount of radiopharmaceutical administered.
Total skeletal uptake of QUADRAMET in studies of 453 patients with a variety of primary malignancies was 65.5 ± 15.5% of the administered activity.
A positive correlation was found between skeletal uptake and the number of metastatic sites.
In contrast, skeletal uptake was inversely proportional to plasma radioactivity at 30 minutes.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The radiolysis products of Sm-EDTMP showed a renal toxicity in rats and dogs with a no effect level of 2.5 mg/ kg.
Repeated dose administration of samarium [153Sm]-EDTMP to dogs indicated a slightly longer time for depressed bone marrow and peripheral haematological parameters to recover when compared to recovery following only single dose administration.
Radioactive Sm-EDTMP has not been tested for mutagenicity/ carcinogenicity but due to the radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure it should be regarded as presenting a genotoxic/ carcinogenic risk.
5 Non-radioactive Sm-EDTMP showed no mutagenic potential in a battery of in vivo and in vitro tests.
The same results were observed for Sm-EDTMP enriched with radiolysis degradants.
In a carcinogenic potential study of EDTMP, osteosarcomas occurred in rats at high doses.
In the absence of genotoxic properties, these effects can be assigned to the EDTMP chelatant properties leading to osseous metabolism disturbances.
No studies have been performed to assess the effect of QUADRAMET on reproduction.

DOSIMETRY
The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average adult patient from an intravenous injection of QUADRAMET are shown in Table 2.
The dosimetry estimates were based on clinical biodistribution studies using methods developed for radiation dose calculations by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine.
Because QUADRAMET is excreted in the urine, radiation exposure was based on a urinary voiding interval of 4.8 hours.
Radiation dose estimates for bone and marrow assume that radioactivity is deposited on bone surfaces, in accordance with autoradiograms of bone samples taken from patients who received QUADRAMET.
7 Radiation dose to specific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy, may be influenced significantly by pathophysiological changes induced by the disease process.
This should be taken into consideration when using the following information:
TABLE 2:
RADIATION ABSORBED DOSES Organ Adrenals Brain Chest Gallbladder Ascending colon wall Descending colon wall Small intestine Myocardial wall Kidneys Liver Lungs Muscle Ovaries Pancreas Red marrow Bone surfaces Skin Spleen Stomach Testes Thymus Thyroid Urinary bladder wall Uterus Effective dose (mSv/ MBq)
Absorbed dose per injected activity (mGy/ MBq) 0.009 0.011 0.003 0.004 0.005 0.010 0.006 0.005 0.018 0.005 0.008 0.007 0.008 0.005 1.54 6.76 0.004 0.004 0.004 0.005 0.004 0.007 0.973 0.011 0.307
For this product the effective dose resulting from an injected activity of 2 590 MBq is 796 mSv.
For an administered activity of 2 590 MBq, the typical radiation dose to the target organ, skeletal metastases, is 86.5 Gy and the typical radiation doses to the critical organs are: normal bone surfaces 17.5 Gy, red marrow 4.0 Gy, urinary bladder wall 2.5 Gy, kidneys 0.047 Gy and ovaries 0.021 Gy.

Further information
1.
WHAT QUADRAMET IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
QUADRAMET is a medicinal product for therapeutic use only.
This radiopharmaceutical is used for the treatment of bone pain due to your disease.
QUADRAMET has a high affinity for skeletal tissue.
Once injected it concentrates in bone lesions.
Because QUADRAMET contains small amounts of a radioactive element, samarium-153, radiations are delivered locally to the bone lesions, allowing to develop the palliative action on bone pain.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE QUADRAMET
Do not take QUADRAMET:
• If you are hypersensitive (allergic) to ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMP) or similar phosphonate compounds, • If you are pregnant, • If you have received chemotherapy or hemibody field external radiation therapy in a preceding period of 6 weeks.
Take special care with QUADRAMET:
QUADRAMET is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age.
Your doctor will take blood samples weekly for at least 8 weeks to check your platelets, white and red blood cell counts which may slightly decrease due to the therapy.
During 6 hours following the injection of QUADRAMET, your physician will encourage you to drink and void as often as possible.
He will decide at which time you will be authorised to leave the nuclear medicine department.
18 In the case of urine incontinence or urinary obstruction you will get a urine catheter for about 6 hours.
For the other patients the urine should be collected for at least 6 hours.
If your renal function is decreased, the amount of product will be adapted.
Taking other medicines:
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding:
QUADRAMET must not be administered to pregnant women.
If QUADRAMET administration to a breastfeeding woman is deemed necessary, breastfeeding should be stopped.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
3.
HOW TO TAKE QUADRAMET
Your doctor will want to carry out a special scan before administering QUADRAMET to ascertain whether you are likely to benefit from QUADRAMET.
Dosage
One single dose of 37 megabecquerel (Becquerel is the unit in which radioactivity is measured) of QUADRAMET per kilogram of body weight is to be injected.
If you have the impression that the effect of QUADRAMET is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Method and route of administration
QUADRAMET is to be administered by slow injection into a vein.
Frequency of administration
This medicinal product is not intended to be injected on a regular or continuous basis.
The administration can however be repeated after 8 weeks following injection, subject to the evolution of your disease.
Duration of treatment
You will be authorised to leave the nuclear medicine department after a dosimetric follow-up (generally within 6 hours following QUADRAMET injection).
If you take more QUADRAMET than you should
QUADRAMET being supplied as a single-dose vial, an accidental overdose is unlikely to occur.
Radiation dose to the body can be limited by increasing fluid intake and frequent voiding of urine.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
19 4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, QUADRAMET can have side effects, although not everybody gets them.
The undesirable effects due to QUADRAMET administration are linked with a decrease of red and white blood cells, and platelets.
Cases of bleeding have been reported, some of which have been serious.
This is the reason why your blood counts will be monitored strictly for a few weeks following QUADRAMET injection.
You may exceptionally feel a slight increase in bone pain a few days after QUADRAMET injection.
You should not be alarmed at this; in such case, your pain medicine will be slightly increased.
This effect is moderate and brief and will disappear after some hours.
Adverse drug reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and sweating were reported.
Hypersensitivity reactions including rare cases of anaphylactic reaction have been reported after QUADRAMET administration.
In rare cases, the following undesirable effects have been observed: neuralgia, coagulation disorders, cerebrovascular accidents.
These effects were deemed to be related to the progression of the disease.
If you experience back pain or sensory abnormalities, please inform your physician as soon as possible.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
5.
HOW TO STORE QUADRAMET
