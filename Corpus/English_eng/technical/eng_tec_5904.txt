adddebug
1
Modifies Makefile (s) to add debug info
adddebug -k -r -n
Description
adddebug modifies the Makefile in the current directory (and optionally in its subdirectories) to add debug info (-g3). It will also remove optimisations (-O[1-9]).
This utility is part of the & kde; Software Development Kit.
Options
-k
Keep optimisations (do not remove -O[1-9]? flags which are removed by default).
-r
Recursively search through all subdirectories of the current directory and operate on every Makefile that is found.
-n
compile without NDEBUG and NO_DEBUG being defined (makes kDebug calls work)
