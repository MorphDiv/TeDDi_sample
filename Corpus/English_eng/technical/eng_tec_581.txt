Edit Points Bar
Edit Points
Bar appears when you select a polygon object and click
Edit Points
.
The functions provided allow you to edit the points of a curve or an object converted to a curve.
The following icons are available:
Edit Points
Edit Points
icon allows you to activate or deactivate the edit mode for Bézier objects.
In the edit mode, individual points of the drawing object can be selected.
Icon
Edit Points
Move Points
Activates a mode in which you can move points.
The mouse pointer displays a small empty square when resting on a point.
Drag that point to another location.
The curve on both sides of the point follows the movement; the section of the curve between the next points changes shape.
Point at the curve between two points or within a closed curve and drag the mouse to shift the entire curve without distorting the form.
Icon
Move Points
Insert Points
Activates the insert mode.
This mode allows you to insert points.
You can also move points, just as in the move mode.
If, however, you click at the curve between two points and move the mouse a little while holding down the mouse button you insert a new point.
The point is a smooth point, and the lines to the control points are parallel and remain so when moved.
Corner Point

Insert Points
Delete Points
Delete Points
icon to delete one or several selected points.
If you wish to select several points click the appropriate points while holding down the Shift key.
First select the points to be deleted, and then click this icon, or press Del.
Icon

Split Curve
Split Curve
icon splits a curve.
Select the point or points where you want to split the curve, then click the icon
.
Icon
Split Curve
Convert To Curve
Converts a curve into a straight line or converts a straight line into a curve.
If you select a single point, the curve before the point will be converted.
If two points are selected, the curve between both points will be converted.
If you select more than two points, each time you click this icon, a different portion of the curve will be converted.
If necessary, round points are converted into corner points and corner points are converted into round points.
If a certain section of the curve is straight, the end points of the line have a maximum of one control point each.
They cannot be modified to round points unless the straight line is converted back to a curve.
Icon
Convert To Curve
Corner Point
Converts the selected point or points into corner points.
Corner points have two movable control points, which are independent from each other.
A curved line, therefore, does not go straight through a corner point, but forms a corner.
Icon
Corner Point
Smooth Transition
Converts a corner point or symmetrical point into a smooth point.
Both control points of the corner point are aligned in parallel, and can only be moved simultaneously.
The control points may differentiate in length, allowing you to vary the degree of curvature.
Icon
Smooth Transition
Symmetric Transition
This icon converts a corner point or a smooth point into a symmetrical point.
Both control points of the corner point are aligned in parallel and have the same length.
They can only be moved simultaneously and the degree of curvature is the same in both directions.
Icon
Symmetric Transition
Close Bézier
Closes a line or a curve.
A line is closed by connecting the last point with the first point, indicated by an enlarged square.
Icon
Close Bézier
Eliminate Points
Marks the current point or the selected points for deletion.
This happens in the event that the point is located on a straight line.
If you convert a curve or a polygon with the
Convert to Curve
icon into a straight line or you change a curve with the mouse so that a point lies on the straight line, it is removed.
The angle from which the point reduction is to take place

is 15° by default.
