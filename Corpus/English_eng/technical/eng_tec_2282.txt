Configuration
Next
When using PHP as an Apache module, you can also change the configuration settings using directives in Apache configuration files (e.g. httpd.conf) and .htaccess files (You will need "AllowOverride Options "or "AllowOverride All" privileges)
With PHP 4.0, there are several Apache directives that allow you to change the PHP configuration from within the Apache configuration files.
For a listing of which directives are PHP_INI_ALL, PHP_INI_PERDIR, or PHP_INI_SYSTEM, have a look at the table found within the ini_set() documentation.
Note:
With PHP 3.0, there are Apache directives that correspond to each configuration setting in the php3.ini name, except the name is prefixed by "php3_".
Sets the value of the specified directive.
Can be used only with PHP_INI_ALL and PHP_INI_PERDIR type directives.
To clear a previously set value use none as the value.
php_value auto_prepend_file none
Used to set a Boolean configuration directive.
Can be used only with PHP_INI_ALL and PHP_INI_PERDIR type directives.
Sets the value of the specified directive.
This can NOT be used in .htaccess files.
Any directive type set with php_admin_value can not be overridden by .htaccess or virtualhost directives.
Used to set a Boolean configuration directive.
This can NOT be used in .htaccess files.
Any directive type set with php_admin_flag can not be overridden by .htaccess or virtualhost directives.
Example 4-2.
Apache configuration example
IfModule mod_php4.c php_value include_path ".: / usr / local / lib / php" php_admin_flag safe_mode on / IfModule IfModule mod_php3.c php3_include_path ".: / usr / local / lib / php "php3_safe_mode on / IfModule
Note:
PHP constants do not exist outside of PHP.
For example, in httpd.conf you can not use PHP constants such as E_ALL or E_NOTICE to set the error_reporting directive as they will have no meaning and will evaluate to 0.
Use the associated bitmask values instead.
These constants can be used in php.ini
Regardless of the interface to PHP you can change certain values at runtime of your scripts through ini_set().
The following table provides an overview at which level a directive can be set / changed.
Table 4-1.
