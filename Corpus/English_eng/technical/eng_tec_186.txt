Statistical Functions Part Three
LARGE function
LARGE
Returns the Rank_c-th largest value in a data set.
Syntax:
LARGE(Data; RankC)
Data
is the cell range of data.
RankC
is the ranking of the value.
Example:
=LARGE(A1:C50; 2)
gives the second largest value in A1:C50.
SMALL function
SMALL
Returns the Rank_c-th smallest value in a data set.
Syntax:
SMALL(Data; RankC)
Data
is the cell range of data.
RankC
is the rank of the value.
Example:
=SMALL(A1:C50; 2)
gives the second smallest value in A1:C50.
CONFIDENCE function
CONFIDENCE
Returns the (1-alpha) confidence interval for a normal distribution.
Syntax:
CONFIDENCE(Alpha; StDev; Size)
Alpha
is the level of the confidence interval.
StDev
is the standard deviation for the total population.
Size
is the size of the total population.
Example:
=CONFIDENCE(0.05; 1.5; 100)
gives 0.29.
CORREL function
coefficient of correlation
mw added one entry
CORREL
Returns the correlation coefficient between two data sets.
Syntax:
CORREL(Data1; Data2)
Data1
is the first data set.
Data2
is the second data set.
Example:
=CORREL(A1:A50; B1:B50)
calculates the correlation coefficient as a measure of the linear correlation of the two data sets.
COVAR function
COVAR
Returns the covariance of the product of paired deviations.
Syntax:
COVAR(Data1; Data2)
Data1
is the first data set.
Data2
is the second data set.
Example:
=COVAR(A1:A30; B1:B30)
CRITBINOM function
CRITBINOM
Returns the smallest value for which the cumulative binomial distribution is less than or equal to a criterion value.
Syntax:
CRITBINOM(Trials; SP; Alpha)
Trials
is the total number of trials.
SP
is the probability of success for one trial.
Alpha
is the threshold probability to be reached or exceeded.
Example:
=CRITBINOM(100; 0.5; 0.1)
yields 44.
KURT function
KURT
Returns the kurtosis of a data set (at least 4 values required).
Syntax:
KURT(Number1; Number2; ...
Number30)
Number1; Number2; ...
Number30
are 1 to 30 numerical arguments or ranges representing a random sample of distribution.
Example:
=KURT(A1; A2; A3; A4; A5; A6)
LOGINV function
inverse of log-normal distribution
mw added one entry
LOGINV
Returns the inverse of the log-normal distribution.
Syntax:
LOGINV(Number; Mean; StDev)
Number
is the probability value for which the inverse standard logarithmic distribution is to be calculated.
Mean
is the arithmetic mean of the standard logarithmic distribution.
StDev
is the standard deviation of the standard logarithmic distribution.
Example:
=LOGINV(0.05; 0; 1)
returns 0.19.
LOGNORMDIST function
cumulative log-normal distribution
mw added one entry
LOGNORMDIST
Returns the cumulative log-normal distribution.
Syntax:
LOGNORMDIST(Number; Mean; StDev; Cumulative)
Number
is the probability value for which the standard logarithmic distribution is to be calculated.
Mean
(optional)is the mean value of the standard logarithmic distribution.
StDev
(optional) is the standard deviation of the standard logarithmic distribution.
Cumulative
(optional) = 0 calculates the density function, Cumulative = 1 calculates the distribution.
Example:
=LOGNORMDIST(0.1; 0; 1)
returns 0.01.
