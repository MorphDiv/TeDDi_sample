(PHP 3 = 3.0.1, PHP 4)
pg_fetch_array() returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row (tuples / records).
It returns FALSE, if there are no more rows.
pg_fetch_array() is an extended version of pg_fetch_row().
In addition to storing the data in the numeric indices (field index) to the result array, it also stores the data in associative indices (field name) by default.
row is row (record) number to be retrieved.
First row is 0.
result_type is optional parameter controls how return value is initialized. result_type is a constant and can take the following values:
PGSQL_ASSOC, PGSQL_NUM, and PGSQL_BOTH. pg_fetch_array() PGSQL_ASSOC, PGSQL_NUM, and PGSQL_BOTH. pg_fetch_array() returns associative array that has field name as key for PGSQL_ASSOC. field index as key with PGSQL_NUM and both field name / index as key with PGSQL_BOTH.
Default is PGSQL_BOTH.
pg_fetch_array() is NOT significantly slower than using pg_fetch_row(), while it provides a significant ease of use.
See also pg_fetch_row() and pg_fetch_object() and pg_fetch_result().
Example 1.
PostgreSQL fetch array
?php $conn = pg_pconnect ("dbname=publisher"); if (!$conn) {echo "An error occured.\n"; exit;} $result = pg_query ($conn, "SELECT * FROM authors"); if (!$result) {echo "An error occured.\n"; exit;} $arr = pg_fetch_array ($result, 0, PGSQL_NUM); echo $arr[0]. "- array\n"; $arr = pg_fetch_array ($result, 1, PGSQL_ASSOC); echo $arr["author"]." - array\n";?
Note:
From 4.1.0, row became optional.
Calling pg_fetch_array() will increment internal row counter by 1.
