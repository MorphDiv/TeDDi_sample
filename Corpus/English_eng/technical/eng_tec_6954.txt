Undoing
Undo
Almost anything you do to an image in
Undoing can itself be undone. After having undone an action, you can
If you undo one or more actions and then operate on the image in any way except by using Undo or Redo, it will no longer be possible to redo those actions: they are lost forever. The solution to this, if it creates a problem for you, is to duplicate the image and then test on the copy. ( Do
If you often find yourself undoing and redoing many steps at a time, it may be more convenient to work with the
Undo is performed on an image-specific basis: the "Undo History" is one of the components of an image.
Even though the Undo History is a component of an image, it is not saved when you save the image using

Things That Cannot be Undone
Most actions that alter an image can be undone. Actions that do not alter the image generally cannot be undone. Examples include saving the image to a file, duplicating the image, copying part of the image to the clipboard, etc. It also includes most actions that affect the image display without altering the underlying image data. The most important example is zooming. There are, however, exceptions: toggling QuickMask on or off can be undone, even though it does not alter the image data.
There are a few important actions that do alter an image but cannot be undone:
Closing the image
The Undo History is a component of the image, so when the image is closed and all of its resources are freed, the Undo History is gone. Because of this, unless the image has not been modified since the last time it was saved,
Reverting the image


Some tools require you to perform a complex series of manipulations before they take effect, but only allow you to undo the whole thing rather than the individual elements. For example, the Intelligent Scissors require you to create a closed path by clicking at multiple points in the image, and then clicking inside the path to create a selection. You cannot undo the individual clicks: undoing after you are finished takes you all the way back to the starting point. For another example, when you are working with the Text tool, you cannot undo individual letters, font changes, etc.: undoing after you are finished removes the newly created text layer.
Filters, and other actions performed by plugins or scripts, can be undone just like actions implemented by the

Text Management
Text
Editing text
Text is managed with the Text tool. This tool creates a new layer containing the text, above the current layer in the layer dialog, with the size of the text box. Its name is the beginning of the text.

Managing Text Layer
You can operate on a text layer in the same ways as any other layer, but doing so often means giving up the ability to edit the text without losing the results of your work.
To understand some of the idiosyncrasies of text handling, it may help for you to realize that a text layer contains more information than the pixel data that you see: it also contains a representation of the text in a text-editor format. You can see this in the text-editor window that pops up while you are using the Text tool. Every time you alter the text, the image layer is redrawn to reflect your changes.
Now suppose you create a text layer, and then operate on it in some way that does not involve the Text tool: rotate it, for example. Suppose you then come back and try to edit it using the Text tool. As soon as you edit the text, the Text tool will redraw the layer, wiping out the results of the operations you performed in the meantime.
Because this danger is not obvious, the Text tool tries to protect you from it. If you operate on a text layer, and then later try to edit the text, a message pops up, warning you that your alterations will be undone, and giving you three options:
edit the text anyway;
cancel;
create a new text layer with the same text as the existing layer, leaving the existing layer unchanged.

The Selection
Selections
Concepts
Often when you operate on an image, you only want part of it to be affected. In
How would you isolate the tree?
There are many, many situations where creating just the right selection is the key to getting the result you want, and often it is not easy to do. For example, in the above image, suppose I want to cut the tree out from its background, and paste it into a different image. To do this, I need to create a selection that contains the tree and nothing but the tree. It is difficult because the tree has a complex shape, and in several spots is hard to distinguish from the objects behind it.
Selection shown as usual with dashed line.
Now here is a very important point, and it is crucial to understand this. Ordinarily when you create a selection, you see it as a dashed line enclosing a portion of the image. The common, not entirely accurate, idea you could get from this, is that the selection is a sort of container, with the selected parts of the image inside, and the unselected parts outside. Although this concept of selection is okay for many purposes, it is not entirely correct.
Actually the selection is implemented as a
What, then, is the dashed line that appears when you create a selection?
The dashed line is a
Same selection in QuickMask mode.
While looking at the dashed line that represents the selection, always remember that the line tells only part of the story. If you want to see the selection in complete detail, the easiest way is to click the QuickMask button in the lower left corner of the image window. This causes the selection to be shown as a translucent overlay atop the image. Selected areas are unaffected; unselected areas are reddened. The more completely selected an area is, the less red it appears.
Many operations work differently in QuickMask mode, as mentioned in the
Same selection in QuickMask mode after feathering.
Feathering
With the default settings, the basic selection tools, such as the Rectangle Select tool, create sharp selections. Pixels inside the dashed line are fully selected, and pixels outside completely unselected. You can verify this by toggling QuickMask: you see a clear rectangle with sharp edges, surrounded by uniform red. Use the
If you are following along, try this with the Rectangle Select tool, and then toggle QuickMask. You will see that the clear rectangle has a fuzzy edge.
Feathering is particularly useful when you are cutting and pasting, so that the pasted object blends smoothly and unobtrusively with its surroundings.
It is possible to feather a selection at any time, even if it was originally created as a sharp selection. Use
For technically oriented readers: feathering works by applying a Gaussian blur to the selection channel, with the specified blurring radius.
Making a Selection Partially Transparent
You can set layer opacity, but you cannot do that directly for a selection. It is quite useful to make the image of a glass transparent. Use the following methods to set the layer opacity:
For simple selections, use the Eraser tool with the desired opacity.

There are two kinds of Script-Fus:

Image-dependent Script-Fus
Menus have been reorganized. A new Colors-menu appears. It groups together all scripts that work on colors, for example tools that adjust hue, saturation, lightness..., filters...etc. Filters-menu and Script-Fu-menu are merged in one Filters-menu and it is organized according to new categories. Image-dependent Plug-ins and Script-Fus are now disseminated in the image-menus. For example, Color to Alpha filter is in Colors-menu. At the beginning, it's disconcerting, but you finish to get used to this because it's more logical.

We will not try to describe every script in depth. Most Script-Fus are very easy to understand and use. At the time of this writing, the following types are installed by default:
Web page themes
Logos
Buttons
You will find all kinds of pattern-generating scripts here. Generally, they are quite useful because you can add many arguments to your own patterns.
We'll take a look at the Land script. In this script you have to set the image/pattern size, and specify what levels of random to use for your land creation. The colors used to generate the land map are taken from the currently selected gradient in the gradient editor. You must also supply values for the level of detail, land and sea height/depth and the scale. Scale refers to the scale of your map, just as in an ordinary road map, 1:10 will be typed as 10.
Web Page Themes
Here is clearly a practical use for scripts. By creating a script for making custom text, logos, buttons arrows, etc., for your web site, you will give them all the same style and shape. You will also be saving a lot of time, because you don't have to create every logo, text or button by hand.
Most of the scripts are quite self-explanatory, but here are some hints:
Leave all strange characters like ' and " intact.
Make sure that the pattern specified in the script exists.
Padding refers to the amount of space around your text.
A high value for bevel width gives the illusion of a higher button.
If you type TRUE for "Press", the button will look pushed down.
Choose transparency if you don't want a solid background. If you choose a solid background, make sure it is the same color as the web page background.
Logo
Here you will find all kinds of logo-generating scripts. This is nice, but use it with care, as people might recognize your logo as being made by a known
In the Text String field, type your logo name, like Frozenriver.
In the Font Size text field, type the size of your logo in pixels.
In the Font text field, type the name of the font that you want to use for your logo.

Under this headline you'll find two scripts that makes rectangular beveled buttons, with or without round corners (Round Button or Simple Beveled Button).

In QuickMask mode, the selection is shown as a translucent screen overlying the image, whose transparency at each pixel indicates the degree to which that pixel is selected. By default the mask is shown in red, but you can change this if another mask color is more convenient. The less a pixel is selected, the more it is obscured by the mask. Fully selected pixels are shown completely clear.
In QuickMask mode, many image manipulations act on the selection channel rather than the image itself. This includes, in particular, paint tools.

Layer Properties
Each layer in an image has a number of important attributes:
Name

Presence or absence of an alpha channel
Background layer
Transparency
Background layer transparency
An alpha channel encodes information about how transparent a layer is at each pixel. It is visible in the Channel Dialog: white is complete opacity, black is complete transparency and grey levels are partial transparencies.
The background layer is particular. If you have just created a new image, it has still only one layer which is a background layer. If the image has been created with an opaque Fill type, this one layer has no Alpha channel. If you add a new layer, even with an opaque Fill type, an Alpha channel is automatically created, which applies to all layers apart from the background layer. To get a background layer with transparency, either you create your new image with a transparent Fill type, or you use the
Every layer other than the bottom layer of an image has automatically an Alpha channel, but you can't see a grayscale representation of the alpha values. See
Example for Alpha channel
Alpha Channel
Alpha channel example: Basic image
This image has three layers painted with pure 100% opaque Red, Green, and Blue. In the Channel Dialog, you can see that an alpha Channel has been added. It is white because the image is not transparent since there is at least one 100% opaque layer. The current layer is the red one : since it is painted with pure red, there is no green and no blue and the corresponding channels are black.
Alpha channel example: One transparent layer
The left part of the first layer has been made transparent (Rectangular selection, Edit/Clear). The second layer, green, is visible. The Alpha channel is still white, since there is an opaque layer in this part of the image.
Alpha channel example: Two transparent layers
The left part of the second layer has been made transparent. The third layer, blue, is visible through the first and second layers. The Alpha channel is still white, since there is an opaque layer in this part of the image.
Alpha channel example: Three transparent layers
The left part of the third layer has been made transparent. The Alpha channel is still white and the left part of the layer is white, opaque! The background layer has no Alpha channel. In this case, the Clear command works like the Eraser and uses the Background color of Toolbox.

The amount of memory that a layer consumes is determined by its dimensions, not its contents. So, if you are working with large images or images that contain many layers, it might pay off to trim layers to the minimum possible size.
Opacity
The opacity of a layer determines the extent to which it lets colors from layers beneath it in the stack show through. Opacity ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 meaning complete transparency, and 100 meaning complete opacity.
Mode
The Mode of a layer determines how colors from the layer are combined with colors from the underlying layers to produce a visible result. This is a sufficiently complex, and sufficiently important, concept to deserve a section of its own, which follows. See

There is a drop-down list in the Toolbox options box which contains modes that affect the painting tools in a similar way to the layer modes. You can use all of the same modes for painting that are available for layers, and there are two additional modes just for the painting tools. See
Layer modes permit complex color changes in the image. They are often used with a new layer which acts as a kind of mask. For example, if you put a solid white layer over an image and set the layer mode of the new layer to

In the descriptions of the layer modes below, the equations are also shown. This is for those who are curious about the mathematics of the layer modes. You do not need to understand the equations in order to use the layer modes effectively, however.
The equations are in a shorthand notation. For example, the equation
Example
$$E = M + I$$
means,
Unless the description below says otherwise, a negative color component is set to 0 and a color component larger than 255 is set to 255.
The examples below show the effects of each of the modes.
Since the results of each mode vary greatly depending upon the colors on the layers, these images can only give you a general idea of how the modes work. You are encouraged to try them out yourself. You might start with two similar layers, where one is a copy of the other, but slightly modified (by being blurred, moved, rotated, scaled, color-inverted, etc.) and seeing what happens with the layer modes.
Normal
Example for layer mode
Both images are blended into each other with the same intensity.

Example for layer mode
Mask 1 is used as upper layer with 100% opacity.
Mask 2 is used as upper layer with 100% opacity.

Equation for layer mode
$$E = \\frac{M \ imes I}{255}$$
The mode is commutative; the order of the two layers doesn't matter.
Divide
Example for layer mode

Equation for layer mode
$$E = \\frac{256 \ imes I}{M + 1}$$
Screen
Example for layer mode

Equation for layer mode
$$E = 255 - \\frac{(255-M)\ imes (255-I)}{255}$$

The equation is the *theoretical* equation. Due to
The equation is:
Equation for layer mode
$$E = \\frac{I}{255} \ imes \\left(I + \\frac{2\ imes M}{255} \ imes (255 - I)\\right)$$
Dodge
Example for layer mode

In photography, dodging is a technique used in a darkroom to decrease the exposure in particular areas of the image. This brings out details in the shadows. When used for this purpose, dodge may work best on Grayscale images and with a painting tool, rather than as a layer mode.
Equation for layer mode
$$E = \\frac{256\ imes I}{(255 - M) + 1}$$
Burn
Example for layer mode

In photography, burning is a technique used in a darkroom to increase the exposure in particular areas of the image. This brings out details in the highlights. When used for this purpose, burn may work best on Grayscale images and with a painting tool, rather than as a layer mode.
Equation for layer mode
$$E = 255 - \\frac{256\ imes(255 - I)}{M + 1}$$
Hard light
Example for layer mode

The equation is complex and different according to the value &gt;128 or &le; 128:
Equation for layer mode
$$E = 255 - \\frac{\\big(255 - 2\ imes (M-128)\\big)\ imes (255 - I)} {256}, \\qquad M &gt; 128$$
Equation for layer mode
$$E = \\frac{2 \ imes M \ imes I}{256}, \\qquad M \\le 128$$
Soft light
Example for layer mode

The equation is complicated. It needs Rs, the result of Screen mode :
$$R_{s} = 255 - \\frac{(255-M)\ imes(255-I)}{255}$$
Equation for layer mode
$$E = \\frac{(255-I)\ imes M + R_{s}}{255} \ imes I$$

Usually the fix is to convert the image to a different type, most commonly RGB.

Wilber, the GIMP mascot

If a simple image can be compared to a single sheet of paper, an image with layers is likened to a sheaf of transparent papers stacked one on top of the other. You can draw on each paper, but still see the content of the other sheets through the transparent areas. You can also move one sheet in relation to the others. Sophisticated
Resolution
Digital images comprise of a grid of square elements of varying colors, called pixels. Each image has a pixel size, such as 900 pixels wide by 600 pixels high. But pixels don't have a set size in physical space. To set up an image for printing, we use a value called resolution, defined as the ratio between an image's size in pixels and its physical size (usually in inches) when it is printed on paper. Most file formats (but not all) can save this value, which is expressed as ppi &mdash; pixels per inch. When printing a file, the resolution value determines the size the image will have on paper, and as a result, the physical size of the pixels. The same 900x600 pixel image may be printed as a small 3x2" card with barely noticeable pixels &mdash; or as a large poster with large, chunky pixels. Images imported from cameras and mobile devices tend to have a resolution value attached to the file. The value is usually 72 or 96ppi. It is important to realize that this value is arbitrary and was chosen for historic reasons. You can always change the resolution value inside

A Channel is a single component of a pixel's color. For a colored pixel in
The entire rectangular array of any one of the color components for all of the pixels in an image is also referred to as a Channel. You can see these color channels with the

Problems of a non Color Managed Workflow
The basic problem of image manipulation without color management is that you do simply not see what you do. This affects two different areas:
There are differences in Colors caused by different color characteristics of different devices like cameras, scanners, displays or printers
There are differences in Colors caused by the limitations of the colorspace a specific device is able to handle
The main purpose of color management is to avoid such problems. The approach taken to do so involves the addition of a description of the color characteristic to an image or devices.
These descriptions are called
The creation of color profiles is most often done by the manufacturer of the devices themselves. To make these profiles usable independent of platform and operating system, the ICC (International Color Consortium) created a standard called ICC-profile that describes how color profiles are stored to files and embedded into images.
Introduction to a Color Managed Workflow
Most of the parameters and profiles described here can be set in the
Input
Most digital cameras embed a color profile to individual photo files without user interaction. Digital scanners usually come with a color profile, which they also attach to the scanned images.
Applying the ICC-profile
When opening an image with an embedded color profile,
In case for some reason a color profile is not embedded in the image and you know (or have a good guess) which one it should be, you can manually assign it to that image.

For the best results, you need a color profile for your monitor. If a monitor profile is configured, either system-wide or in the Color Management section of the

Display Calibration and Profiling
Color management
Color profile
For displays there are two steps involved. One is called calibration and the other is called profiling. Also, calibration generally involves two steps. The first involves adjusting external monitor controls such as Contrast, Brightness, Color Temperature, etc, and it is highly dependent on the specific monitor. In addition there are further adjustments that are loaded into the video card memory to bring the monitor as close to a standard state as possible. This information is stored in the monitor profile in the so-called vgct tag. Probably under Windows XP or Mac OS, the operating system loads this information (LUT) in the video card in the process of starting your computer. Under Linux, at present you have to use an external program such as xcalib or dispwin. (If one just does a simple visual calibration using a web site such as that of Norman Koren, one might only use xgamma to load a gamma value.)
The second step, profiling, derives a set of rules which allow

Brushes in this category can make more than one kind of mark on an image. They are indicated by small red triangles at the lower right corner of the brush symbol in the Brushes dialog. They are sometimes called "animated brushes" because the marks change as you trace out a brushstroke. In principle, image hose brushes can be very sophisticated, especially if you use a tablet, changing shape as a function of pressure, angle, etc. These possibilities have never really been exploited, however; and the ones supplied with
