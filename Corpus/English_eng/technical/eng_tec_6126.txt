The Configuration Dialog
The Interface Options section is rather self-explanatory.
The Exposure Indicators lets one choose the color to use when the under- respectively over-exposure indicators are selected. Preferentially the colors should be contrasting with what they indicate, that is, under-exposure should have a light color and over-exposure areas should show dark colors.
