Stock
A Stock chart illustrates the market trend given by opening price, bottom price, top price and closing price.
The transaction volume can also be shown.
For a Stock chart the order of the data series is important.
The data should be arranged as shown in the example table below.

The open, low, high, and closing values of a row build together one data unit in the chart.
A stock price data series consists of several rows containing such data units.
The column containing the transaction volume builds an optional second data series.
Depending on the chosen variant, you do not need all columns.
Stock Chart Variants
Stock
chart type on the first page of the
Chart wizard
.
Then select one of the four variants.
Type 1
low
and high
column the Type 1 shows the distance between bottom price (low) and top price (high) by a vertical line.
low, high
and
close
columns, Type 1 shows an additional horizontal mark for the closing price.
Type 2
open, low, high
, and
close
columns, Type 2 generates the traditional &quot; candle stick &quot; chart.
Type 2 draws the vertical line between the bottom and top price and adds a rectangle in front, which visualises the range between the opening and closing price.
If you click on the rectangle you will see more information in the status bar. %PRODUCTNAME uses different fill colours for rising values (the opening price is lower than the closing price) and falling values.
Type 3
volume, low, high
, and
close
columns, Type 3 draws a chart like Type 1, with additional columns for the transaction volume.
Type 4
volume, open, low, high
, and
close
, Type 4 combines a chart of Type 2 with a column chart for the transaction volume.
Because measurement for transaction volume might be &quot; units &quot; , a second yÂ axis is introduced in chart Type 3 and Type 4.
The price axis is shown on the right side and the volume axis on the left side.
Setting the Data Source
Charts based on its own data
Chart Data Table
from the View menu or from the context menu of the chart in edit mode.
In an embedded chart data table, the data series are always organised in columns.
For a new stock chart first use a column chart.
Add the columns you need and enter your data in the order which are shown in the example, omitting any columns not required for the desired variant.
Use Move Series Right to change the column order.
Close the chart data table.
Now use the Chart Type dialogue box to change to the stock chart variant.
If you have already got a stock chart and you want to change the variant, then first change the chart type to a column chart, add or remove columns so that it fits to the variant, and then change the chart type back to a stock chart.
Do not write the name of a data series in a row.
Write the name into the field above the role name.
The order of the rows determines how the categories are arranged in the chart.
Use Move Row Down to change the order.
Charts based on Calc or Writer tables
Data Range
dialogue box.
For fine tuning use the
Data Series
dialogue box.
To specify a data range do one of the following:
Enter the data range in the text box.
In Calc, an example data range would be &quot; $Sheet1.$B$3:$B$14 &quot; .
Note that a data range may consist of more than one region in a spreadsheet, e.g. &quot; $Sheet1.A1:A5;$Sheet1.D1:D5 &quot; is also a valid data range.
In Writer, an example data range would be &quot; Table1.A1:E4 &quot; .
As long as the syntax is not correct, %PRODUCTNAME shows the text in red.
Select data range
to minimise the dialogue box, then drag to select the data range.
When you release the mouse, the data are entered.
Click
Select data range
again to add a data range.
In the input field of the minimised dialogue box, click after the entry and type a semicolon.
Then drag to select the next range.
Click one of the options for data series in rows or in columns.
Your stock chart data are &quot; in columns &quot; , if the information in a row belongs to the same &quot; candle stick &quot; .
Fine Tuning the Data Ranges of Table Based Stock Charts
You can organise data series and edit the source for parts of single data series on the third page of the Chart wizard or on the page Data Series in the Data Range dialogue box.
Organise Data Series
data series
area on the left side of the dialogue box, you can organise the data series of the actual chart.
A stock chart has at least one data series containing the prices.
It might have a second data series for transaction volume.
If you have more than one price data series, use the Up and Down arrow buttons to order them.
The order determines the arrangement in the chart.
Do the same for volume data series.
You cannot switch price and volume data series.
Remove

You get an empty entry below the selected one, which has the same type.
If you have no price data series or no volume data series, you must first select a range for these series in the
Data Range
dialogue box.
Setting Data Ranges
Data Ranges
dialogue box you can set or change the data range of each component of the selected data series.
In the upper list you will see the role name of the components and the current values.
When you have selected a role, you can change the value in the text box below the list.
The label shows the selected role.
