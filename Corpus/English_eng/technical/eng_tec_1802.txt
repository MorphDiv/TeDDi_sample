formula.
All available operators appear in the lower part of the Formula Elements window.
They are also listed in the
context menu
of the
Commands
window.
All operators not contained in the Formula Elements window or in the context menu must be typed manually in the
Commands
window.

Operator Functions
Icon
Limit
limit sign
with one placeholder.
You can also enter
lim < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Summation
summation sign
with one placeholder.
You can also enter
sum < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Product
product sign
with one placeholder.
You can also type
prod < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Coproduct
coproduct symbol
with one placeholder.
You can also enter
coprod < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Upper and Lower Limit
upper and lower limit
for integral and summation with one placeholder.
You can also type
from{ < ? > } to{ < ? > } < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Limit statements must be combined with the appropriate operators.
The limits will be centred above/below the summation character.
Icon
Integral
integral
sign with one placeholder.
You can also type
int < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Double Integral
double integral
symbol with one placeholder.
You can also type
iint < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Triple Integral
a triple integral
sign with one placeholder.
You can also type
iiint < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Lower Limit
lower limit
range statement for integral and sum with placeholders.
You can also type
from { < ? > } < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Curve Integral
curve integral
symbol with one placeholder.
You can also type
lint < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Double Curve Integral
double curve integral
symbol with one placeholder.
You can also type
llint < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Triple Curve Integral
triple curve integral
sign with one placeholder.
You can also type
lllint < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Icon
Upper Limit
upper limit
for integral and summation with placeholders
You can also type
to < ? > < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
Limit statements can only be used if combined with the appropriate operators.
limit
symbol.
This method is faster than typing the commands directly.
liminf
inserts the
limes inferior
with one placeholder.
You can also type
liminf < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
limsup
inserts the
limes superior
with one placeholder.
You can also type
limsup < ? >
directly in the
Commands
window.
oper
in the Commands window, you can insert
user-defined operators
in $[officename] Math, a feature useful for incorporating special characters into a formula.
An example is
oper %theta x
.
Using the
oper
command, you can also insert characters not in the default $[officename] character set.
oper
can also be used in connection with limits; for example,
oper %union from {i=1} to n x_{i}
.
In this example, the union symbol is indicated by the name
union
.
However, this is not one of the predefined symbols.
To define it, choose
Tools - Catalogue
. select
Special
as the symbol set in the dialogue box that appears, then click the
Edit
button.
In the next dialogue box, select
Special
as the symbol set again.
Enter a meaningful name in the
Symbol
text box, for example, &quot; union &quot; and then click the union symbol in the set of symbols.
Click
Add
and then
OK
.
Click
Close
to close the
Symbols
dialogue box.
You are now finished and can type the union symbol in the Commands window, by entering
oper %union
.
sum_a^b c
in the Commands window to arrange the limits to the right of the sum symbol.
If your limit entries contain longer expressions, you must put them in group (curly) brackets, for example, sum_{i=1}^{2*n} b.
When formulae are imported from older versions this is done automatically.
To change the spacing (gaps) between the characters choose
Format - Spacing - Category -
Indices
or
Format - Spacing - Category -
Limits
.
Additional basic information about indices is given elsewhere in the
Help
.
When you type information manually in the Commands window, note that a number of operators require spaces for correct structure.
This is especially true when your operators are supplied with values instead of placeholders, for example, lim a_{n}=a.
