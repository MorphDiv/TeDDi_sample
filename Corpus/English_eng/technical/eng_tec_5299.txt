Appendix B.
Migrating from PHP 3 to PHP 4

Static variable and class member initializers only accept scalar values while in PHP 3 they accepted any valid expression.
This is, once again, due to the split between parsing and execution as no code has yet been executed when the parser sees the initializer.
For classes you should use constructors to initialize member variables instead.
For static variables anything but a simple static value rarely makes sense anyway.
