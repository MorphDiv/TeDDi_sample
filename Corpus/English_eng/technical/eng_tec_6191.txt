Timidty is a MIDI-to-WAVE converter but you can use this program as software synthesizer. TiMidity works purely as the software real-time MIDI render, that is as a software MIDI synth engine on ALSA.
Restart KTabEdit and try to launch the timidity sequencer with alsa emulation? (It must be compiled with alsa support.)

Jazz note names are very special and should be used only if really know what you do. Usage of jazz note names without a purpose would confuse or mislead anyone reading the music who did not have a knowledge of jazz note naming. Are you sure you want to use jazz notes?

Chord
Plain single chord, all notes sound at the same time.
6/ 8 Standard Arpeggio
Classic arpeggio, played in 6/ 8. Makes very good accompaniment for slow, lyric songs. Used in the raw form (playing open strings) by Metallica in the song "Nothing Else Matters"
4/ 4 Short Arpeggio
Shortened variation of classic arpeggio, with chord-like two simultaneous string pick in the middle. A cross between classic arpeggio and bass pick technique.
8/ 8 Arpeggio 1
Pretty complex arpeggio that makes dynamic progressing and continuous rhythm line. Fits best in medium tempo upbeat songs.
8/ 8 Arpeggio 2
Variation of previous arpeggio, can spice up sound if used several times with previous rhythm.
3/ 4 Smooth Arpeggio With Return
Smooth accelerating and decelerating arpeggio. Played mostly with a pick, strumming relatively slow through the strings. Well-known from a song "House of the Rising Sun", performed by Animals and many others.
4/ 4 Rock Ballad Arpeggio 1
One of the most famous rock arpeggios. If played in a correct way, could make a smooth continuous rhythm, good for verses. One of the most well-known songs that uses such arpeggio is "Do n't Cry" by Guns'n'Roses.
4/ 4 Rock Ballad Arpeggio 2
Smooth rock ballad arpeggio. Picking pattern could seem a bit random-like, though the whole arpeggio makes a pretty smooth rhythm. Good for slow and lyric ballads. Performed by Smokie in their song "Living Next Door to Alice"
4/ 4 Rock Ballad Arpeggio 3
Weird, but simple combination of classic arpeggios, makes a good continuous rock lyric arpeggio, with a bit of Spanish feel. Used in the song of Scorpions "Holiday"
4/ 4 Rock Ballad Arpeggio 4
Classic stairway rock arpeggio, this thing was the learning pattern for lots of various musicians. Very regular 4/ 4, first accented note is a good metronome. Used in (and most likely originating from) Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven"
4/ 4 Rock Ballad Arpeggio 5
Folk style picking, named "Travis picking" after Merle Travis who apparently came up with it first. Arpeggio line is somewhat syncopated, giving a special feel. Good example of such picking is Kansas' "Dust in the Wind"
4/ 4 Normal Bass Pick
Classic bass pick technique with alteration. Played in 2 steps: at the first step some sort of bass note is picked and at the second step the bunch of trebles sounds. Very popular thing for lyric songs on acoustic (especially 7-string) guitar.
3/ 4 Waltz Bass Pick
Waltz style bass pick. Makes a perfect dance rhythm - played on 3/ 4, with the first beat accented by bass note. Could be used in classic guitar playing experience, for example, in orchestra.
4/ 4 Deep Bass Pick
Normal bass pick with a shuffled, bluesey feel, made by delaying bass notes by an extra 1/ 8. A good simple rhythm for blues and folk songs.
4/ 4 Strumming 1
Shuffle-feeled strumming.
