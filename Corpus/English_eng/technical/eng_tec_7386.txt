Enable remote access to the desktop
If true, allows remote access to the desktop via the RFB protocol. Users on remote machines may then connect to the desktop using a VNC viewer.
Prompt the user before completing a connection
If true, remote users accessing the desktop are not allowed access until the user on the host machine approves the connection. Recommended especially when access is not password protected.
Only allow remote users to view the desktop
If true, remote users accessing the desktop are only allowed to view the desktop. Remote users will not be able to use the mouse or keyboard.
Network interface for listening
If not set, the server will listen on all network interfaces.

Set this if you want to accept connections only from some specific network interface. For example, eth0, wifi0, lo and so on.
Listen on an alternative port
If true, the server will listen on another port, instead of the default (5900). The port must be specified in the 'alternative-port' key.
Alternative port number
The port which the server will listen to if the 'use-alternative-port' key is set to true. Valid values are in the range of 5000 to 50000.
Require encryption
If true, remote users accessing the desktop are required to support encryption. It is highly recommended that you use a client which supports encryption unless the intervening network is trusted.
Allowed authentication methods
Lists the authentication methods with which remote users may access the desktop.

There are two possible authentication methods; "vnc" causes the remote user to be prompted for a password (the password is specified by the vnc-password key) before connecting and "none" which allows any remote user to connect.
Password required for "vnc" authentication
The password which the remote user will be prompted for if the "vnc" authentication method is used. The password specified by the key is base64 encoded.

The special value of 'keyring' (which is not valid base64) means that the password is stored in the GNOME keyring.
E-mail address to which the remote desktop URL should be sent
This key specifies the e-mail address to which the remote desktop URL should be sent if the user clicks on the URL in the Desktop Sharing preferences dialog.
Lock the screen when last user disconnect
If true, the screen will be locked after the last remote client disconnects.
When the status icon should be shown
This key controls the behavior of the status icon. There are three options: "always" - the icon will always be present; "client" - the icon will only be present when someone is connected (this is the default behavior); "never" - the icon will not be present.
Whether to disable the desktop background when a user is connected
When true, disable the desktop background and replace it with a single block of color when a user successfully connects.
Whether a UPnP router should be used to forward and open ports
If true, request that a UPnP-capable router should forward and open the port used by Vino.
Whether we should disable the XDamage extension of X.org
If true, do not use the XDamage extension of X.org. This extension does not work properly on some video drivers when using 3D effects. Disabling it will make Vino work in these environments, with slower rendering as a side effect.
Notify on connect
If true, show a notification when a user connects to the system.
