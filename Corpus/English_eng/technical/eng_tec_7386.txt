Preferred export format
This is the preferred export format, used as a default when exporting items, or dropping them outside of the application. Possible values are: - "GConfSchemaV1": this used to be the historical export format. The exported file may later be imported via Import assistant of the Nautilus Actions Configuration Tool, or via the gconftool-2 --import-schema-file command-line tool. - "GConfSchemaV2": a lighter while still compatible schema. The exported file may later be imported via Import assistant of the Nautilus Actions Configuration Tool, or via the gconftool-2 --import-schema-file command-line tool. - "GConfEntry": this should be the preferred format for newly exported actions. The exported file may later be imported via Import assistant of the Nautilus Actions Configuration Tool, or via the gconftool-2 --load command-line tool. - "Ask": the user will be asked at runtime for the format he wishes use.

Position and size of the interaction dialog at import time
Position and size of the interaction dialog at import time ; default is set by the window manager.
Last folder selected when choosing a folder from where import new actions.
Import mode
Last import mode choosen in the Import assistant. Possible values are : - "NoImport": do not import an action whose UUID already exists, - "Renumber": allocate a new UUID if the imported UUID already exists, - "Override": override the existing action with the imported one, - "Ask": ask the user each time.
I/O providers Write priority
The order in which I/O providers are tested when we need to write a new item down to a storage subsystem.
Add an 'About' item in the Nautilus context menu
If TRUE, and if the user has defined a single root menu for its actions, then an 'About Nautilus Actions' will be displayed at end of the first submenu.
Sort mode
This preference indicates the preferred sort mode. Possible values are : - "AscendingOrder": the actions are maintained in ascending alphabetical order (historical behavior). - "DescendingOrder": the actions are maintained in descending alphabetical order. - "ManualOrder": user is free to reorder them via Nautilus-Actions configuration tool.
Define a 'Nautilus Actions' root menu
If TRUE, then a 'Nautilus Actions' item will be defined in the Nautilus context menu, and will a root menu of all available actions.
List of items at first level of the hierarchy
UUID of the items at the first level of the hierarchy. If this key is not found or empty, then all found items are considered as a flat list.

Position and size of the preferences dialog ; default is set by the window manager.
List of default schemes
The list of schemes proposed by default on each new profile. A default default list is harcoded in nautilus-actions-config-tool, which may be updated by the user.
Whether the whole configuration is locked
The whole configuration must be understood here as the global set and order of menus and actions. When this configuration is locked, then the user is no more able to modify nor create or delete any menu or action. All items are read-only. As the order of items is also locked, the level zero itself cannot be modified, and the user is unable to reorder the items.
Whether the GConf I/O provider is locked
When set to true (most probably as a mandatory key), this prevents all items, menus and actions, readen from GConf to being modified in NACT.
Whether the Desktop I/O provider is locked
When set to true (most probably as a mandatory key), this prevents all items, menus and actions, readen from .desktop files to being modified in NACT.

List of patterns to be matched against the selected file(s)/folder(s)
A list of strings with joker '*' or '?' to be matched against the name(s) of the selected file(s)/folder(s). Each selected items must match at least one of the filename patterns for the action or the menu be candidate to display.
This obviously only applies when there is a selection.
Defaults to '*'.
A pattern to be matched against basenames of selected file(s)/folder(s). May include wildcards (* or ?). You must set one option for each pattern you need
<EXPR>
Whether the specified basenames are case sensitive (default)
Must be set to 'true' if the filename patterns are case sensitive, to 'false' otherwise. E.g., if you need to match a filename in a case-sensitive manner, set this key to 'true'. If you also want, for example '*.jpg' to match 'photo.JPG', then set 'false'.
This obviously only applies when there is a selection.
Defaults to 'true'.
List of patterns to be matched against the mimetypes of the selected file(s)/folder(s)
A list of strings with joker '*' to be matched against the mimetypes of the selected file(s)/folder(s). Each selected items must match at least one of the mimetype patterns for the action to appear.
This obviously only applies when there is a selection.
Defaults to '*'.
A pattern to be matched against mimetypes of selected file(s)/folder(s). May include wildcards (* or ?). You must set one option for each pattern you need
Whether the profile applies to files
Set to 'true' if the selection can have files, to 'false' otherwise.
This setting is tied in with the 'isdir' setting. The valid combinations are: 
isfile=TRUE and isdir=FALSE: the selection may hold only files
isfile=FALSE and isdir=TRUE: the selection may hold only folders
isfile=TRUE and isdir=TRUE: the selection may hold both files and folders
isfile=FALSE and isdir=FALSE: this is an invalid combination (your configuration will never appear).
This obviously only applies when there is a selection.
Defaults to 'true'.
Whether the profile applies to folders
Set to 'true' if the selection can have folders, to 'false' otherwise.
This setting is tied in with the 'isfile' setting. The valid combinations are: 
isfile=TRUE and isdir=FALSE: the selection may hold only files
isfile=FALSE and isdir=TRUE: the selection may hold only folders
isfile=TRUE and isdir=TRUE: the selection may hold both files and folders
isfile=FALSE and isdir=FALSE: this is an invalid combination (your configuration will never appear).
This obviously only applies when there is a selection.
Defaults to 'false'.
Whether the selection may be multiple
If you need more than one files or folders to be selected, set this key to 'true'. If you want just one file or folder, set it to 'false'.
This obviously only applies when there is a selection.
Defaults to 'false'.
List of schemes to be matched against those of selected file(s)/folder(s)
Defines the list of valid schemes to be matched against the selected items. The scheme is the protocol used to access the files. The keyword to use is the one used in the URI by the file manager.
Examples of valid URI include:
- file:///tmp/foo.txt
- sftp:///root@test.example.net/tmp/foo.txt
The most common schemes are:
'file': local files
'sftp': files accessed via SSH
'ftp': files accessed via FTP
'smb': files accessed via Samba (Windows share)
'dav': files accessed via WebDAV.
All schemes used by your favorite file manager may be used here.
This obviously only applies when there is a selection, or when targeting the special 'x-nautilus-desktop' scheme.
Defaults to 'file'.
A valid GIO scheme where the selected file(s)/folder(s) should be located. You must set one option for each scheme you need
<STRING>
List of folders
Defines the list of valid paths to be matched against the current folder.
 All folders 'under' the specified path are considered valid.
Defaults to '/'.
The path of a (parent) directory for which the item will be displayed. You must set one option for each folder you need
<PATH>
