CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2:
a) as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease.
Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments.
Hormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments.
b) in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable.
c) in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.
d) in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, not previously treated with trastuzumab.
Early Breast Cancer (EBC)
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) (see 5.1).
Herceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay (see 4.4 and 5.1).
2 4.2 Posology and method of administration
HER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of Herceptin therapy (see 4.4 and 5.1).
Herceptin treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy (see 4.4).
MBC Weekly schedule:
The following loading and subsequent doses are recommended for monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel, docetaxel or an aromatase inhibitor.
Loading dose The recommended initial loading dose of Herceptin is 4 mg/ kg body weight.
Subsequent doses The recommended weekly dose of Herceptin is 2 mg/ kg body weight, beginning one week after the loading dose.
Method of administration Herceptin is administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion.
Patients should be observed for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion and for two hours after the start of the subsequent infusions for symptoms like fever and chills or other infusion-related symptoms (see 4.4 and 4.8).
Interruption of the infusion may help control such symptoms.
The infusion may be resumed when symptoms abate.
If the initial loading dose was well tolerated, the subsequent doses can be administered as a 30-minute infusion.
Emergency equipment must be available.
Administration in combination with Paclitaxel or docetaxel In the pivotal trials, paclitaxel or docetaxel was administered the day following the first dose of Herceptin (for dose, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for paclitaxel or docetaxel) and immediately after the subsequent doses of Herceptin if the preceding dose of Herceptin was well tolerated.
Administration in combination with an aromatase inhibitor In the pivotal trial Herceptin and anastrozole were administered from day 1.
There were no restrictions on the relative timing of Herceptin and anastrozole at administration (for dose, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors).
Duration of treatment Herceptin should be administered until progression of disease.
MBC 3-weekly schedule:
Alternatively the following loading and subsequent doses are recommended for monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel, docetaxel or an aromatase inhibitor.
Initial loading dose of 8 mg/ kg body weight, followed by 6 mg/ kg body weight 3 weeks later and then 6 mg/ kg repeated at 3-weekly intervals administered as infusions over approximately 90 minutes.
Duration of treatment Herceptin should be administered until progression of disease.
EBC 3-weekly schedule:
In the HERA trial, Herceptin was initiated after completions of standard chemotherapy (most commonly, anthracycline-containing regimens or anthracyclines plus a taxane).
3 Initial loading dose of 8 mg/ kg body weight, followed by 6 mg/ kg body weight 3 weeks later and then 6 mg/ kg repeated at 3-weekly intervals administered as infusions over approximately 90 minutes.
Patients with early breast cancer should be treated for 1 year or until disease recurrence.
EBC weekly schedule:
In the adjuvant setting, Herceptin has also been investigated as a weekly regimen (an initial loading dose of 4 mg/ kg followed by 2 mg/ kg every week for one year) concomitantly with paclitaxel (administered weekly (80 mg/ m2) or every 3 weeks (175 mg/ m2) for a total of 12 weeks) following 4 cycles of AC (doxorubicin 60 mg/ m2 IV push concurrently with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/ m2 over 20– 30 minutes).
MBC and EBC:
Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus.
For instructions for use and handling refer to 6.6.
Dose reduction No reductions in the dose of Herceptin were made during clinical trials.
Patients may continue Herceptin therapy during periods of reversible, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression but they should be monitored carefully for complications of neutropenia during this time.
Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for paclitaxel, docetaxel or aromatase inhibitor for information on dose reduction or delays.
Missed doses during 3-weekly schedule If the patient misses a dose of Herceptin by one week or less, then the usual dose of Herceptin (6 mg/ kg) should be given as soon as possible (do not wait until the next planned cycle).
Subsequent maintenance Herceptin doses of 6 mg/ kg should then be given every 3 weeks, according to the previous schedule.
If the patient misses a dose of Herceptin by more than one week, a re-loading dose of Herceptin should be given (8 mg/ kg over approximately 90 minutes).
Subsequent maintenance Herceptin doses of 6 mg/ kg should then be given every 3 weeks from that point.
Special patient populations Clinical data show that the disposition of Herceptin is not altered based on age or serum creatinine (see 5.2).
In clinical trials, elderly patients did not receive reduced doses of Herceptin.
Dedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment have not been carried out.
However in a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age and renal impairment were not shown to affect trastuzumab disposition.
Paediatric use Herceptin is not recommended for use in children below 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Patients with known hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, or to any of the excipients.
Patients with severe dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring supplementary oxygen therapy.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
HER2 testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory which can ensure adequate validation of the testing procedures (see 5.1).
4 Currently no data from clinical trials are available on Herceptin re-treatment of patients with previous exposure to Herceptin in the adjuvant setting.
The use of Herceptin is associated with cardiotoxicity.
All candidates for treatment should undergo careful cardiac monitoring (see “ cardiotoxicity” section below). The risk of cardiotoxicity is greatest when Herceptin is used in combination with anthracyclines.
Therefore Herceptin and anthracyclines should not be used currently in combination except in a well-controlled clinical trial setting with cardiac monitoring.
Patients who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiotoxicity with Herceptin treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of Herceptin and anthracyclines.
Because the half-life of Herceptin is approximately 28.5 days (95% confidence interval, 25.5 – 32.8 days), Herceptin may persist in the circulation for up to 24 weeks after stopping Herceptin treatment.
Patients who receive anthracyclines after stopping Herceptin may possibly be at increased risk of cardiotoxicity.
If possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline- based therapy for up to 24 weeks after stopping Herceptin.
If anthracyclines are used, the patient’ s cardiac function should be monitored carefully (see “ cardiotoxicity” section below).
Serious adverse reactions including infusion reactions, hypersensitivity, allergic-like reactions and pulmonary events have been observed in patients receiving Herceptin therapy.
Patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction.
These severe reactions were usually associated with the first infusion of Herceptin and generally occurred during or immediately following the infusion.
For some patients, symptoms progressively worsened and led to further pulmonary complications.
Initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical deterioration have also been reported.
Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week following infusion.
On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of infusion symptoms or pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the Herceptin infusion.
Patients should be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact their physician if these symptoms occur.
Infusion reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity Serious adverse reactions to Herceptin infusion that have been reported infrequently include dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, hypertension, bronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrythmia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, respiratory distress, urticaria and angioedema (see 4.8).
The majority of these events occur during or within 2.5 hours of the start of the first infusion.
Should an infusion reaction occur the Herceptin infusion should be discontinued and the patient monitored until resolution of any observed symptoms (see 4.2).
The majority of patients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently received further infusions of Herceptin.
Serious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen, beta-agonists, and corticosteroids.
In rare cases, these reactions are associated with a clinical course culminating in a fatal outcome.
Patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction.
Therefore, these patients should not be treated with Herceptin (see 4.3).
Pulmonary events Severe pulmonary events have been reported rarely with the use of Herceptin in the post-marketing setting (see 4.8).
These rare events have occasionally been fatal.
In addition, rare cases of pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have been reported.
These events may occur as part of an infusion-related reaction or with a delayed onset.
Patients who are experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events.
Therefore, these patients should not be treated with Herceptin (see 4.3).
Caution should be exercised for pneumonitis, especially in patients being treated concomitantly with taxanes.
Cardiotoxicity Heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II-IV) has been observed in patients receiving Herceptin therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, partcularly
5 following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin )– containing chemotherapy.
This may be moderate to severe and has been associated with death (see 4.8).
All candidates for treatment with Herceptin, but especially those with prior anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and physical examination, ECG, echocardiogram, or MUGA scan or magnetic resonance imaging.
A careful risk-benefit assessment should be made before deciding to treat with Herceptin.
In EBC, the following patients were excluded from the HERA trial, there are no data about the benefit: risk balance, and therefore treatment can not be recommended in such patients: • History of documented CHF • High-risk uncontrolled arrhythmias • Angina pectoris requiring medication • Clinically significant valvular disease • Evidence of transmural infarction on ECG • Poorly controlled hypertension
Formal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular concerns following baseline screening.
Cardiac function should be further monitored during treatment (e. g. every three months).
Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac dysfunction.
For early breast cancer patients, cardiac assessment, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 months during treatment and at 6, 12 and 24 months following cessation of treatment.
Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more frequent monitoring (e. g. every 6-8 weeks).
If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular function, but remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical benefit of Herceptin therapy has been seen.
Caution should be exercised in treating patients with symptomatic heart failure, a history of hypertension or documented coronary artery disease, and in early breast cancer, in those patients with an LVEF of 55% or less.
If LVEF drops 10 ejection points from baseline AND to below 50%, Herceptin should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately 3 weeks.
If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, discontinuation of Herceptin should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks.
All such patients should be referred for assessment by a cardiologist and followed up.
If symptomatic cardiac failure develops during Herceptin therapy, it should be treated with the standard medications for this purpose.
Discontinuation of Herceptin therapy should be strongly considered in patients who develop clinically significant heart failure unless the benefits for an individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks.
The safety of continuation or resumption of Herceptin in patients who experience cardiotoxicity has not been prospectively studied.
However, most patients who developed heart failure in the pivotal trials improved with standard medical treatment.
This included diuretics, cardiac glycosides, beta- blockers and/ or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
The majority of patients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of Herceptin treatment continued on weekly therapy with Herceptin without additional clinical cardiac events.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
A risk for interactions with concomitant medication cannot be excluded.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
6 Reproduction studies have been conducted in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of the weekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/ kg Herceptin and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus.
Placental transfer of trastuzumab during the early (Days 20– 50 of gestation) and late (Days 120– 150 of gestation) foetal development period was observed.
It is not known whether Herceptin can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or whether it can affect reproductive capacity.
As animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Herceptin should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
In the postmarketing setting, cases of oligohydramnios have been reported in pregnant women receiving Herceptin.
Lactation A study conducted in lactating cynomolgus monkeys at doses 25 times that of the weekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/ kg Herceptin demonstrated that trastuzumab is secreted in the milk.
The presence of trastuzumab in the serum of infant monkeys was not associated with any adverse effects on their growth or development from birth to 1 month of age.
It is not known whether trastuzumab is secreted in human milk.
As human IgG1 is secreted into human milk, and the potential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should not breast-feed during Herceptin therapy and for 6 months after the last dose of Herceptin.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and to use machines have been performed.
Patients experiencing infusion-related symptoms should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate.

These numbers include patients with preferred terms of ‘ febrile neutropenia’, ‘ neutropenic sepsis’ or ‘ neutropenia’ that was associated with fever (and antibiotic use).
See also section 4.8 There was an increased incidence of SAEs (40% vs.
31%) and Grade 4 AEs (34% vs.
23%) in the combination arm compared to docetaxel monotherapy.
In a further randomised clinical trial (BO16216), patients with HER2 positive and hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer received anastrozole with or without Herceptin.
In this trial, there was no change in the safety profile compared with previous trials in the metastatic population.

12 Infusion-Related Symptoms During the first infusion of Herceptin chills and/ or fever are observed commonly in patients.
Other signs and/ or symptoms may include nausea, hypertension, vomiting, pain, rigors, headache, cough, dizziness, rash, and asthenia.
These symptoms are usually mild to moderate in severity, and occur infrequently with subsequent Herceptin infusions.
These symptoms can be treated with an analgesic/ antipyretic such as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (see 4.2).
Some adverse reactions to Herceptin infusion including dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrythmia, reduced oxygen saturation and respiratory distress can be serious and potentially fatal (see 4.4).
Allergic-like and hypersensitivity reactions Allergic reactions, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, urticaria and angioedema occurring during the first infusion of Herceptin, have been reported rarely.
Over a third of these patients had a negative re- challenge and continued to receive Herceptin.
Some of these reactions can be serious and potentially fatal (see 4.4).
Serious pulmonary events Single cases of pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory insufficiency have been reported rarely.
These events have been reported rarely with fatal outcome (see 4.4).
Cardiac toxicity Reduced ejection fraction and signs and symptoms of heart failure, such as dyspnoea, orthopnoea, increased cough, pulmonary oedema, and S3 gallop, have been observed in patients treated with Herceptin.
(see 4.4).
The incidence of cardiac adverse events from retrospective analysis of data from the combination therapy study (Herceptin plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone and the Herceptin monotherapy study is shown in the following table:

In the HERA trial, NYHA class III-IV heart failure was observed in 0.6% of patients in the one-year arm.
Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic NYHA class I – II events were observed in 3.0% of patients in the Herceptin arm compared to 0.5% of patients in the observation arm.
The percentage of patients with at least one significant LVEF drop (decrease of ≥ 10 EF points and to < 50%) during the study was 7.4% in the 1 year Herceptin arm versus 2.3% in the observation arm.
Haematological toxicity Haematological toxicity was infrequent following the administration of Herceptin as a single agent in the metastatic setting, WHO Grade 3 leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia occurring in < 1% of patients.
No WHO Grade 4 toxicities were observed.
There was an increase in WHO Grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity in patients treated with the combination of Herceptin and paclitaxel compared with patients receiving paclitaxel alone (34% versus 21%).
Haematological toxicity was also increased in patients receiving Herceptin and docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone (32% grade 3/ 4 neutropenia versus 22%, using NCI-CTC criteria).
Note that this is likely to be an underestimate since docetaxel alone at a dose of 100mg/ m2 is known to result in neutropenia in 97% of patients, 76% grade 4, based on nadir blood counts.
The incidence of febrile neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis was also increased in patients treated with Herceptin plus docetaxel (23% versus 17% for patients treated with docetaxel alone).
Using NCI-CTC criteria, in the HERA trial, 0.4% of Herceptin-treated patients experienced a shift of 3 or 4 grades from baseline, compared with 0.6% in the observation arm.
Hepatic and renal toxicity WHO Grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity was observed in 12% of patients following administration of Herceptin as single agent, in the metastatic setting.
This toxicity was associated with progression of disease in the liver in 60% of these patients.
WHO Grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity was less frequently observed among patients receiving Herceptin and paclitaxel than among patients receiving paclitaxel (7% compared with 15%).
No WHO Grade 3 or 4 renal toxicity was observed in patients treated with Herceptin.
Diarrhoea Of patients treated with Herceptin as a single agent in the metastatic setting, 27% experienced diarrhoea.
An increase in the incidence of diarrhoea, primarily mild to moderate in severity, has also been observed in patients receiving Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel compared with patients receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel alone.
In the HERA trial, 7% of Herceptin-treated patients had diarrhoea.
Infection
14 An increased incidence of infections, primarily mild upper respiratory infections of minor clinical significance or catheter infections, has been observed primarily in patients treated with Herceptin plus paclitaxel or docetaxel compared with patients receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel alone.
4.9 Overdose
There is no experience with overdosage in human clinical trials.
Single doses of Herceptin alone greater than 10 mg/ kg have not been administered in the clinical trials.
Doses up to this level were well tolerated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antineoplastic agents, ATC code:
L01XC03
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20 %-30% of primary breast cancers.
Studies indicate that patients whose tumours overexpress HER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not overexpress HER2.
The extracellular domain of the receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into the blood stream and measured in serum samples.
Trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2.
Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2.
Detection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification Herceptin should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay.
HER2 overexpression should be detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of fixed tumour blocks (see 4.4).
HER2 gene amplification should be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) of fixed tumour blocks.
Patients are eligible for Herceptin treatment if they show strong HER2 overexpression as described by a 3+ score by IHC or a positive FISH or CISH result.
To ensure accurate and reproducible results, the testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory, which can ensure validation of the testing procedures.
The recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as follows:
Staining Intensity Score
Staining pattern
HER2 Overexpression Assessment
No staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in < 10% of the tumour cells
Negative
1+
A faint/ barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in > 10% of the tumour cells.
The cells are only stained in part of their membrane.
Negative
2+
A weak to moderate complete membrane staining is detected in > 10% of the tumour cells.
Weak to moderate overexpression
3+
A moderate to strong complete membrane staining is detected in > 10% of the tumour cells.
Moderate to strong overexpression
15 In general, FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour cell to the chromosome 17 copy number is greater than or equal to 2, or if there are more than 4 copies of the HER2 gene per tumour cell if no chromosome 17 control is used.
In general, CISH is considered positive if there are more than 5 copies of the HER2 gene per nucleus in greater than 50% of tumour cells.
For full instructions on assay performance and interpretation please refer to the package inserts of validated FISH and CISH assays.
Official recommendations on HER2 testing may also apply.
For any other method that may be used for the assessment of HER2 protein or gene expression, the analyses should only be performed by laboratories that provide adequate state-of-the-art performance of validated methods.
Such methods must clearly be precise and accurate enough to demonstrate overexpression of HER2 and must be able to distinguish between moderate (congruent with 2+) and strong (congruent with 3+) overexpression of HER2.
Clinical Data Herceptin has been used in clinical trials as monotherapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have tumours that overexpress HER2 and who have failed one or more chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease (Herceptin alone).
Herceptin has also been used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.
Patients who had previously received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/ m2 infused over 3 hours) with or without Herceptin.
In the pivotal trial of docetaxel (100 mg/ m2 infused over 1 hour) with or without Herceptin, 60% of the patients had received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
Patients were treated with Herceptin until progression of disease.
The efficacy of Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel in patients who did not receive prior adjuvant anthracyclines has not been studied.
However, Herceptin plus docetaxel was efficacious in patients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines.
The test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal Herceptin monotherapy and Herceptin plus paclitaxel clinical trials employed immunohistochemical staining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine monoclonal antibodies CB11 and 4D5.
These tissues were fixed in formalin or Bouin’ s fixative.
This investigative clinical trial assay performed in a central laboratory utilised a 0 to 3+ scale.
Patients classified as staining 2+ or 3+ were included, while those staining 0 or 1+ were excluded.
Greater than 70% of patients enrolled exhibited 3+ overexpression.
The data suggest that beneficial effects were greater among those patients with higher levels of overexpression of HER2 (3+).
The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in the pivotal trial of docetaxel, with or without Herceptin, was immunohistochemistry.
A minority of patients were tested using fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH).
In this trial, 87% of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+, and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+ and/ or FISH-positive.

Combination treatment with Herceptin and anastrozole
Herceptin has been studied in combination with anastrozole for first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in HER2 overexpressing, hormone-receptor (i. e. estrogen-receptor (ER) and/ or progesterone- receptor (PR)) positive postmenopausal patients.
Progression free survival was doubled in the Herceptin plus anastrozole arm compared to anastrozole (4.8 months versus 2.4 months).
For the other parameters the improvements seen for the combination were for overall response (16.5% versus 6.7%); clinical benefit rate (42.7% versus 27.9%); time to progression (4.8 months versus 2.4 months).
For time to response and duration of response no difference could be recorded between the arms.
The median overall survival was extended by 4.6 months for patients in the combination arm.
The difference was not statistically significant, however more than half of the patients in the anastrozole alone arm crossed over to a Herceptin containing regimen after progression of disease.

Early breast cancer is defined as non-metastatic primary invasive carcinoma of the breast.
Early breast cancer in the HERA trial was limited to operable, primary, invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast, with axillary nodes positive or axillary nodes negative if tumours at least 1 cm in diameter.
In the adjuvant setting, Herceptin was investigated in a multicentre, randomised, trial (HERA) designed to compare one year of three-weekly Herceptin treatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer following surgery, established chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable).
Patients assigned to receive Herceptin were given an initial loading dose of 8 mg/ kg, followed by 6 mg/ kg every three weeks for one year.
The efficacy results from the Hera trial are summarized in the following table:

For the primary endpoint, DFS, the hazard ratio translates into an absolute benefit, in terms of a 2-year disease-free survival rate, of 7.6 percentage points (85.8% vs 78.2%) in favour of the Herceptin arm.
Immunogenicity Nine hundred and three patients treated with Herceptin, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have been evaluated for antibody production.
Human anti-trastuzumab antibodies were detected in one patient, who had no allergic manifestations.
19 Sites of progression After Herceptin and paclitaxel therapy for metastatic breast cancer in patients in the pivotal trial the following sites of disease progression were found:

*Patients may have had multiple sites of disease progression
The frequency of progression in the liver was significantly reduced in patients treated with the combination of Herceptin and paclitaxel.
More patients treated with Herceptin and paclitaxel progressed in the central nervous system than those treated with paclitaxel alone.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab have been studied in patients with metastatic breast cancer and early breast cancer.
Short duration intravenous infusions of 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg trastuzumab once weekly in patients demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacokinetics.
Drug interaction studies have not been performed with Herceptin.
Half-life The half-life is approximately 28.5 days (95% confidence interval, 25.5 – 32.8 days).
The washout period is up to 24 weeks (95% confidence interval, 18-24 weeks)
Steady State Concentration Steady state pharmacokinetics should be reached by approximately 20 weeks (95% confidence interval, 18 – 24 weeks).
In a population pharmacokinetic assessment of Phase I, II and III clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer, the estimated mean AUC was 578 mg day/ L and the estimated mean peak and trough concentrations were 110 mg/ L and 66 mg/ L, respectively.
In patients with early breast cancer administered Herceptin at a loading dose of 8 mg/ kg followed every three weeks by 6 mg/ kg, steady state trough concentrations of 63 mg/ L were achieved by cycle 13 (week 37).
The concentrations were comparable to those reported previously in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Clearance Clearance decreased with increased dose level.
In clinical trials where a loading dose of 4 mg/ kg trastuzumab followed by a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg/ kg was used, the mean clearance was 0.225L/ day.
The effects of patient characteristics (such as age or serum creatinine) on the disposition of trastuzumab have been evaluated.
The data suggest that the disposition of trastuzumab is not altered in
20 any of these groups of patients (see 4.2), however, studies were not specifically designed to investigate the impact of renal impairment upon pharmacokinetics.
Volume of Distribution In all clinical studies, volume of distribution approximated serum volume, 2.95 L.
Circulating Shed Antigen Detectable concentrations of the circulating extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor (shed antigen) are found in the serum of some patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancers.
Determination of shed antigen in baseline serum samples revealed that 64% (286/ 447) of patients had detectable shed antigen, which ranged as high as 1880 ng/ ml (median = 11 ng/ ml).
Patients with higher baseline shed antigen levels were more likely to have lower serum trough concentrations of trastuzumab.
However, with weekly dosing, most patients with elevated shed antigen levels achieved target serum concentrations of trastuzumab by week 6 and no significant relationship has been observed between baseline shed antigen and clinical response.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
There was no evidence of acute or multiple dose-related toxicity in studies of up to 6 months, or reproductive toxicity in teratology, female fertility or late gestational toxicity/ placental transfer studies.
Herceptin is not genotoxic.
A study of trehalose, a major formulation excipient did not reveal any toxicities.
No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of Herceptin, or to determine its effects on fertility in males.

PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS
6.1 List of excipients
L-histidine hydrochloride L-histidine α ,α -trehalose dihydrate polysorbate 20
6.2 Incompatibilities
Do not dilute with glucose solutions since these cause aggregation of the protein.
Herceptin should not be mixed or diluted with other products except those mentioned under section 6.6.
6.3 Shelf life
4 years
After reconstitution with sterile water for injections the reconstituted solution is physically and chemically stable for 48 hours at 2°C – 8°C.
Any remaining reconstituted solution should be discarded.
Solutions of Herceptin for infusion are physically and chemically stable in polyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene bags containing 0.9% sodium chloride for 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30°C.
From a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Herceptin infusion solution should be used immediately.
The product is not intended to be stored after reconstitution and dilution
21 unless this has taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.
6.4 Special precautions for storage
Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C)
Do not freeze the reconstituted solution.
6.5 Nature and contents of container
Herceptin vial:
One 15 ml clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film.
Each carton contains one vial.
6.6 Special Precautions for disposal
Preparation for Administration Appropriate aseptic technique should be used.
Each vial of Herceptin is reconstituted with 7.2 ml of sterile water for injections (not supplied).
Use of other reconstitution solvents should be avoided.
This yields a 7.4 ml solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/ ml trastuzumab, at a pH of approximately 6.0.
A volume overage of 4% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial.
Herceptin should be carefully handled during reconstitution.
Causing excessive foaming during reconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Herceptin may result in problems with the amount of Herceptin that can be withdrawn from the vial.
Instructions for Reconstitution:
1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.2 ml of sterile water for injections in the vial containing the lyophilised Herceptin, directing the stream into the lyophilised cake.
2) Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution.
DO NOT SHAKE!
Slight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual.
Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes.
The reconstituted Herceptin results in a colourless to pale yellow transparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates.
Determine the volume of the solution required: • based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/ kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg trastuzumab/ kg body weight:
Volume (ml) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/ kg for loading or 2 mg/ kg for maintenance) 21 (mg/ ml, concentration of reconstituted solution) • based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/ kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of 6 mg trastuzumab/ kg body weight:
Volume (ml) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/ kg for loading or 6 mg/ kg for maintenance) 21 (mg/ ml, concentration of reconstituted solution)
The appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to an infusion bag containing 250 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
Do not use with glucose-containing solutions (see 6.2).
The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming.
Parenteral solutions should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to administration.
Once the infusion is prepared it should be administered immediately.
If diluted aseptically, it may be stored for 24 hours (do not store above 30°C).
22 No incompatibilities between Herceptin and polyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene bags have been observed.

WHAT HERCEPTIN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Each pack of Herceptin contains one vial.
This vial contains a white to pale yellow lyophilised (“ freeze-dried”) powder for concentrate for solution for infusion.
The lyophilised powder must be reconstituted and diluted before use.
Herceptin contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a humanised monoclonal antibody.
This is similar to the antibodies produced naturally by the body which protect it against infections with viruses and bacteria.
Monoclonal antibodies are proteins which specifically recognise and bind to other unique proteins in the body called antigens.
Trastuzumab binds selectively to an antigen called human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2).
HER2 is found in large amounts on the surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth.
When Herceptin binds to HER2 it stops the growth of such cells.
Herceptin is prescribed by doctors for the treatment of patients with early breast cancer, where it is used after you have finished your chemotherapy, and for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer (i. e., breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) who have tumours that produce large amounts of HER2.
It is used alone in conditions where other treatments proved unsuccessful.
It is also used in combination with the chemotherapy agents paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer.
It is also used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.
If you receive Herceptin with paclitaxel, docetaxel or an aromatase inhibitor you should also read the package inserts for these products.

BEFORE YOU USE HERCEPTIN
Do not use Herceptin
- If you are allergic to trastuzumab, to murine (mouse) proteins, or to any of the other ingredients.
- If you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen
treatment.
32 Take special care with Herceptin
- If you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease or high blood pressure.
This is because
Herceptin can cause heart failure.
- If you have ever had chemotherapy with a drug called doxorubicin or a drug related to
doxorubicin (your doctor can advise you here).
These drugs can damage heart muscle and increase the risk of heart problems with Herceptin.
- If you are breathless.
Herceptin can cause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given.
This could be more serious if you are already breathless.
Apart from breathing difficulties, Herceptin can cause fever, chills, flu-like symptoms, swelling of the face and lips, rash, wheezing, heart rhythm disturbances and blood pressure changes.
These effects mainly occur with the first infusion and during the first few hours after the start of the infusion.
Occasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins.
Sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later.
If either of these happens to you, contact your doctor immediately.
You will therefore be observed by a health care professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first infusion and for two hours after the start of other infusions.
If you develop a reaction, they will slow down or stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects.
Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment have died when they are given Herceptin.
Your doctor will closely supervise your therapy with Herceptin.
Treatment with Herceptin may affect the heart.
Therefore, your heart function will be checked before and during the treatment with Herceptin.
If you develop any signs of heart failure (i. e., inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), you may have to stop Herceptin.
It may take up to 6 months for Herceptin to be removed from the body.
Therefore, you should tell your doctor or pharmacist that you have had Herceptin if you start any new medication in the 6 months after stopping treatment.
Taking other medicines:
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist that you have had Herceptin if you start any medication in the 6 months after stopping treatment with Herceptin.
Use in children and adolescents At present, Herceptin is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years because there is not enough information in this age group.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Before starting treatment, you must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, if you think you are pregnant or if you intend to become pregnant.
In rare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing foetus within the amniotic sac has been observed in pregnant women receiving Herceptin.
Your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Herceptin during pregnancy.
Do not breast-feed your baby during Herceptin therapy and for 6 months after the last dose of Herceptin.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine
Driving and using machines
33 We do not know whether Herceptin could affect your ability to drive a car or operate machinery.
However, if you experience symptoms, such as chills or fever, during an infusion of Herceptin (see 4.), you should not drive or use machines until these symptoms disappear.
3.
HOW TO USE HERCEPTIN
Dosage and frequency of administration Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you.
The dose of Herceptin depends on your body weight.
The number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the treatment.
Your doctor will discuss this with you.
For early breast cancer, Herceptin is given every 3 weeks.
The intravenous infusion (“ drip”) will be given over approximately 90 minutes.
For metastic breast cancer, Herceptin is given once a week.
It is given as an intravenous infusion (“ drip”) by a health care professional.
The first dose is given over 90 minutes.
The subsequent doses may be given over 30 minutes.
You will also be observed for some time at the end of each infusion (see 2. under “ Take special care with Herceptin”).
Alternatively for metastatic breast cancer, Herceptin can also be given every 3 weeks.
The intravenous infusion (“ drip”) will be given over approximately 90 minutes.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Herceptin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Some of these side effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation.
During a Herceptin infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur.
These are very common (more than 10 out of 100 patients).
They mainly occur with the first infusion and are temporary.
Other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing difficulties, wheezing, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart fluttering or irregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired.
These symptoms can be serious and some patients have died (see 2. under “ Take special care with Herceptin”).
You will be observed by a health professional during and after each infusion.
If you develop a reaction, they will slow down or stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects.
The infusion may be continued after the symptoms improve.
Other side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Herceptin, not just related to an infusion.
Heart problems can sometimes occur and can be serious.
They include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to heart failure, inflammation of the lining around the heart (pericarditis), and heart rhythm disturbances.
Your doctor will monitor your heart regularly during treatment but you should tell your doctor immediately if you notice breathlessness (including breathlessness at night), cough, fluid retention (swelling) in the legs or arms, or palpitations (heart fluttering or irregular heart beat).
Other very common side effects of Herceptin, occurring in more than 10 out of 100 patients, are: diarrhoea, weakness, skin rashes, chest pain, abdominal pain, joint pain, and muscle pain.
Other common side effects of Herceptin, occurring in less than 10 out of 100 patients, are: allergic reactions, abnormal blood counts (anaemia, low platelet count and low white blood count), constipation, heartburn (dyspepsia), infections, including bladder and skin infections, shingles, inflammation of the breast, inflammation of the pancreas or liver, kidney disorders, increased muscle tone / tension (hypertonia), tremor, numbness or tingling of the fingers and toes, nail disorders, hair loss, inability to sleep (insomnia), sleepiness (somnolence), nose bleeds, acne, itchiness, dry mouth
34 and skin, dry or watery eyes, sweating, feeling weak and unwell, anxiety, depression, abnormal thinking, dizziness, loss of appetite, weight loss, altered taste, asthma, lung disorders, back pain, neck pain, bone pain, leg cramps, haemorrhoids (piles), bruises and arthritis.
Some of the side effects you experience may be due to your underlying breast cancer.
If you receive Herceptin in combination with chemotherapy, some of them may also be due to the chemotherapy.
If you experience any of the side effects mentioned in this leaflet or notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.

This leaflet was last approved in
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) web site: http: / /www. emea. europa. eu/
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only
Always keep this medicine in the closed original pack at a temperature of 2 - 8°C in a refrigerator.
A vial of Herceptin reconstituted with sterile water for injections (not supplied) is stable for 48 hours at 2
- 8°C after reconstitution and must not be frozen.
Appropriate aseptic technique should be used.
Each vial of Herceptin is reconstituted with 7.2 ml of sterile water for injections (not supplied).
Use of other reconstitution solvents should be avoided.
This yields a 7.4 ml solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/ ml trastuzumab.
A volume overage of 4% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each vial.
Herceptin should be carefully handled during reconstitution.
Causing excessive foaming during reconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Herceptin may result in problems with the amount of Herceptin that can be withdrawn from the vial.
Instructions for Reconstitution:
1) Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject 7.2 ml of sterile water for injections in the vial containing the lyophilised Herceptin, directing the stream into the lyophilised cake.
2) Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution.
DO NOT SHAKE!
Slight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual.
Allow the vial to stand undisturbed for approximately 5 minutes.
The reconstituted Herceptin results in a colourless to pale yellow transparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates.
Determine the volume of the solution required: • based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/ kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly dose of 2 mg trastuzumab/ kg body weight:
Volume (ml) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/ kg for loading or 2 mg/ kg for maintenance) 21 (mg/ ml, concentration of reconstituted solution)
•
based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly dose of 6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight:
Volume (ml) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance) 21 (mg/ml, concentration of reconstituted solution)
The appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial and added to a polyvinylchloride, polyethylene or polypropylene infusion bag containing 250 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
Do not use with glucose-containing solutions.
The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming.
Parenteral solutions should be inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to administration.
Once the infusion is prepared it should be
37 administered immediately.
If diluted aseptically, it may be stored for 24 hours (do not store above 30°C).
