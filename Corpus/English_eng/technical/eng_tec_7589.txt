EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ONSIOR
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Onsior?
Onsior contains robenacoxib which belongs to a class of medicines that reduce fever, pain and inflammation.
It is available as tablets in five different strengths (6 mg for cats, and 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg for dogs) and as a solution for injection (20 mg/ ml for dogs and cats).
What is Onsior used for?
In cats, Onsior tablets are used for the treatment of acute pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders (problems with the muscles and bones).
The solution for injection is used for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with surgery of the soft tissues, such as neutering.
In dogs, Onsior tablets are used for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with chronic osteoarthritis (a long-term disease causing pain in the joints).
The solution for injection is used for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with orthopaedic (bone) or soft tissue surgery.
The tablets are given once a day at the same time every day, at a dose of 1 mg per kilogramme body weight with a range of 1-2 mg/ kg.
Treatment in cats is limited to six days.
Dogs should be treated for as long as is needed.
The solution for injection is given to cats or dogs around 30 minutes before the start of the operation at a dose of 2 mg/ kg.
How does Onsior work?
The active substance in Onsior, robenacoxib, belongs to a class of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
It works by blocking an enzyme called cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2).
This enzyme is involved in producing substances called prostaglandins, which are involved in pain and inflammation.
By blocking the production of prostaglandins, robenacoxib reduces the pain and inflammation caused by musculoskeletal disorders, surgery or osteoarthritis.

How has Onsior been studied?
Onsior has been studied in laboratory animals, as well as ‘ clinical studies ’ in cats and dogs that were treated in veterinary practices and clinics across Europe.
In the clinical studies, Onsior was compared with other veterinary medicines containing NSAIDs (ketoprofen, meloxicam or carprofen).
The studies involved cats and dogs of different age groups, genders and breeds.
The tablets were studied over five to six days in cats with acute musculoskeletal disorders and for up to one year in dogs with osteoarthritis.
The animals received the tablets once or twice a day.
The effectiveness was determined based on examinations by a veterinarian and assessments by the animal’ s owner.
The solution for injection was studied in cats and dogs undergoing surgery.
Pain was assessed by the veterinarian for up to 24 hours after treatment, based on the animal’ s behaviour and responses to touching the inflamed area or moving the affected joint.
What benefit has Onsior shown during the studies?
Onsior tablets given once a day reduced pain and improved mobility in both cats and dogs.
Onsior was as effective as the comparator NSAIDs.
The solution for injection caused a gradual decrease in pain scores in cats and dogs after the operation.
After the end of the operation, sufficient pain control was seen up to 24 hours in dogs and up to 22 hours in cats.
Onsior was as effective as the comparator NSAIDs.
What is the risk associated with Onsior?
The side effects of Onsior are similar to those seen with other NSAIDs.
The most common side effects of the tablets and solution for injection are mild and transient effects on the stomach and gut, seen as vomiting, soft faeces and diarrhoea.
In 1% to 10% of dogs, there was an increase in liver enzymes after long-term treatment with the tablets.
The solution for injection can also cause pain on injection.
For a full list of all side effects reported with Onsior, see the Package Leaflet.
Onsior tablets must not be used in dogs or cats with existing problems affecting the stomach and gut, such as stomach ulcers or bleeding, or in dogs with liver problems.
It must not be used in animals that are pregnant, nursing puppies or kittens or being used for breeding, or that are hypersensitive (allergic) to robenacoxib or any of the other ingredients.
Care should be taken when treating cats or dogs with known heart or kidney problems and cats with liver problems.
Onsior must not be used with other NSAIDs or with glucocorticosteroids.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
Wash your hands after you have administered the medicine to a dog or cat.
In case of accidental ingestion of the tablets, in particular by small children, or self-injection with the solution for injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the Package Leaflet or the label to the doctor.
For pregnant women, particularly those in the later stages of pregnancy, accidental ingestion or self-injection of Onsior might be dangerous for the unborn child.
