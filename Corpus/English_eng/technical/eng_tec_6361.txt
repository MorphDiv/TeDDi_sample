Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.
