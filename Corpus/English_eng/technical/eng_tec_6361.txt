Using & amarok;
& amarok; is a versatile audio player that offers many different ways of controlling your music collection. Like any ordinary audio player, & amarok; has a player window for controlling your most basic functions. & amarok; also has a playlist that is second to none. The playlist window has multiple browsers for creating and browsing your entire audio collection.
In this chapter we will go over how to use all the features of & amarok; including creating a collection and a playlist.
The Player Window
Player Window Screenshot
The player window is your one click & amarok; control center. At the top of the player there is a scrolling display to show the currently playing track or stream. Just below the scrolling display there is an area to display the current track's play time, bit rate, and sample rate. Clicking this area will change the track time from total played to total time remaining.
The player window also features a selection of audio analyzers also located under the scrolling display. You can cycle through the available analyzers by left clicking the analyzer area.
Analyzer Tip
The & amarok; player analyzers can be detached from the player window. By pressing D on your keyboard the active analyzer will open in an independent, re-sizeable window.
Also below the scrolling display are the PL and EQ buttons. The PL button is used to quickly enable or disable the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to enable and disable the equalizer if your engine is compatible.
The remainder of the player includes the playback buttons and the volume and track position sliders. Use the sliders to choose a track position or volume level that suits your needs. Use the playback buttons to control the playback of the current track, or to skip either forward or back through your tracks.
The Equalizer Window
The built in equalizer is easy to use and works with all engines. There are 17 presets included, ranging from Classical to Techno, and you can easily create your own.
To access the equalizer choose Tools Equalizer from the main window or click the EQ button from the Player window. Once you check the Enable Equalizer check box in this window, the equalizer will be active.
Equalizer Screenshot
You can use the dialog's drop down box to select one of the built in presets. You can also adjust individual sliders here. Adjusting a slider will automatically cause a switch to the Manual preset so feel free to experiment with them until you find a desirable combination. When you are ready to save, click the Add new preset icon to the right of the drop down box. If you change to another preset without saving your changes they will be lost. In addition to saving you can also click the Manage presets icon, to the right of the drop down box, to delete or rename presets.
The Playlist Window
Playlist Window Screenshot
The & amarok; playlist is the most advanced playlist available to any audio player for & kde;. The playlist offers many features that are not found in any other player. You should not be intimidated by the power of the playlist however, as it is still the easiest to use.
The playlist window can be divided into two main sections, on the left is the sidebar. The sidebar is where you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist like the Context Browser. On the right side of the window is the playlist itself. The playlist is simple to use yet powerful enough for even the most advanced users.
The Sidebar Browsers
Browsers in & amarok; allow you to access your music collection in several different ways. They are situated on the left side of the window, and each one is represented by a tab with its name written on it. Clicking on a tab brings the selected browser into view. If a browser is active clicking on its tab again will contract the browser. Only one browser is visible at any time, although you can drag tracks from one tab to another by hovering on the target tab for 1 second until that tab becomes visible. You can also hide browsers by simply right-clicking on any tab and (un)selecting the desired browser(s) in the provided context menu.
Browser Selection Screenshot
Context Browser
The Context Browser displays various information related to the currently playing track. Its appearance can be modified by using themes known as Context Browser Styles. It is organized into three tabs: Music, Lyrics, and Artist. These tabs, whose function will be more fully explained below, supply information on different aspects the track currently being listened to.
Users of previous & amarok; versions will notice that there is no longer a Home tab. The information from this tab has been redistributed throughout the & amarok; interface. Analogous information can be found mainly in the Statistics dialog, accessible through Tools Statistics.
Context Screenshot
The Music Tab
The Music tab offers information about the currently playing track, and it's artist and album.
The first pane in this tab is for information about the track. The title of the pane lists the track name, artist name, and album. Inside the pane you will find it shows the album cover image for the track. Next to the image you will find a MusicBrainz icon. Click this icon to do a MusicBrainz look-up for the track.
Below the MusicBrainz icon there is more information about you current track. Here you will find the total number of times the track has been played, the track's current score, and when the track was first and last played.
To display album cover images in the Context Browser you must have the album cover image in the same directory as the track you are listening to. Supported file formats are. jpg,. jpeg,. gif, and. png. The images can be named anything, but images with the word front in the filename will be used with preference. The Context Browser will also use cover images saved from the album cover downloader, or images embedded in ID3v2 tags.
The next pane, Suggested Songs, lists multiple tracks for suggested listening. Click on any of the listed tracks to begin playback of the track.
Below Suggested Songs is the Favorite Tracks By Artist. This pane lists the five highest rated tracks by the current track's artist.
You can adjust the amount of information shown in the Music tab by right-clicking anywhere on Music tab and toggling items on the context menu.
The last pane, Albums By Artists, lists all of the albums by the current track's artists that are in your collection. Clicking on any of the albums in this pane will expand the album to show the album's content.
You can click on tracks in any of the panes to begin playback of the track. You can also right click albums and tracks for a pop-up menu to choose several ways to play or enqueue the track or album.
The Lyrics Tab
Lyrics tabs fetches lyrics for the currently played song from one of the supported websites. This feature is flexible, and it's possible to write scripts to fetch lyrics from different sites. See Chapter on Script-Writing. When you click on the Lyrics tab, & amarok; attempts to fetch lyrics for the current track. If there is no lyrics script running you will be given the opportunity to select one.
Lyrics Screenshot
You can perform various actions on the lyrics tab, using its toolbar buttons.
The Add button opens (in an external browser) the Add Lyrics page on the lyrics website, depending on which script you run.
The Edit button allows you to edit lyrics for the current track. They are then stored in & amarok; 's collection database. This does not require a lyrics script to be active.
The Search button launches a google. com search (in an external browser) for the lyrics of the current track.
The Refresh button clears cached lyrics for current track, and searches again.
Open in external browser displays the current track's lyrics in your external browser.
The Artist Tab
Artist Tab Screenshot
The Artist tab shows Wikipedia article about currently played artist. Toolbar contains:
Navigational buttons for moving forward or backward
Page buttons for jumping to artist's, album's or track's Wikipedia page,
A button for opening current page in external browser
A configuration button for setting the Wikipedia locale
Collection Browser
Collection Browser Screenshot
The Collection browser is the heart of & amarok;. The entire collection is viewable here and sorted using various groupings. Within each grouping, everything is always alphabetical, symbols and numbers first, and case insensitive. In every grouping method, tracks that have unknown artists and/ or albums are always grouped at the start of your collection, under Unknown. Although track numbers are not shown, tracks are listed in their album order. Clicking the header of the collection list reverses the sort order. Left-clicking on the expand icon to the left of any entry in your collection will expand that entry.
The Group By pull-down menu allows you to group your collection in several ways:
Group By Artist - Top level sort only, every track is grouped under its artist, with no consideration given to albums or genres.
Group By Artist/ Album - Tracks are sorted into artists, and then beneath this, sorted by album. If you want to see compilation or soundtrack albums, this is the best way to view your collection - these albums are grouped together at the very begin of your list, under Various Artists.
Group By Artist/ Year-Album - Sorts by artist, with albums in descending order of year (most recent first). If there is no Year tag set for a track, the default 0 - album name.
Group By Album - Every album in your collection is displayed alphabetically based on the album name, regardless of artist.
Group By Genre/ Artist - Tracks are grouped according to their genre tag, then by artist.
Group By Genre/ Artist/ Album - Same as above, only with tracks sorted by album, below each artist.
The remaining items on the pulldown menu allow you to customise the grouping with any combination of the above.
The next two icons on the toolbar change the way your collection is viewed. The first, Tree View, is the default view, and the one you'll probably see the most. The next button enables Flat View, which at first appears empty. Typing search terms in the text entry box immediately below the toolbar will begin to populate your collection, which can be sorted in a variety of ways, by left-clicking on the column headers. Right-clicking on the column headers will pop up a context menu allowing you to change the columns shown.
The last icon in the toolbar lets you change your collection setup. Note that if you change any folders, & amarok; will automatically rescan your collection - this may take quite some time if you have many tracks.
Immediately below the toolbar is a search filter, which behaves the same in both Flat and Tree views. See the Playlist section of the handbook for more details on searching techniques.
Below the Search Filter, another pull-down menu lets you see the most recently added tracks to your collection. Several time periods are available, ranging from the last 24 hours, to 1 year, or your entire collection.
The Collection Browser & RMB; Options
The following options are accessible by clicking with the & RMB; on entries in the collection browser.
Load - Clears the current playlist and adds selected track(s) as first track(s), in sort order.
Append to Playlist - Adds selected track(s) to end of current playlist. Double clicking on a single track in the collection also achieves the same result.
Queue Tracks - Adds the selected track(s) to the queue as the next to be played.
Save as Playlist - Save the selected tracks as a playlist. You'll be prompted for a name to save as.
Add to Media Device Transfer Queue - Adds track(s) to a queue, ready to be transferred to a media device, when such a device is attached. See Media Device Browser section for more detail.
Burn All Tracks By This Artist/ Burn To CD - Sends track(s) to & k3b; for burning as either a data or Audio CD. If & k3b; is not installed, this option is not selectable.
Fetch Cover Image - Searches amazon. com for a cover image for this album.
Edit Information for (n) Tracks - Opens the Track Information dialog and allows you to change tags for one or more tracks.
Manage Files
Organize (n) Files - Opens Organize Collection Files dialog.
Delete (n) Files - Pops up a confirmation dialog asking whether you want to permanently delete the selected track(s) from your computer.
Mark As Compilation - Sets the selected album as a compilation album, to be listed under Various Artists
Unmark As Compilation - Changes an album marked as a compilation to a normal album, and moves the listing from Various Artists, to back under the artists listed.
Playlist Browser
Playlist Browser Screenshot
The Playlist Browser is used for easy handling of your multiple playlists. The Playlist Browser also features built in smart playlists making it the most clever playlist browser around.
The Playlist Browser is divided into two sections, Playlists and Smart Playlists. The Playlists sections is for your own custom playlists. You can view the contents of your playlists in a list view by clicking the + symbol found next to each of the listed playlists. When you view a playlist in the list view new items can be added to the playlist by dragging and dropping them into the view. When you have found a playlist that you would like to load, you can double click the playlist, or press the Space Bar to have & amarok; load it. The other Playlist Browser keyboard shortcuts can be found in the Keyboard Shortcuts section.
When you save a new playlist from the Playlist Window it is automatically added to the Playlist section.
The bottom section of the Playlist Browser is the Smart Playlists. The Smart Playlists use & amarok; 's built in data base to compile some useful playlists on the fly. The Smart Playlists include the following:
All Collection: a playlist with all the tracks that are in your configured collection.
Favorite Tracks: multiple playlists of the fifteen highest rated tracks in a listview by artitst.
Most Played: multiple playlists of the fifteen most played tracks in a listview by artitst.
Newest Tracks: multiple playlists of the fifteen most recently added tracks in a listview by artitst.
Last Played: a playlist of the fifteen most recently played tracks in your collection.
Never Played: a playlist of the tracks in your collection which have never been played before.
Genres: multiple playlists in a listview ordered by genre.
User defined smart playlists are also possible. Clicking the Create Smart-Playlist button will open a dialog to configure a smart playlist to fit your criteria.
Media Device Browser
Media Device Browser Screenshot
The Media Device panel is used for connecting your iPod, to & amarok;. To use your iPod with the Media Device browser you must have your iPod mounted at / mnt/ ipod before starting & amarok;. Once you have started & amarok; you will find the tracks on your iPod listed by artist in a listview at the top of the browser.
To add tracks to your iPod, drag the tracks you want to add from the playlist and drop them on the Artist listview. After you are done adding tracks to the list click the Transfer button to upload them to your iPod. After the transfer has completed, close & amarok; and unmount your iPod.
File Browser
File Browser Screenshot
The File Browser panel is like a mini konqueror embedded into the playlist. You can use the File Browser panel to browse your entire filesystem for audio files to add to the playlist. At the top of the File Browser you will find a toolbar with navigation buttons for moving Up, Back, and Forward through your filesystem. The tool bar also offers a Home, Reload, Short view and Detailed view buttons, it also features a Bookmarks button for creating bookmarks of your favorite filesystem areas.
Below the toolbar is a handy search bar for searching by file name. You will find the search bar useful for directories with many files as it searches as you type leaving only the relevant file names in the view.
At the bottom of the File Browser is an address bar for accessing your music from any URL that you type. For instance typing tar: / home/ mike/ music. tar. gz into the address bar and pressing & Enter; on your keyboard will allow you to access the files inside the music tar ball. Now you can drag the audio from the tar ball and drop it into the playlist.
When playlist grows larger than one screenful, it becomes hard to append files by simply dropping them. Holding & Shift; key on keyboard while dropping may help in this case: the files will be appended at the end of playlist rather than inserted at current drop position.
The Playlist
Playlist Screenshot
The Playlist holds all the tracks you have en-queued for playing. You can change the sequence by dragging items around with the mouse, and dropping them in the desired position. Above the Playlist you see a Text Box, where you can enter a filter string. As soon as you enter a letter there, the Playlist will be redisplayed, showing only entries containing the entered characters. To stop the filtering, simply press & Backspace;, until the filter is empty.
Advanced, Google-esque syntax is also available.
By default, when you enter terms separated by spaces, it will search for items containing all of them. For example: one two three, will search for anything that contains one, two, and three.
However, you can put OR between terms to search for items that contain either, like this: one OR two OR three. That way, it will search for items that contain either one, or two, or three (or a combination of them).
You can also use quotes to search for terms with spaces in them: "Mike Oldfield". That will search for items that contain Mike Oldfield, but not, for example, ones that contain Mike J. Oldfield.
By default, it searches in all the columns of the playlist that are currently visible. However, you can use column: term to specify the column to search in: title: amarok (this can also be a column that is n't visible). This way, it will only search for items that have the word amarok in the title, and not, for example, in the album.
When specifying a specific column to search in, you can also search for items less than or greater than a term, for example: score: > 50, which will search for items with a score greater than 50.
To specify a term you do n't want the items to match, you can put a minus (-) sign before them: -thing, to search for anything that does n't contain thing.
You can combine the above at will, for example: "Mike Oldfield" OR score: > 50 -comment: bad. That will search for anything that either contains Mike Oldfield or has a score greater than 50, but excludes items where the comment contains "bad".
Playlist Tip
You can select items to be played in a specific order by holding & Ctrl; and clicking the & RMB; on items in the order in which you wish them to be played. The items will be tagged with a number showing the order in which you selected them.

The cover manager provides a listview of all the albums in your collection. You can view all of your album covers for an artist by clicking on the artist in the list view.
The cover manager provides a search bar for searching in your album covers. The cover manager will search your albums for the search criteria you type in the search bar.
The View menu allows you to choose what is displayed in the cover manager. You can choose from:
All albums which displays all your albums in your collection.

The Queue Manager
Queue Manager Screenshot
The Queue Manager makes it's grand entrance in & amarok; 1.3. This feature is designed to enable users to have even more control over their playlists. After queuing, a track a number will be shown beside it in the Queue Manager. This number indicates the order in which & amarok; will play the track: one will be first, two will be second, and so on.
You can use the Queue Manager by opening it from Tools Queue Manager, selecting the track, and then pressing the + icon in the Queue Manager. You can also just drag tracks to the Queue Manager to create a queue. Alternatively, the playlist's context menu may also be used and the Queue Manager can then be opened in order to modify the order.
Dynamic Playlists
What Are They?
Dynamic Playlists are self-generating playlists, created according to defined rules, which are used to keep the current playlist to a manageable size. Whilst & amarok; is fairly light on resources while running, loading a large number of tracks into a playlist at once increases RAM usage, possibly impacting on system performance, which is avoided completely by using Dynamic Playlists. Also known as Party Mode, they are also a great way to keep the music playing all night with no interaction.
Where Are They?
You can find Dynamic Playlists in the Playlists Sidebar.
Playlist Sidebar
Playlist Sidebar
There are three types of Dynamic Playlists, referred to as Dynamic Modes, two of which are predefined (more details on configuring this later).
Random Mix
Initialises a playlist with random tracks from you're entire collection, and keeps adding random tracks.
Suggested Songs
Adds tracks based on last. fm (formerly audioscrobbler) suggestions. Requires some tracks already in the playlist. Note you do not need a last. fm profile for this to work.
Playlist Shuffle (user-created)
Adds random tracks from specified Smart Playlists, either built-in or user defined.
How Do I Use Them?
Simply double-click your desired playlist, drag it to the playlist window, or right-click and select Load. This will replace your current playlist, so you may want to save that first if it's important to you.
Both Random Mix and Playlist Shuffle will populate your playlist and allow you to start playing immediately. Suggested Songs will start with an empty playlist, requiring you to add at least one song from your collection manually. The suggestions are added on a track change, so your playlist will not be populated until the end of the first song.
If you wish to retain your current playlist, you can enable the last type of Dynamic Mode used by selecting Settings Dynamic Mode. This will use your existing playlist as a starting point. You can disable Dynamic Mode via the same menu option.
Dynamic Playlist loaded
