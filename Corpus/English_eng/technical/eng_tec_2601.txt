(PHP 3 = 3.0.8, PHP 4)
dba_fetch() fetches the data specified by key from the database specified with handle.
Key is the key the data is specified by.
Skip is the number of key-value pairs to ignore when using cdb databases.
This value is ignored for all other databases which do not support multiple keys with the same name.
Handle is a database handle returned by dba_open().
dba_fetch() returns the associated string or FALSE, if the key / data pair is found or not found, respectively.
See also: dba_exists(), dba_delete(), dba_insert(), and dba_replace().
Note:
The skip parameter is available since PHP 4.3 to support cdb 's capability of multiple keys having the same name.
