If this checkbox is enabled and the imported photo contains an Exif orientation tag, the image data will be physically transformed (losslessly) so that the viewed image looks the same as before but the orientation tag is reset to "top left". If this checkbox is not enabled, the image data and the orientation tag are both left unchanged. The image will be displayed identically by gthumb for both possibilities, but for maximum compatibility with other applications this checkbox should be enabled.

This checkbox governs the rotation method used for JPEG images that contain Exif orientation tags. If this checkbox is enabled, the rotation will be performed using a physical transform, and the Exif orientation tag will be reset to the default "top left" value. If it is not enabled, the rotation will be performed by changing the Exif orientation tag only. For maximum compatibility with other applications, this checkbox should be enabled.

Problem transforming the image: %s
This transformation may introduce small image distortions along one or more edges, because the image dimensions are not multiples of 8.

The distortion is reversible, however. If the resulting image is unacceptable, simply apply the reverse transformation to return to the original image.

You can also choose to discard (or trim) any untransformable edge pixels. For practical use, this mode gives the best looking results, but the transformation is not strictly lossless anymore.
