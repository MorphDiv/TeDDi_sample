Highlight
The Highlight slider controls the strength of the highlight that will appear on the edges of each piece. You may compare it to the "glossiness" of the material the puzzle is made of. Highlight width is relative to the Bevel width. As a rule of thumb, the more pieces you add to the puzzle, the lower Bevel and Highlight values you should use, and vice versa. The default values are suitable for a 500x500 pixel image.

IFS Fractal
Fractal Composition
Applying example for the IFS Fractal filter
Filter
This fractal-based plug-in is truly wonderful! With this versatile instrument, you can create amazingly naturalistic organic shapes, like leaves, flowers, branches, or even whole trees. (
The key to use this plug-in lies in making very small and precise movements in fractal space. The outcome is always hard to predict, and you have to be extremely gentle when you change the pattern. If you make a component triangle too big, or if you move it too far (even ever so slightly), the preview screen will black out, or more commonly, you'll get stuck with a big shapeless particle cloud.
A word of advice: When you have found a pattern you want to work with, make only small changes, and stick to variations of that pattern. It's all too easy to lose a good thing. Contrary to what you might believe, it's really much easier to create a leaf or a tree with IFS Fractal than to make a defined geometrical pattern (where you actually know what you're doing, and end up with the pattern you had in mind).
For a brief introduction to IFS's see Foley and van Dam, et al,.
This filter is found in the image window menu under

A Brief Tutorial
This is a rather complex plug-in, so to help you understand it, we'll guide you through an example where you'll create a leaf or branch.
Many forms of life, and especially plants, are built like mathematical fractals, i.e., a shape that reproduces or repeats itself indefinitely into the smallest detail. You can easily reproduce the shape of a leaf or a branch by using four (or more) fractals. Three fractals make up the tip and sides of the leaf, and the fourth represents the stem.
Before invoking the filter: Select
Open IFS Fractal. Start by rotating the right and bottom triangles, so that they point upward. You'll now be able to see the outline of what's going to be the tip and sides of the leaf. (If you have problems, it may help to know that the three vertices of a triangle are not equivalent.)
Tutorial Step 2
Start by rotating triangles 2 and 3, trying to keep them nearly the same size.
To make the leaf symmetrical, adjust the bottom triangle to point slightly to the left, and the right triangle to point slightly to the right.
Press
Tutorial Step 3
Add a fourth component, then stretch, scale, and move it as shown.
You still have to make it look more leaf-like. Increase the size of the top triangle, until you think it's thick and leafy enough. Adjust all fractals until you're happy with the shape. Right-click to get the pop-up menu, and choose
Tutorial Step 4
Enlarge component 1, arrange the other components appropriately, then select all, scale and rotate.
The final step is to adjust color. Click on the
Tutorial Step 5
Assign a brownish color to component 4, and various shades of green to the other components.
Press OK to apply the image, and voilà, you've just made a perfect fractal leaf! Now that you've got the hang of it, you'll just have to experiment and make your own designs. All plant-imitating fractals (be they oak trees, ferns or straws) are more or less made in this fashion, which is leaves around a stem (or several stems). You just have to twist another way, stretch and turn a little or add a few more fractals to get a totally different plant.

Unfortunately it turned out, that this filter is not working properly for large images. Even more unfortunate is, that its developer is currently not undertaking any actions with that plug-in at all, so there seems no quick fix in sight. Although we can't give you the exact numbers, the plug-in worked in a quick test for a 1024x768 pixel image, but didn't do it for a 2500x2500 pixel image.
This plug-in was given to GIMP by Scott Draves in 1997. He also holds the copyright for the plug-in. An descriptive page for the plug-in, provided by the author can be found in the internet

In the main window, you can set Rendering and Camera parameters. The first three parameters in the Render display are Brightness, Contrast and Gamma. The result of these options is visible in the Preview window, but it's generally better to stick to the default values, and correct the rendered image later with Image/Colors.
The other three parameters affect the rendering process and don't show in the preview window. Sample Density, which controls the resolution of the rendered pattern, is the most important of these. The Camera parameters allow you to zoom and offset the flame pattern, until you're happy with what you see in the preview window. Flame also offers the possibility to store and load your favorite patterns.
Edit
Pressing this button brings up the Edit dialog:
The Edit Flame dialog
The dialog shows nine different windows. The pattern displayed in the center is the current pattern, and the eight windows surrounding it are random variations of that pattern. Clicking on the central image creates eight new variations, which can be adjusted with the Speed control. You select a variation by clicking on it, and it instantly replaces the image in the middle. To pick a certain character or theme for the variations, you can choose from nine different themes in the
This button brings up a file selector that allows you to open a previously saved Flame settings file.

Brightness
Controls the brightness of the flame object.
Contrast
Controls the contrast between brighter and dimmer parts of the flame.
Gamma
Sets a gamma correction for parts with intermediate brightness.
Sample density
Controls the resolution of the rendered pattern. (Does not have any effect on the preview.) A high sample density results in soft and smooth rendering (like a spider's web), whereas low density rendering resembles spray or particle clouds.

This filter lets you make diffraction or wave interference textures. You can change the Frequency, Contours and Sharp Edges for each of the RGB channels. You can also set Brightness, Scattering and Polarization of the texture. There is no automatic preview, so you must press the preview button to update. On a slow system, this may take a bit of time. Note that result doesn't depend on the initial image.
This is a very useful filter if you want to create intricate patterns. It's perfect for making psychedelic, batik-like textures, or for imitating patterns in stained glass (as in a church window).
It seems clear that the plugin works by simulating the physics of light striking a grating. Unfortunately, the original authors never got around to writing down the theory behind it, or explaining what the parameters mean. The best approach, then, is just to twiddle things and see what happens. Fortunately, almost anything you do seems to produce interesting results.
