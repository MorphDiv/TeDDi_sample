0.75 VN. U*
* VN. U:
Vironeutralising antibody titre after vaccine injection in guinea pigs.

IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Ibraxion is a gene specific deleted (gE), inactivated and adjuvanted (o/ w emulsion) vaccine which acts by the active immunisation of cattle characterised by the production of Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) vironeutralising antibodies.
The gE gene deletion allows differentiation between animals vaccinated with gE-negative vaccines (anti gE antibody negative, IBR vironeutralising antibody positive) and naturally infected animals (positive to both IBR vironeutralising antibody and anti gE antibody).
Ibraxion can therefore be used as a marker vaccine in association with an appropriate diagnostic test.
5.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
5.1 Target species
Cattle
5.2 Indications for use
Active immunisation of cattle to reduce the clinical signs of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and field virus excretion.
The onset of immunity is 14 days and the duration of immunity is 6 months.
5.3 Contraindications
None
2/ 35 5.4 Undesirable effects (frequency and seriousness)
• The injection of the vaccine may cause a transient tissue reaction at the site of injection, which may persist for three weeks and rarely up to five weeks.
• The vaccination may cause a slight rise in body temperature (less than 1°C) for a transient period (less than 48 hours after injection) without any consequence to the health or performance of the animal.
• A hypersensitivity reaction may occur.
These are rare and an appropriate symptomatic treatment should be administered.
5.5 Special precautions for use
Vaccinate only healthy animals.
Allow the vaccine to reach a temperature of 15°C-25°C.
Use sterile syringes and needles.
5.6 Use during pregnancy and lactation
Ibraxion can be used in pregnant and lactating cows.
5.7 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy from the concurrent use of this vaccine with any other.
It is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered concurrently with the product.
5.8 Posology and method of administration
• Shake well prior to use. • Injection in the neck at the front of the shoulder. • Inject one 2-ml dose of vaccine by subcutaneous route, according to the following regimen:
The presence of maternally derived antibodies against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus may interfere with the vaccination and requires an appropriate vaccination regimen.
Basic vaccination: two injections 21 days apart.
For use in animals from the age of 2 weeks in the absence of maternally derived antibodies against IBR virus or from the age of 3 months in the presence of maternally derived antibodies.
Revaccination:
a booster injection should be administered at 6 month intervals.

No undesirable effects other than those observed and mentioned in the “ Undesirable effects” section have been observed after the administration of an overdose.

Additional information:
Ibraxion is a gene specific deleted (gE), inactivated and adjuvanted (o/ w emulsion) vaccine which acts by the active immunisation of cattle characterised by the production of Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) vironeutralising antibodies.
The gE gene deletion allows differentiation between animals vaccinated with gE-negative vaccines (anti gE antibody negative, IBR vironeutralising antibody positive) and naturally infected animals (positive to both IBR vironeutralising antibody and anti gE antibody).
Ibraxion can therefore be used as a marker vaccine in association with an appropriate diagnostic test.
