(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a valid regular expression which will match string, ignoring case.
This expression is string with each character converted to a bracket expression; this bracket expression contains that character's uppercase and lowercase form if applicable, otherwise it contains the original character twice.
Example 1. sql_regcase() Example
echo sql_regcase ("Foo bar");
[Ff][Oo][Oo] [Bb][Aa][Rr]
This can be used to achieve case insensitive pattern matching in products which support only case sensitive regular expressions.
