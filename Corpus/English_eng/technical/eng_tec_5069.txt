(PHP 4 = 4.1.0)
version_compare() compares two "PHP-standardized "version number strings.
This is useful if you would like to write programs working only on some versions of PHP.
version_compare() returns -1 if the first version is lower than the second, 0 if they are equal, and +1 if the second is lower.
If you specify the third optional operator argument, you can test for a particular relationship.
The possible operators are:, lt, =, le,, gt, =, ge, ==, =, eq, !=,, ne The possible operators are:, lt, =, le,, gt, =, ge, ==, =, eq, !=,, ne respectively.
Using this argument, the function will return 1 if the relationship is the one specified by the operator, 0 otherwise.
Example 1. version_compare() Example
/ / prints -1 echo version_compare( "4.0.4", "4.0.6"); / / these all print 1 echo version_compare("4.0.4", "4.0.6", ""); echo version_compare("4.0.6", "4.0.6", "eq");
