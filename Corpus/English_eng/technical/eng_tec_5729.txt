Popup Menu
Description
The right click popup menu is context-sensitive, meaning its content varies depending on what kind of object you click on. We list all possible popup menu items here, with the relevant object type [in brackets].
[All]
Identification and type: The top one to three lines are devoted to the name(s) of the object, and its type. For stars, the Spectral Type is also shown here.
Rise, Transit, and Set times for the object on the current simulation date are shown on the next three lines.
Center and Track: Center the display on this location, and engage tracking. Equivalent to double-clicking.
Angular Distance To...: Enter "angular distance mode". In this mode, a dotted line is drawn from the first target object to the current mouse position. When you invoke the popup menu of a second object, this item will read Compute Angular Distance. Selecting this item will display the angular distance between the two objects in the statusbar. You can press the & Esc; key to exit angular distance mode without measuring an angle.
Details: Open the Object Details window for this object.
Attach Label: Attach a permanent name label to the object. If the object already has a label attached, this item will read Remove Label.
Show... Image: download an image of the object from the internet, and display it in the Image Viewer tool. The "..." text is replaced by a short description of the image's source. An object may have multiple image links available in its popup menu.
... Page: Display a webpage about the object in your default web browser. The "..." text is replaced by a short description of the page. An object may have multiple web links available in its popup menu.

Customizing
Add Link...: This allows you to add your own custom links to the popup menu of any object. It opens a small window in which you enter the & URL; of the link, and the text you want to appear in the popup menu. There is also a pair of radio buttons which allow you to specify whether the & URL; is an image or an HTML document, so & kstars; knows whether to launch the web browser or the image viewer. You can use this to add links to files on your local disk, so this feature could be used to attach observing logs or other custom information to objects in & kstars;. Your custom links are automatically loaded whenever & kstars; starts up, and they are stored in the folder ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ kstars/, in files myimage_url. dat and myinfo_url. dat. If you build an extensive list of custom links, consider submitting them to us, we would like to include them in the next version of & kstars;!
