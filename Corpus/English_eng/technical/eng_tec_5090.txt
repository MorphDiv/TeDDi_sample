This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
If you would like to define a type for a w32api call, you need to call w32api_deftype().

The first argument is the name of the type.
After that is the type of the member followed by the members name (in pairs).
A member type can be a user defined type.
All the type names are case sensitive.
Built in type names should be provided in lowercase.
