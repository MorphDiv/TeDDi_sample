Window Specific Settings
Here you can constomize window settings specifically only for some windows.
Please note that this configuration will not take effect if you do not use & kwin; as your window manager. If you do use a different window manager, please refer to its documentation for how to customize window behavior.
Many of the settings you can configure here are those you can configure on a global basis in the Window Behavior & systemsettings; module, however some of them are even more detailed.
They encompass geometry, placement, whether a window should be kept above or below others, focus stealing prevention, and translucency settings.
You can access this module in two ways: from the titlebar of the application you wish to configure, or from the & systemsettings;. If you start it from within & systemsettings; you can use the New... to create a window profile, and the Detect Window Properties button on the resulting dialog to partially fill in the required information for the application you wish to configure.
You can also at any time Modify... or Delete any stored settings profile, and reorder the list. Reordering the list using the Move Up and Move Down buttons is a convenience to help you sort the profiles, and has no effect on how they are applied.
