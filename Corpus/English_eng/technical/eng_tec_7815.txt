_Authentication mode:
_Grab mode:


Disable keyboard and mouse grab
Whether the keyboard and mouse grabbing should be turned off. This will make it possible for other X applications to listen to keyboard input events, thus making it not possible to shield from malicious applications which may be running.
Force keyboard and mouse grab
Grab keyboard and mouse even if -g has been passed as argument on the command line.
Sudo mode
Whether sudo should be the default backend method. This method is otherwise accessed though the -S switch or by running 'gksudo' instead of 'gksu'.
Prompt for grabbing
This option will make gksu prompt the user if he wants to have the screen grabbed before entering the password. Notice that this only has an effect if force-grab is disabled.
Display information message when no password is needed
This option determines whether a message dialog will be displayed informing the user that the program is being run without the need of a password being asked for some reason.
Save password to gnome-keyring
gksu can save the password you type to the gnome-keyring so you'll not be asked everytime
Keyring to which passwords will be saved
The name of the keyring gksu should use. Usual values are "session", which saves the password for the session, and "default", which saves the password with no timeout.
Failed to obtain xauth key: xauth binary not found at usual locations
