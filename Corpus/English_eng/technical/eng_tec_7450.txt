CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs and cats.
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
Non-invasive, mildly to moderately painful, procedures and examinations which require restraint, sedation and analgesia in dogs and cats.
Premedication in cats before induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia with ketamine.
Deep sedation and analgesia in dogs in concomitant use with butorphanol for medical and minor surgical procedures.
Premedication in dogs before induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia.

Do not use in animals with severe systemic disease or in animals that are moribund.
Do not use in case of known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
The safety of dexmedetomidine has not been established in males intended for breeding.
In cats, corneal opacities may occur during sedation.
The eyes should be protected by a suitable eye lubricant.
2 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Treated animals should be kept warm and at a constant temperature, both during the procedure and recovery.
The eyes should be protected by a suitable lubricant.
To be used with precaution in elderly animals.
Nervous, aggressive or excited animals should be given the possibility to calm down before initiation of treatment.
Frequent and regular monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function should be performed.
Pulse oximetry may be useful but is not essential for adequate monitoring.
Equipment for manual ventilation should be available in case of respiratory depression or apnoea when dexmedetomidine and ketamine are used sequentially to induce anaesthesia in cats.
It is also advisable to have oxygen readily available, should hypoxaemia be detected or suspected.
Sick and debilitated dogs and cats should only be premedicated with dexmedetomidine before induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia based on a risk-benefit assessment.
Use of dexmedetomidine as a premedicant in dogs significantly reduces the amount of induction drug required for induction of anaesthesia.
Attention should be given during the administration of intravenous induction drugs to effect.
Volatile anaesthetic requirements for maintenance anaesthesia are also reduced.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental oral intake or self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert to the physician but DO NOT DRIVE as sedation and changes in blood pressure may occur.
Avoid skin, eye or mucosal contact; the use of impermeable gloves is advisable.
In case of skin or mucosal contact, wash the exposed skin immediately after exposure with large amounts of water and remove contaminated clothes that are in direct contact with skin.
In case of eye contact, rinse abundantly with fresh water.
If symptoms occur, seek the advice of a physician.
If pregnant women handle the product, special caution should be observed not to self-inject as uterine contractions and decreased foetal blood pressure may occur after accidental systemic exposure.
Advice to doctors:
Dexdomitor is an α 2-adrenoreceptor agonist, symptoms after absorption may involve clinical effects including dose-dependent sedation, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, a dry mouth, and hyperglycaemia.
Ventricular arrhythmias have also been reported.
Respiratory and haemodynamic symptoms should be treated symptomatically.
The specific α 2 – adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole, which is approved for use in animals, has been used in humans only experimentally to antagonize dexmedetomidine-induced effects.
Persons with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients should administer the product with caution.
3 4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
By virtue of its α 2-adrenergic activity, dexmedetomidine causes a decrease in heart rate and body temperature.
Blood pressure will increase initially and then return to normal or below normal.
In some dogs and cats, a decrease in respiratory rate may occur.
Due to peripheral vasoconstriction and venous desaturation in the presence of normal arterial oxygenation, the mucous membranes may appear pale and/ or with a blue tinge.
Rare instances of pulmonary oedema have been reported.
Vomiting may occur 5-10 minutes after injection.
Some dogs and cats may also vomit at the time of recovery.
Muscle tremors may occur during sedation.
Corneal opacities may occur during sedation (see also section 4.5).
When dexmedetomidine and ketamine are used sequentially, with a 10 minute interval, cats may occasionally experience AV-block or extrasystole.
Expected respiratory events are bradypnoea, intermittent respiratory patterns, hypoventilation, and apnoea.
In clinical trials the incidence of hypoxaemia was common, especially within the 15 first minutes into dexmedetomidine-ketamine anaesthesia.
Vomiting, hypothermia and nervousness have been reported after such use.
When dexmedetomidine and butorphanol are used concomitantly in dogs, bradypnoea, tachypnoea, an irregular respiratory pattern (20-30 sec apnoea followed by several rapid breaths), hypoxaemia, muscle twitch or tremor or paddling, excitation, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, urination, skin erythema, a sudden arousal, or prolonged sedation may occur.
Brady- and tachyarrhythmias have been reported.
These may include profound sinus bradycardia, 1st and 2nd degree AV block, sinus arrest or pause, as well as atrial, supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes.
When dexmedetomidine is used as a premedicant in dogs bradypnoea, tachypnoea and vomiting may occur.
Brady- and tachyarrhythmias have been reported and include profound sinus bradycardia, 1st and 2nd degree AV block and sinus arrest.
Supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes, sinus pause and 3rd degree AV block may be observed in rare cases.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of dexmedetomidine has not been established during pregnancy and lactation in the target species.
Therefore the use of the product during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The use of other central nervous system depressants is expected to potentiate the effects of dexmedetomidine and therefore an appropriate dose adjustment should be made.
Anticholinergics should be used with caution with dexmedetomidine.
Administration of atipamezole after dexmedetomidine rapidly reverses the effects and thus shortens the recovery period.
Within 15 minutes dogs are normally awake and standing.
Cats:
After administration of 40 micrograms dexmedetomidine/ kg bw intramuscularly concurrently with 5 mg ketamine/ kg bw to cats, the maximum concentration of dexmedetomidine increased twofold but there was no effect on T max.
The mean half-life of elimination of dexmedetomidine increased to 1.6 h and the total exposure (AUC) increased by 50%.
4 A dose of 10 mg ketamine/ kg used concurrently with 40 micrograms dexmedetomidine/ kg may cause tachycardia.
For information on adverse reactions, see section 4.6. Adverse reactions.
For information on target animal safety in cases of overdosing, see section 4.10. Overdose
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
The product is intended for:
- Dogs: intravenous or intramuscular use
- Cats: intramuscular use
The product is not intended for repeat injections.
Dexdomitor, butorphanol and/ or ketamine can be mixed in the same syringe as they have been shown to be pharmaceutically compatible.
Dosage: the following doses are recommended:
DOGS:
The doses for dogs are based on body surface area.
The intravenous dose is 375 micrograms/ square metre body surface area and the intramuscular dose is 500 micrograms/ square metre body surface area when dexmedetomidine is used as the only agent for sedation and analgesia.
When administering in conjunction with butorphanol (0.1 mg/ kg) for deep sedation and analgesia, the intramuscular dose is 300 micrograms/ square metre body surface area The premedication dose of dexmedetomidine is 125 – 375 micrograms/ square metre body surface area, administered 20 minutes prior to induction for procedures requiring anaesthesia.
The dose should be adjusted to the type of surgery, length of procedure and patient temperament.
Concomitant use of dexmedetomidine and butorphanol produces sedative and analgesic effects beginning no later than 15 minutes.
The peak sedative and analgesic effects are reached within 30 minutes after administration.
Sedation lasts for at least 120 minutes post administration and analgesia lasts for at least 90 minutes.
Spontaneous recovery occurs within 3 hours.
Premedication with dexmedetomidine will significantly reduce the dosage of the induction agent required and will reduce volatile anaesthetic requirements for maintenance anaesthesia.
In a clinical study, the requirement for propofol and thiopental was reduced by 30% and 60% respectively.
All anaesthetic agents used for induction or maintenance of anaesthesia should be administered to effect.
In a clinical study, dexmedetomidine contributed to postoperative analgesia for 0.5 – 4 hours.
However this duration is dependent on a number of variables and further analgesia should be administered in accordance with clinical judgement.
The corresponding doses based on body weight are presented in the following tables.
Use of an appropriately graduated syringe is recommended to ensure accurate dosing when administering small volumes.

The expected sedative and analgesic effects are reached within 15 minutes after administration and are maintained up to 60 minutes after administration.
It is recommended that animals are fasted for 12 hours prior to administration.
Water may be given ad libitum.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Dogs:
In cases of overdosage, or if the effects of dexmedetomidine become potentially life- threatening, the appropriate dose of atipamezole is 10 times the initial dose of dexmedetomidine (micrograms/ kg bw or micrograms/ square meter body surface area).
The dose volume of atipamezole at the concentration of 5 mg/ ml equals the dose volume of Dexdomitor that was given to the dog, regardless of route of administration of Dexdomitor.
Cats:
In cases of overdosage, or if the effects of dexmedetomidine become potentially life-threatening, the appropriate antagonist is atipamezole, administered by intramuscular injection, at the following dose:
5 times the initial dose dexmedetomidine in micrograms/ kg bw.
After concurrent exposure to a triple (3X) overdose of dexmedetomidine and 15 mg ketamine/ kg, atipamezole can be administered at the recommended dose level for reversal of effects induced by dexmedetomidine.
At high serum concentrations of dexmedetomidine sedation is not increased although the level of analgesia does increase with further dose increases.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Not applicable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: psycholeptic, ATCvet code:
QN05CM18.
7 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Dexdomitor contains dexmedetomidine as the active substance, which produces sedation and analgesia in dogs and cats.
The duration and depth of the sedation and analgesia are dose-dependent.
At maximal effect, the animal is relaxed, recumbent and does not respond to external stimulus.
Dexmedetomidine is a potent and selective α 2-adrenoceptor agonist that inhibits the release of noradrenaline from noradrenergic neurons.
Sympathetic neurotransmission is prevented and the level of consciousness decreases.
Reduced heart rate and temporary AV-block can be seen after administration of dexmedetomidine.
Blood pressure decreases to normal or below normal levels after an initial increase.
Respiration rate can occasionally decrease.
Dexmedetomidine also induces a number of other α 2-adrenoceptor mediated effects, which include piloerection, depression of motor and secretory functions of the gastrointestinal tract, diuresis and hyperglycaemia.
A slight decrease in temperature may be observed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
As a lipophilic compound, dexmedetomidine is well absorbed after intramuscular administration.
Dexmedetomidine is also rapidly distributed in the body and penetrates the blood-brain barrier readily.
According to studies in rats, the maximum concentration in the central nervous system is several times that of the corresponding concentration in plasma.
In the circulation, dexmedetomidine is largely bound to plasma proteins (> 90%).
Dogs:
After an intramuscular dose of 50 micrograms/ kg a maximum concentration in plasma of about 12 ng/ ml is reached after 0.6 hours.
The bioavailability of dexmedetomidine is 60% and the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) is 0.9 l/ kg.
The elimination half-life (t½) is 40-50 minutes.
Major biotransformations in the dog include hydroxylation, glucuronic acid conjugation and N-methylation in the liver.
All known metabolites lack pharmacological activity.
Metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine and to a lesser extent in the faeces.
Dexmedetomidine has a high clearance and its elimination depends on the hepatic blood flow.
A prolonged elimination half-life is therefore expected with overdoses or when dexmedetomidine is coadministered with other substances, which affect hepatic circulation.
Cats:
The maximum plasma concentration is reached about 0.24 h after intramuscular administration.
After a 40 micrograms/ kg bw intramuscular dose the Cmax is 17 ng/ ml.
The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) is 2.2 l/ kg and the elimination half-life (t½) is one hour.
Biotransformations in the cat occur by hydroxylation in the liver.
Metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine (51% of the dose), and to a lesser extent in the faeces.
As in dogs dexmedetomidine has a high clearance in cats and its elimination depends on the hepatic blood flow.
A prolonged elimination half-life is therefore expected with overdoses or when dexmedetomidine is coadministered with other substances, which affect hepatic circulation.

CATS:
The dosage for cats is 40 micrograms dexmedetomidine hydrochloride/ kg bw equal to a dose volume 0.08 ml Dexdomitor/ kg bw when used for non-invasive, mildly to moderately painful procedures requiring restraint, sedation and analgesia.
When dexmedetomidine is used for premedication in cats, the same dose is used.
Anaesthesia can be induced 10 minutes after premedication by intramuscular administration of a target dose of 5 mg ketamine/ kg bw.
Dosing for cats is presented in the following table.

SPECIAL STORAGE PRECAUTIONS
Do not freeze.
After withdrawal of the first dose, the product may be stored for 28 days at 25ºC.
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
12.
SPECIAL WARNING(S)
Treated animals should be kept warm and at a constant temperature, both during the procedure and recovery.
Nervous, aggressive or excited animals should be given the possibility to calm down before initiation of treatment.
The safety of dexmedetomidine has not been established during pregnancy and lactation in the target species.
Therefore the use of the product during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended.
The safety of dexmedetomidine has not been established in males intended for breeding.
To be used with precaution in elderly animals.
In cats corneal opacities may occur during sedation.
The eyes should be protected by a suitable eye lubricant.
The use of other central nervous system depressants is expected to potentiate the effects of dexmedetomidine and therefore an appropriate dose adjustment should be made.
Use of dexmedetomidine as a premedicant in dogs significantly reduces the amount of induction drug required for induction of anaesthesia.
Attention should be given during the administration of intravenous induction drugs to effect.
Volatile anaesthetic requirements for maintenance anaesthesia are also reduced.
Anticholinergics should be used with caution with dexmedetomidine.
Cats:
After administration of 40 micrograms dexmedetomidine/ kg bw intramuscularly concurrently with 5 mg ketamine / kg bw to cats, the maximum concentration of dexmedetomidine increased twofold but there was no effect on T max.
The mean half-life of elimination of dexmedetomidine increased to 1.6 h and the total exposure (AUC) increased by 50%.
A dose of 10 mg ketamine/ kg used concurrently with 40 micrograms dexmedetomidine/ kg may cause tachycardia.
22 Administration of atipamezole after dexmedetomidine rapidly reverses the effects and thus shortens the recovery period.
Within 15 minutes dogs are normally awake and standing
For information on adverse reactions, see section Adverse reactions.
Frequent and regular monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function should be performed.
Pulse oximetry may be useful but is not essential for adequate monitoring.
Equipment for manual ventilation should be available in case of respiratory depression or apnoea when dexmedetomidine and ketamine are used sequentially to induce anaesthesia in cats.
It is also advisable to have oxygen readily available, should hypoxaemia be detected or suspected.
Sick and debilitated dogs and cats should only be premedicated with dexmedetomidine before induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia based on a risk-benefit assessment.
In cases of overdosing the following recommendations should be followed:
DOGS:
In cases of overdosage, or if the effects of dexmedetomidine become potentially life- threatening, the appropriate dose of atipamezole is 10 times the initial dose of dexmedetomidine (micrograms/ kg bw or micrograms/ square meter body surface area).
The dose volume of atipamezole at the concentration of 5 mg/ ml equals the dose volume of Dexdomitor that was given to the dog, regardless of route of administration of Dexdomitor.
CATS:
In cases of overdosage, or if the effects of dexmedetomidine become potentially life- threatening, the appropriate antagonist is atipamezole, administered by intramuscular injection, at the following dose:
5 times the initial dose dexmedetomidine in micrograms/ kg bw.
After concurrent exposure to a triple (3X) overdose of dexmedetomidine and 15 mg ketamine/ kg, atipamezole can be administered at the recommended dose level for reversal of effects induced by dexmedetomidine.
At high serum concentration of dexmedetomidine sedation is not increased although the level of analgesia does increase with further dose increases.
In case of accidental oral intake or self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert to the physician but DO NOT DRIVE as sedation and changes in blood pressure may occur.
Avoid skin, eye or mucosal contact; the use of impermeable gloves is advisable.
In case of skin or mucosal contact, wash the exposed skin immediately after exposure with large amounts of water and remove contaminated clothes that are in direct contact with skin.
In case of eye contact, rinse abundantly with fresh water.
If symptoms occur, seek the advice of a physician.
If pregnant women handle the product, special caution should be observed not to self-inject as uterine contractions and decreased foetal blood pressure may occur after accidental systemic exposure.
Advice to doctors:
Dexdomitor is an α 2-adrenoreceptor agonist, symptoms after absorption may involve clinical effects including dose-dependent sedation, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, a dry mouth, and hyperglycaemia.
Ventricular arrhythmias have also been reported.
Respiratory and haemodynamic symptoms should be treated symptomatically.
The specific α 2 – adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole, which is approved for use in animals, has been used in humans only experimentally to antagonize dexmedetomidine-induced effects.
Persons with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients should administer the product with caution.
