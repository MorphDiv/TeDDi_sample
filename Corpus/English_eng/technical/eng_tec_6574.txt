You chose the'overwrite 'correction mode. Are you sure you want to lose your original image files?
Overwrite mode
Some of the images could not be analyzed with the current settings, or they do not contain any red-eye at all. Would you like to remove these images from the list?
Remove unprocessed images?
You tried to add RAW images to the plugin, but those file-types are not supported. They were automatically removed from the list.

Storage Settings
These settings control the storage of the corrected images. There are three modes to choose from: Subfolder: The corrected images will be saved in a subfolder under the current album path. Prefix: A custom prefix will be added to the corrected image. Suffix: A custom suffix will be added to the corrected image. Overwrite: All original images will be replaced. Each of the three modes allows you to add an optional keyword to the image metadata.

Unprocessed Image Handling
These settings control the handling of unprocessed images when running in test-mode. To speed up the final correction, unprocessed images can be removed from the list, so that they are not analyzed again. There are three modes to choose from: Ask the user: A popup window will appear to ask for further actions. Keep in file list: All unprocessed images will be kept in the list. Remove from file list: All unprocessed images are removed after the test run.
& Ask the user
If checked, the user will be asked to keep or remove unprocessed images.
& Keep in file list

Slower (low-res / slightly blurred images) In this mode the automatic detection and correction of red-eye is the most reliable. The drawback of the higher detection rate is a much slower computation.
Standard This mode is adequate for most image resolutions. Always try this mode first.
Faster (high-res images) In this mode the automatic detection will be faster, but more false positives may occur. Use this mode only for very high-resolution and sharp images.
