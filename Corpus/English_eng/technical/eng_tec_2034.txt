You can navigate from one result to the next, or you can highlight all matching cells at once, then apply another format or replace the cell content by other content.

Cells can contain text or numbers that were entered directly as in a text document.
But cells can also contain text or numbers as the result of a calculation.
For example, if a cell contains the formula =1+2 it displays the result 3.
You must decide whether to search for the 1 respective 2, or to search the 3.
