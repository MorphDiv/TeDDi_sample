To initialize an object, you use the new statement to instantiate the object to a variable.
?php class foo {function do_foo() {echo "Doing foo .";}} $bar = new foo; $bar - do_foo();?
For a full discussion, please read the section Classes and Objects.
If an object is converted to an object, it is not modified.
If a value of any other type is converted to an object, a new instace of the stdClass built in class is created.
If the value was null, the new instance will be empty.
For any other value, a member variable named scalar will contain the value.
?php $obj = (object) 'ciao'; echo $obj - gt;scalar; / / outputs'ciao '?
