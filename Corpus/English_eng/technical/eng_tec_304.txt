Integrating new UNO components
Programmers can write and integrate their own UNO (Universal Network Objects) components to $[officename].
Those new components can be added to the $[officename] menus and toolbars; we call them &quot; Add-Ons &quot; .
The integration of new components is supported by some tools and services.
Details can be found in the $[officename] Developer's Guide.
The three main steps are as follows:
unopkg
, which can be found in {installpath}
/
\
program.
Integrate the new components as services.
The ProtocolHandler and JobDispatch services assist you; more information can be found in the $[officename] Developer's Guide.
Change the user interface (menus or toolbars).
This can be done almost automatically by writing an XML text file that describes the changes.
More information can be found in the $[officename] Developer's Guide.
