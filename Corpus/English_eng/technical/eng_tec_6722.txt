Server requires authentication
Check this option if your SMTP server requires authentication before accepting mail. This is known as'Authenticated SMTP 'or simply ASMTP.
Store password
Check this option to have your password stored. If KWallet is available the password will be stored there which is considered safe. However, if KWallet is not available, the password will be stored in the configuration file. The password is stored in an obfuscated format, but should not be considered secure from decryption efforts if access to the configuration file is obtained.
