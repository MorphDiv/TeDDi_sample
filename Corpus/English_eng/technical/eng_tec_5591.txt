The uachanger adds a menu to & konqueror; that allows you to change the Browser and Operating System identification on a domain-by-domain basis. This is useful when browsing websites that limit access to those using a particular web browser.

The User Agent Changer
Using the User Agent Changer
The & konqueror; uachanger plugin can be accessed in the menubar under Tools Change Browser Identification
Default Identification
The default User Agent header for & konqueror; is Mozilla/ 5.0(compatible; Konqueror/ 3.2)(KHTML, like Gecko). If you come across a site that refuses this browser access, change your User Agent to one of the options below.
Internet Explorer
Allows you to change your User Agent header to MSIE for sites that refuse Mozilla -based browsers entry. You will most likely need to use one of the MSIE User Agents if you wish to use & konqueror; to access Hotmail.
Mozilla
Allows you to change the User Agent header in & konqueror; to appear as Mozilla version 1.2.1 through 1.6
Netscape Navigator
Pages that do n't comply with W3C recommendations, or were written using proprietary & HTML; elements and attributes will render correctly if you choose to send the User Agent of these old browsers.
Other
This section contains miscellaneous browsers that you can use to change your User Agent.
Apply To Entire Site
This option allows you to specify that the defined User Agent applies across every page on the site you are visiting.
Configure
Selecting Configure allows you to fine tune the amount of information you wish to reveal about the browser and operating system being used.
