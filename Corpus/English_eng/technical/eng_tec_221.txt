Trace Precedents
This function shows the relationship between the current cell containing a formula and the cells used in the formula.
Traces are displayed in the sheet with marking arrows.
At the same time, the range of all the cells contained in the formula of the current cell is highlighted with a blue frame.
This function is based on the principle of layers.
For example, if the precedent cell to a formula is already indicated with a tracer arrow, when you repeat this command, the tracer arrows are drawn to the precedent cells of this cell.
