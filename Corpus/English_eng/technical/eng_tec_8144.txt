4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Twinrix Paediatric is indicated for use in non immune infants, children and adolescents from 1 year up to and including 15 years who are at risk of both hepatitis A and hepatitis B infection.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Posology
- Dosage
The dose of 0.5 ml (360 ELISA Units HA/ 10 µg HBsAg) is recommended for infants, children and adolescents from 1 year up to and including 15 years of age.
- Primary vaccination schedule
The standard primary course of vaccination with Twinrix Paediatric consists of three doses, the first administered at the elected date, the second one month later and the third six months after the first dose.
The recommended schedule should be adhered to.
Once initiated, the primary course of vaccination should be completed with the same vaccine.
- Booster dose.
Long-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Twinrix Paediatric are available up to 48 months after vaccination.
The anti-HBs and anti-HAV antibody titres observed following a primary vaccination course with the combined vaccine are in the range of what is seen following vaccination with the monovalent vaccines.
The kinetics of antibody decline are also similar.
General guidelines
2 for booster vaccination can therefore be drawn from experience with the monovalent vaccines.
Hepatitis B
The need for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine in healthy individuals who have received a full primary vaccination course has not been established; however some official vaccination programmes currently include a recommendation for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and these should be respected.
For some categories of subjects or patients exposed to HBV (e. g. haemodialysis or immunocompromised patients) a precautionary attitude should be considered to ensure a protective antibody level ≥ 10IU/ l.
Hepatitis A
It is not yet fully established whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination will require booster doses as protection in the absence of detectable antibodies may be insured by immunological memory.
Guidelines for boosting are based on the assumption that antibodies are required for protection; anti-HAV antibodies have been predicted to persist for at least 10 years.
In situations where a booster dose of both hepatitis A and hepatitis B are desired, Twinrix Paediatric can be given.
Alternatively, subjects primed with Twinrix Paediatric may be administered a booster dose of either of the monovalent vaccines.
Method of administration
Twinrix Paediatric is for intramuscular injection, preferably in the deltoid region in adolescents and children or in the anterolateral thigh in infants.
Exceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders.
However, this route of administration may result in suboptimal immune response to the vaccine.
(see section 4.4)
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients or neomycin.
Hypersensitivity after previous administration of hepatitis A and/ or hepatitis B vaccines.
The administration of Twinrix Paediatric should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
It is possible that subjects may be in the incubation period of a HA or HB infection at the time of vaccination.
It is not known whether Twinrix Paediatric will prevent HA and HB in such cases.
The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis C and hepatitis E and other pathogens known to infect the liver.
Twinrix Paediatric is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis (e. g. needle stick injury).
The vaccine has not been tested in patients with impaired immunity.
In haemodialysis patients, patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with an impaired immune system, the anticipated immune response may not be achieved after the primary immunisation course.
Such patients may require additional doses of vaccine; nevertheless immunocompromised patients may fail
3 to demonstrate an adequate response.
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.
Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration into the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal response to the vaccine, these routes should be avoided.
However, exceptionally Twinrix Paediatric can be administered subcutaneously to subjects with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects.
(see section 4.2)
TWINRIX PAEDIATRIC SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE ADMINISTERED INTRAVASCULARLY.
As with any injection procedure, vasovagal syncope can infrequently occur following administration of Twinrix Paediatric to adolescents.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No data on concomitant administration of Twinrix Paediatric with specific hepatitis A immunoglobulin or hepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated.
However, when the monovalent hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines were administered concomitantly with specific immunoglobulins, no influence on seroconversion was observed although it may result in lower antibody titers.
As the concomitant administration of Twinrix Paediatric and other vaccines has not specifically been studied it is advised that the vaccine should not be administered at the same time as other vaccines.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
The effect of Twinrix Paediatrict on embryo-fetal, peri-natal and post-natal survival and development has been assessed in rats.
This study did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/ fetal development, parturition or post-natal development.
The effect of Twinrix Paediatric on embryo-fetal, peri-natal and post-natal survival and development has not been prospectively evaluated in clinical trials.
Data on outcomes of a limited number of pregnancies in vaccinated women do not indicate any adverse effects of Twinrix Paediatric on pregnancy or on the health of the fetus/ newborn child.
While it is not expected that recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen would have adverse effects on pregnancies or the fetus it is recommended that vaccination should be delayed until after delivery unless there is an urgent need to protect the mother against hepatitis B infection.
Lactation
It is unknown whether Twinrix Paediatric is excreted in human breast milk.
The excretion of Twinrix Paediatric in milk has not been studied in animals.
A decision on whether to continue/ discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/ discontinue therapy with Twinrix Paediatric should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Twinrix Paediatric therapy to the woman.
4.7 Effects on the ability to drive and use machines
Twinrix Paediatric has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects

5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmaco-therapeutic group:
Hepatitis vaccines, ATC code J07BC20.
Twinrix Paediatric is a combined vaccine formulated by pooling bulk preparations of the purified, inactivated hepatitis A (HA) virus and purified hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), separately adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate.
The HA virus is propagated in MRC5 human diploid cells.
HBsAg is produced by culture, in a selective medium, of genetically engineered yeast cells.
Twinrix Paediatric confers immunity against HAV and HBV infection by inducing specific anti-HA and anti-HBs antibodies.
Protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B develops within 2-4 weeks.
In the clinical studies, specific humoral antibodies against hepatitis A were observed in approximately 89% of the subjects one month after the first dose and in 100% one month after the third dose (i. e. month 7).
Specific
6 humoral antibodies against hepatitis B were observed in approximately 67% of the subjects after the first dose and 100% after the third dose.
In a long term clinical trial, persistence of anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies has been demonstrated up to 48 months following the initiation of a primary vaccination course of Twinrix Paediatric in the majority of vaccinees (see section 4.2).
The kinetics of decline of anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies were shown to be similar to those of the monovalent vaccines.
These data were generated with the former Twinrix formulation containing thiomersal and a preservative.
A clinical study conducted with the current formulation of Twinrix in adults showed that the current formulation elicited similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as compared to the former formulation.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on general safety studies (see section 4.6).

Further information
1.
WHAT TWINRIX PAEDIATRIC IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Twinrix Paediatric is a vaccine used in infants, children and adolescents from 1 year up to and including 15 years to prevent two diseases: hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases.
• Hepatitis A:
Hepatitis A is an infectious disease, which can affect the liver.
This disease is caused by the hepatitis A virus.
The hepatitis A virus can be passed from person to person in food and drink, or by swimming in water contaminated by sewage.
Symptoms of hepatitis A begin 3 to 6 weeks after coming into contact with the virus.
These consist of nausea (feeling sick), fever and aches and pains.
After a few days the whites of eyes and skin may become yellowish (jaundice).
The severity and type of symptoms can vary.
Young children may not develop jaundice.
Most people recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to keep people off work for about a month.
• Hepatitis B:
Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.
It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed).
The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of infected people.
Vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases.
None of the components in the vaccine are infectious.

Further information
1.
WHAT TWINRIX PAEDIATRIC IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Twinrix Paediatric is a vaccine used in infants, children and adolescents from 1 year up to and including 15 years to prevent two diseases: hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases.
• Hepatitis A:
Hepatitis A is an infectious disease, which can affect the liver.
This disease is caused by the hepatitis A virus.
The hepatitis A virus can be passed from person to person in food and drink, or by swimming in water contaminated by sewage.
Symptoms of hepatitis A begin 3 to 6 weeks after coming into contact with the virus.
These consist of nausea (feeling sick), fever and aches and pains.
After a few days the whites of eyes and skin may become yellowish (jaundice).
The severity and type of symptoms can vary.
Young children may not develop jaundice.
Most people recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to keep people off work for about a month.
• Hepatitis B:
Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus.
It causes the liver to become swollen (inflamed).
The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of infected people.
Vaccination is the best way to protect against these diseases.
None of the components in the vaccine are infectious.
