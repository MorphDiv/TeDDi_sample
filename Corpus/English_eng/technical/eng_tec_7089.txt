Gnometris is GNOME's version of Tetris, the classic game of interlocking four-piece blocks. As they fall from the top, the player must orient them to fit the other blocks at the bottom so that they form a complete horizontal line, in which case that line disappears and the player gains points.

Scoring Points
You score points through two methods: dropping blocks faster and deleting complete lines of blocks. When you delete lines, you get more points, but dropping blocks faster will quickly add up. As you level up, the blocks will begin falling faster. The highest level is 10, at which point you will only have just over a second to manipulate each block.
Viewing Past Scores
You can view the top ten scores played on your computer through
Customizing
Customizing Game Start-up
By going to
Number of Pre-filled Rows
You can change the number of rows that already have blocks at the start-up of each new game by using the spin box. You can start with up to 19 rows pre-filled at the start-up of your game. The default number of pre-filled rows is zero.
Density of Pre-filled Rows
You can change the density of the blocks in the pre-filled rows at the start-up of each game. You can choose a density up to 10 blocks. You should first choose how many rows you want pre-filled under
Level to Start On
You can adjust the level of difficulty you start on. The highest level you can start on is 10, which is the highest level you can play to. The default starting level is one.
Customizing the Gameplay
From
Enable sounds
Turn the sound effects on and off using this option. If you are playing this game in any area which you share with other people, you should probably select off.
Preview Next Block
Choose this option if you want to see the next block that is going to fall. This feature helps you plan the placement of your blocks.
Use Random Block Colors
Choose if you want the various block configurations to be color coded or randomly colored. If you use the colors to help you identify blocks, random colors will make the game more difficult.
Bastard Mode
Choose this option if you want to select mode that is designed specifically to annoy the player. With this feature enabled, you never get the piece you want, and very seldom complete a row. Next block preview doesn't correspond to actual piece you get next, but to the one you probably wish to get.
Rotate Blocks Counterclockwise
Choose this option if you want the blocks to rotate counterclockwise or not.
Show where the block will land
If this feature is used a grey image of the block will show you where the block will land. This feature is very useful for beginning players, but experienced players will find it a distraction.
Customizing the Look of
Under
Block Image
You can change the style of the blocks, including image and size. There are a variety of pre-made styles.
