(PHP 3 = 3.0.5, PHP 4)
This function returns structured information about one or more expressions that includes its type and value.
Arrays are explored recursively with values indented to show structure.
Tip:
As with anything that outputs its result directly to the browser, you can use the output-control functions to capture the output of this function, and save it in a string (for example).
Compare var_dump() to print_r().
Example 1. var_dump() example
pre ?php $a = array (1, 2, array ("a", "b", "c")); var_dump ($a); / * output: array(3) {[0]= int(1) [1]= int(2) [2]= array(3) {[0]= string(1) "a "[1]= string(1) "b" [2]= string(1) "c "}} * / $b = 3.1; $c = TRUE; var_dump($b,$c); / * output: float(3.1) bool(true) * /? / pre
