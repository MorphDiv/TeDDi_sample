EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
GLUBRAVA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Glubrava?
Glubrava is a medicine that is available as white, oblong tablets containing two active substances, pioglitazone (15 mg) and metformin hydrochloride (850 mg).
This medicine is the same as Competact, which is already authorised in the European Union (EU).
The company that makes Competact has agreed that its scientific data can be used for Glubrava.
What is Glubrava used for?
Glubrava is used in patients (particularly those who are overweight) who have non insulin-dependent diabetes (type 2 diabetes).
Glubrava is used in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin (an anti-diabetes medicine) used on its own and at the maximum possible dose.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Glubrava used?
The usual dose of Glubrava is one tablet taken twice a day.
Patients changing from metformin only to Glubrava may need to introduce pioglitazone slowly until a dose of 30 mg per day is reached.
It is possible to change to Glubrava directly from metformin if appropriate.
Taking Glubrava with or just after food may reduce any stomach problems caused by metformin.
Elderly patients should have their kidney function monitored regularly.
How does Glubrava work?
Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in the blood.
Glubrava contains two active substances, which each have a different mode of action.
Pioglitazone makes cells (fat, muscle and liver) more sensitive to insulin, which means that the body makes better use of the insulin it produces.
Metformin works mainly by inhibiting glucose production and reducing its absorption in the gut.
As a result of the action of both active substances, the blood glucose is reduced and this helps to control type 2 diabetes.
How has Glubrava been studied?
Pioglitazone on its own has been approved by the EU under the name Actos, and can be used with metformin in type 2 diabetes patients who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin alone.
Three studies of Actos used with metformin as separate tablets were used to support the use of Glubrava in the same indication.
The studies lasted from four months to two years and involved 1,305 patients who 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London, E14 4HB, UK Tel.

They measured the level in the blood of a substance (HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled.
What benefit has Glubrava shown during the studies?
In all studies, adding pioglitazone 30 mg to metformin gave an improvement in the control of blood glucose, with levels of HbA1c which were further decreased by 0.64 to 0.89% compared to the levels on metformin alone.
What is the risk associated with Glubrava?
The most common side effects of Glubrava (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are anaemia (low red blood cells), visual disturbance, weight increase, arthralgia (joint pain), headache, haematuria (blood in the urine) and erectile dysfunction (problems getting an erection).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Glubrava, see the Package Leaflet.
Glubrava should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone, metformin or any of the other ingredients, and in patients who have heart failure, or problems with their liver or their kidneys.
Glubrava should not be used in patients who have a disease that causes lack of oxygen to the tissues such as a recent heart attack or shock.
Glubrava should not be used where there is alcohol intoxication, diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketones), conditions that may affect the kidneys, and during breast-feeding.
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
Why has Glubrava been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the effectiveness of pioglitazone and metformin in type 2 diabetes had been shown, and that Glubrava simplifies treatment and improves compliance when a combination of the active substances is required.
They decided that Glubrava’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
They recommended that Glubrava be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Glubrava:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Glubrava to Takeda Global Research and Development Centre (Europe) Ltd on 11 December 2007.
