CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Gardasil is a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (see section 5.1).
The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Gardasil in adult females 16 to 26 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Gardasil in 9- to 15-year old children and adolescents.
Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males (see section 5.1).
The use of Gardasil should be in accordance with official recommendations.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The primary vaccination series consists of 3 separate 0.5 ml doses administered according to the following schedule:
0, 2, 6 months.
If an alternate vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose should be administered at least 3 months after the second dose.
All three doses should be given within a 1-year period.
The need for a booster dose has not been established.
2 Paediatric population:
Gardasil is not recommended for use in children below 9 years of age due to insufficient data on immunogenicity, safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).
The vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection.
The preferred site is the deltoid area of the upper arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.
Gardasil must not be injected intravascularly.
Neither subcutaneous nor intradermal administration has been studied.
These methods of administration are not recommended (see section 6.6).
It is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Gardasil complete the 3-dose vaccination course with Gardasil (see section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.
Individuals who develop symptoms indicative of hypersensitivity after receiving a dose of Gardasil should not receive further doses of Gardasil.
Administration of Gardasil should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile illness.
However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a mild upper respiratory tract infection or low-grade fever, is not a contraindication for immunisation.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.
Syncope (fainting) may follow any vaccination, especially in adolescents and young adults.
Syncope, sometimes associated with falling, has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil (See section 4.8).
Therefore, vaccinees should be carefully observed for approximately 15 minutes after administration of Gardasil.
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Gardasil may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.
Gardasil will only protect against diseases that are caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and to a limited extent against diseases caused by certain related HPV types (See section 5.1).
Therefore, appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used.
Gardasil has not been shown to have a therapeutic effect.
The vaccine is therefore not indicated for treatment of cervical cancer, high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal dysplastic lesions or genital warts.
It is also not intended to prevent progression of other established HPV-related lesions.
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening.
Since no vaccine is 100% effective and Gardasil will not provide protection against every HPV type, or against existing HPV infections, routine cervical screening remains critically important and should follow local recommendations.
There are no data on the use of Gardasil in subjects with impaired immune responsiveness.
Individuals with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of potent immunosuppressive therapy, a genetic defect, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, or other causes, may not respond to the vaccine.
This vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.
The duration of protection is currently unknown.
Sustained protective efficacy has been observed for 3 4.5 years after completion of the 3-dose series.
Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing (see section 5.1).
There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Gardasil with other HPV vaccines.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In all clinical trials, individuals who had received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products during the 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose were excluded.
Use with other vaccines
Administration of Gardasil at the same time (but, for injected vaccines, at a different injection site) as hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine did not interfere with the immune response to the HPV types.
The seroprotection rates (proportion of subjects reaching seroprotective level anti-HBs > 10 mIU/ ml) were unaffected (96.5% for concomitant vaccination and 97.5% for hepatitis B vaccine only).
Anti-HBs geometric mean antibody titres were lower on co-administration, but the clinical significance of this observation is not known.
The concomitant administration of Gardasil with vaccines other than hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine has not been studied.
Use with hormonal contraceptives
In clinical studies, 57.5% of women (age 16 to 26 years) who received Gardasil used hormonal contraceptives.
Use of hormonal contraceptives did not appear to affect the immune response to Gardasil.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Specific studies of the vaccine in pregnant women were not conducted.
During the clinical development program, 3,315 women (vaccine = 1,657 vs. placebo = 1,658) reported at least one pregnancy.
There were no significant differences in types of anomalies or proportion of pregnancies with an adverse outcome in Gardasil and placebo treated subjects.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
The data on Gardasil administered during pregnancy did not indicate any safety signal.
However, these data are insufficient to recommend use of Gardasil during pregnancy.
Vaccination should, therefore, be postponed until completion of pregnancy.
In breastfeeding mothers given Gardasil or placebo during the vaccination period of the clinical trials the rates of adverse reactions in the mother and the breastfed infant were comparable between the vaccination and the placebo groups.
In addition, vaccine immunogenicity was comparable among breastfeeding mothers and women who did not breastfeed during the vaccine administration.
Therefore Gardasil can be given to breastfeeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
4 In 5 clinical trials (4 placebo-controlled), subjects were administered Gardasil or placebo on the day of enrolment and approximately 2 and 6 months thereafter.
Few subjects (0.2%) discontinued due to adverse reactions.
Safety was evaluated in either the entire study population (4 studies) or in a predefined subset (one study) of the study population using vaccination report card (VRC)-aided surveillance for 14 days after each injection of Gardasil or placebo.
The subjects who were monitored using VRC-aided surveillance included 6,160 subjects (5,088 females 9 to 26 years of age and 1,072 males 9 to 15 years of age at enrolment) who received Gardasil and 4,064 subjects who received placebo.
The following vaccine-related adverse reactions were observed among recipients of Gardasil at a frequency of at least 1.0% and also at a greater frequency than observed among placebo recipients.
They are ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:
[Very Common (≥ 1/ 10); Common (≥ 1/ 100,  1/ 10); Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000,  1/ 100); Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000,  1/ 1,000); Very Rare ( 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports]
General disorders and administration site conditions:
Very common: pyrexia.
Very common: at the injection site: erythema, pain, swelling.
Common: at the injection site: bruising, pruritus.
In addition, in clinical trials adverse reactions that were judged to be vaccine- or placebo-related by the study investigator were observed at frequencies lower than 1%:
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:
Very rare: bronchospasm.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder:
Rare: urticaria.
Seven cases (0.06%) of urticaria were reported in the Gardasil group and 17 cases (0.18%) were seen in the adjuvant-containing placebo group.
In the clinical studies, subjects in the Safety Population reported any new medical conditions during the follow-up of up to 4 years.
Among 11,778 subjects who received Gardasil and 9,686 subjects who received placebo, there were 28 cases of non-specific arthritis/ arthropathy reported, 20 in the Gardasil group and 8 in the placebo group.
Post Marketing Experience
Post Marketing adverse events have been spontaneously reported for Gardasil and are not listed above.
Because these events were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish, for all events, a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.
Blood and lymphatic system disorders: lymphadenopathy.
Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions.
Nervous system disorders:
Guillain-Barré syndrome, dizziness, headache, syncope sometimes accompanied by tonic-clonic movements.
Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea, vomiting.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia.
5 General disorders and administration site conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise.
4.9 Overdose
There have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of Gardasil.
In general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to recommended single doses of Gardasil.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Viral Vaccine, ATC code:
J07BM01
Mechanism of Action
Gardasil is an adjuvanted non-infectious recombinant quadrivalent vaccine prepared from the highly purified virus-like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid L1 protein of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.
The VLPs contain no viral DNA, they cannot infect cells, reproduce or cause disease.
HPV only infects humans, but animal studies with analogous papillomaviruses suggest that the efficacy of LI VLP vaccines is mediated by the development of a humoral immune response.
HPV 16 and HPV 18 are estimated to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers; 80% of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS); 45-70% of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/ 3); 25% of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1); approximately 70% of HPV related high- grade vulvar (VIN 2/ 3) and vaginal (VaIN 2/ 3) intraepithelial neoplasia.
HPV 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of genital warts and 10% of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1).
CIN 3 and AIS have been accepted as immediate precursors of invasive cervical cancer.
The term "premalignant genital lesions" in section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/ 3), high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/ 3) and high- grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/ 3).
Clinical Studies
The efficacy of Gardasil was assessed in 4 placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase II and III clinical studies including a total of 20,541 16- to 26-year old women, who were enrolled and vaccinated without pre-screening for the presence of HPV infection.
The primary efficacy endpoints included HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related vulvar and vaginal lesions (genital warts, VIN, VaIN) and CIN of any grade (Protocol 013, FUTURE I), HPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/ 3 and AIS (Protocol 015, FUTURE II), HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection (Protocol 007), and HPV 16-related persistent infection (Protocol 005).
Efficacy results are presented for the combined analysis of study protocols.
The efficacy for HPV 16/ 18 related CIN 2/ 3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), 007, 013, and 015.
The efficacy for all other endpoints is based on protocols 007, 013, and 015.
The median duration of follow-up for these studies was 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, and 3.0 years for Protocol 005, Protocol 007, Protocol 013, and Protocol 015, respectively.
The median duration of follow-up for the combined protocols (005, 007, 013, and 015) was 3.6 years.
Results of individual studies support the results from the combined analysis.
Gardasil was efficacious against HPV disease caused by each of the four vaccine HPV type.
At end of study, subjects enrolled in the two Phase-III studies (Protocol-013 and Protocol-015), were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.7 years).
6 Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) Grade 2/ 3 (moderate to high-grade dysplasia) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) were used in the clinical trials as a surrogate marker for cervical cancer.
Prophylactic Efficacy against Vaccine HPV Types (HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18)
The primary analyses of efficacy, with respect to vaccine HPV types (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18), were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population (n= all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment, no major protocol deviations and naïve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7)).
Efficacy was measured starting after the Month 7 visit.
Overall, 73% of subjects were naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to all 4 HPV types at enrolment.
Efficacy in subjects naïve to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s)
The efficacy results for relevant endpoints analysed at 2 years post-enrolment and at end of study (median duration of follow-up = 3.6 years) in the per-protocol population are presented in the Table 1.
In a supplemental analysis, the efficacy of Gardasil was evaluated against HPV 16/ 18-related CIN 3 and AIS.

*Number of subjects with at least one follow-up visit after Month 7 **Based on virologic evidence, this CIN 3 case in a patient chronically infected with HPV 52 is likely to be causally related to HPV 52.
In only 1 of 11 specimens HPV 16 was found (at Month 32.5) and was not detected in tissue excised during LEEP (Loop Electro-Excision Procedure).
In the second CIN 3 case observed in a patient infected with HPV 51 at Day 1 (in 2 of 9 specimens); HPV 16 was detected at a Month 51 biopsy (in 1 of 9 specimens) and HPV 56 was detected in 3 of 9 specimens at Month 52 in tissue excised during LEEP. ***Patients were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.6 years) Note:
Point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up.
At end of study and in the combined protocols,
the efficacy of Gardasil against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related CIN 1 was 95.9% (95% CI:
91.4, 98.4) the efficacy of Gardasil against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related CIN (1, 2, 3) or AIS was 96.0% (95% CI:
92.3, 98.2)
the efficacy of Gardasil against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VIN2/ 3 and VaIN 2/ 3 was 100% (95% CI:
67.2, 100) and 100% (95% CI:
55.4, 100) respectively
7 the efficacy of Gardasil against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related genital warts was 99.0% (95% CI:
96.2,99.9).
In Protocol 012 the efficacy of Gardasil against the 6 month definition of persistent infection [samples positive on two or more consecutive visits 6 months apart (±1 month) or longer] related to HPV 16 was 98.7% (95% CI:
95.1, 99.8) and 100.0% (95% CI:
93.2, 100.0) for HPV 18 respectively, after a follow-up of up to 4 years (mean of 3.6 years).
For the 12 month definition of persistent infection, efficacy against HPV 16 was 100.0% (95% CI:
93.9, 100.0) and 100.0% (95% CI:
79.9, 100.0) for HPV 18 respectively.
Efficacy in individuals with evidence of HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 infection or disease at day 1
There was no evidence of protection from disease caused by vaccine HPV types for which subjects were PCR positive at day 1.
Individuals who were already infected with one or more vaccine-related HPV types prior to vaccination were protected from clinical disease caused by the remaining vaccine HPV types.
Efficacy in subjects with and without prior infection or disease due to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18
The modified intention to treat (ITT) population included women regardless of baseline HPV status at Day 1, who received at least one vaccination and in whom case counting started at 1 month Postdose 1.
This population approximates to the general population of women with respect to prevalence of HPV infection or disease at enrolment.
The results are summarised in Table 2.

*Number of subjects with at least one follow-up visit after 30 days after Day 1 **Percent efficacy is calculated from the combined protocols.
The efficacy for HPV 16/ 18 related CIN 2/ 3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), 007, 013, and 015.
Patients were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.6 years).
Note: point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up.
Efficacy against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VIN 2/ 3 was 73.3% (95% CI:
40.3, 89.4), against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VaIN 2/ 3 was 85.7% (95% CI:
37.6, 98.4), and against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18- related genital warts was 80.3% (95% CI:
73.9, 85.3) in the combined protocols at end of study.
Overall 12% of the combined study population had an abnormal Pap test suggestive of CIN at Day 1.
Among subjects with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 who were naïve to the relevant vaccine HPV types at Day 1, efficacy of the vaccine remained high.
Among subjects with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 who were already infected with the relevant vaccine HPV types at Day 1, no vaccine efficacy was observed.
8 Protection Against the Overall Burden of Cervical HPV disease in 16- Through 26-Year-Old Women
The impact of Gardasil against the overall risk for cervical, HPV disease (i. e., disease caused by any HPV type) was evaluated starting 30 days after the first dose in 17,599 subjects enrolled in the two phase III efficacy trials (Protocols 013 and 015).
Among subjects who were naïve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pap test at Day 1, administration of Gardasil reduced the incidence of CIN 2/ 3 or AIS caused by vaccine- or non-vaccine HPV types by 42.7% (95% CI:
23.7, 57.3) and of genital warts by 82.8% (95% CI:
74.3, 88.8)at end of study.
In the modified ITT population, the benefit of the vaccine with respect to the overall incidence of CIN 2/ 3 or AIS (caused by any HPV type) and of genital warts was much lower, with a reduction of 18.4% (95% CI:
7.0, 28.4) and 62.5% (95% CI:
54.0, 69.5), respectively, as Gardasil does not impact the course of infections or disease that are present at vaccination onset.
Impact on Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures
The impact of Gardasil on rates of Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures regardless of causal HPV types was evaluated in 18,150 subjects enrolled in Protocol 007, Protocols 013 and 015.
In the HPV naïve population (naïve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pap test at Day 1), Gardasil reduced the proportion of women who experienced, a definitive cervical therapy procedure (Loop Electro-Excision Procedure or Cold-Knife Conization) by 41.9% (95% CI:
27.7, 53.5) at end of study.
In the ITT population the corresponding reduction was 23.9% (95% CI:
15.2, 31.7).
Cross-protective efficacy The efficacy of Gardasil against CIN (any grade) and CIN 2/ 3 or AIS caused by 10 non-vaccine HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) structurally related to HPV 16 or HPV 18 was evaluated in the combined Phase III efficacy database (N = 17,599) after a median follow-up of 3.7 years (at end of study).
Efficacy against disease endpoints caused by pre-specified combinations of non-vaccine HPV types was measured.
The studies were not powered to assess efficacy against disease caused by individual HPV types.
The primary analysis was done in type-specific populations that required women to be negative for the type being analyzed, but who could be positive for other HPV types (96% of the overall population).
The primary time point analysis after 3 years did not reach statistical significance for all pre-specified endpoints.
The final end-of-study results for the combined incidence of CIN 2/ 3 or AIS in this population after a median follow-up of 3.7 years are shown in Table 3.
For composite endpoints, statistically significant efficacy against disease was demonstrated against HPV types phylogenetically related to HPV 16 (primarily HPV 31) whereas no statistically significant efficacy was observed for HPV types phylogenetically related to HPV 18 (including HPV 45).
For the 10 individual HPV types, statistical significance was only reached for HPV 31.

Immunogenicity
Assays to Measure Immune Response
No minimum antibody level associated with protection has been identified for HPV vaccines.
The immunogenicity of Gardasil was assessed in 8,915 (Gardasil n = 4,666; placebo n = 4,249) women 18 to 26 years of age and 3,400 female (Gardasil n = 1,471; placebo n = 583) and male (Gardasil n = 1,071; placebo n = 275) adolescents 9 to 17 years of age.
Type-specific immunoassays, competitive Luminex-based immunoassay (cLIA), with type-specific standards were used to assess immunogenicity to each vaccine type.
This assay measures antibodies against a single neutralizing epitope for each individual HPV type.
Immune Responses to Gardasil
In the clinical studies, 99.9%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.6% of individuals who received Gardasil became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18-seropositive respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3 across all age groups tested.
Gardasil induced high anti-HPV Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) 1 month Postdose 3 in all age groups tested.
Anti-HPV levels in placebo subjects who had cleared an HPV infection (seropositive and PCR negative) were substantially lower than those induced by the vaccine.
Furthermore, anti-HPV levels (GMTs) in vaccinated subjects remained at or above serostatus cut-off during the long-term follow-up of the phase III studies (see below under Persistence).
10 Bridging the Efficacy of Gardasil from Young Adult Women to Young Adolescents
A clinical study (Protocol 016) compared the immunogenicity of Gardasil in 10- to 15-year-old boys and girls to those in 16- to 23-year old adolescent and young women.
In the vaccine group, 99.1 to 100% became seropositive to all vaccine serotypes by 1 month Postdose 3.
Table 4 compares the 1 month Postdose 3 anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs in 9- to 15-year-old boys and girls with those in 16- to 26-year old young women.

GMT- Geometric mean titre in mMU/ ml (mMU = milli-Merck units)
Anti-HPV responses at Month 7 among 9- to 15-year-old girls and boys were non-inferior to anti-HPV responses in 16- to 26-year-old young women for whom efficacy was established in the phase III studies.
Immunogenicity was related to age and Month 7 anti-HPV levels were significantly higher in younger individuals below 12 years of age than in those above that age.
On the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the efficacy of Gardasil in 9- to 15-year-old girls is inferred.
Immunogenicity and safety of Gardasil have been demonstrated in 9- to 15-year-old boys.
Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males.
Persistence
In Protocol 007 peak anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 GMTs were observed at Month 7.
The GMTs declined through Month 24 and then stabilized until at least Month 60.
The exact duration of immunity following a 3-dose series has not been established.
In phase III studies, at end of study 90%, 95%, 98% and 60% of subjects who received Gardasil in the per-protocol immunogenicity population were anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti HPV 18 seropositive, respectively.
Subjects who were seronegative for anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 in the cLIA at end of study were still protected against clinical disease.
Evidence of Anamnestic (Immune Memory) Response
Evidence of an anamnestic response was seen in vaccinated individuals who were seropositive to relevant HPV type(s) prior to vaccination.
In addition, a subset of vaccinated individuals who received a challenge dose of Gardasil 5 years after the onset of vaccination, exhibited a rapid and strong anamnestic response that exceeded the anti-HPV GMTs observed 1 month Postdose 3.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic studies is not required for vaccines.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
11 Single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity and local tolerance studies revealed no special hazards to humans.
Gardasil induced specific antibody responses against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in pregnant rats, following one or multiple intramuscular injections.
Antibodies against all four HPV types were transferred to the offspring during gestation and possibly during lactation.
There were no treatment- related effects on developmental signs, behaviour, reproductive performance, or fertility of the offspring.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Gardasil is a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (see section 5.1).
The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Gardasil in adult females 16 to 26 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Gardasil in 9- to 15-year old children and adolescents.
Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males (see section 5.1).
The use of Gardasil should be in accordance with official recommendations.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The primary vaccination series consists of 3 separate 0.5 ml doses administered according to the following schedule:
0, 2, 6 months.
If an alternate vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose should be administered at least one month after the first dose and the third dose should be administered at least 3 months after the second dose.
All three doses should be given within a 1-year period.
The need for a booster dose has not been established.
14 Paediatric population:
Gardasil is not recommended for use in children below 9 years of age due to insufficient data on immunogenicity, safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).
The vaccine should be administered by intramuscular injection.
The preferred site is the deltoid area of the upper arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.
Gardasil must not be injected intravascularly.
Neither subcutaneous nor intradermal administration has been studied.
These methods of administration are not recommended (see section 6.6).
It is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Gardasil complete the 3-dose vaccination course with Gardasil (see section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.
Individuals who develop symptoms indicative of hypersensitivity after receiving a dose of Gardasil should not receive further doses of Gardasil.
Administration of Gardasil should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile illness.
However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a mild upper respiratory tract infection or low-grade fever, is not a contraindication for immunisation.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of rare anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.
Syncope (fainting) may follow any vaccination, especially in adolescents and young adults.
Syncope, sometimes associated with falling, has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil (See section 4.8).
Therefore, vaccinees should be carefully observed for approximately 15 minutes after administration of Gardasil.
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Gardasil may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.
Gardasil will only protect against diseases that are caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and to a limited extent against diseases caused by certain related HPV types (See section 5.1).
Therefore, appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used.
Gardasil has not been shown to have a therapeutic effect.
The vaccine is therefore not indicated for treatment of cervical cancer, high-grade cervical, vulvar and vaginal dysplastic lesions or genital warts.
It is also not intended to prevent progression of other established HPV-related lesions.
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening.
Since no vaccine is 100% effective and Gardasil will not provide protection against every HPV type, or against existing HPV infections, routine cervical screening remains critically important and should follow local recommendations.
There are no data on the use of Gardasil in subjects with impaired immune responsiveness.
Individuals with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due to the use of potent immunosuppressive therapy, a genetic defect, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, or other causes, may not respond to the vaccine.
This vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopaenia or any coagulation disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.
The duration of protection is currently unknown.
Sustained protective efficacy has been observed for 15 4.5 years after completion of the 3-dose series.
Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing (see section 5.1).
There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Gardasil with other HPV vaccines.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In all clinical trials, individuals who had received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products during the 6 months prior to the first vaccine dose were excluded.
Use with other vaccines
Administration of Gardasil at the same time (but, for injected vaccines, at a different injection site) as hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine did not interfere with the immune response to the HPV types.
The seroprotection rates (proportion of subjects reaching seroprotective level anti-HBs > 10 mIU/ ml) were unaffected (96.5% for concomitant vaccination and 97.5% for hepatitis B vaccine only).
Anti-HBs geometric mean antibody titres were lower on co-administration, but the clinical significance of this observation is not known.
The concomitant administration of Gardasil with vaccines other than hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine has not been studied.
Use with hormonal contraceptives
In clinical studies, 57.5% of women (age 16 to 26 years) who received Gardasil used hormonal contraceptives.
Use of hormonal contraceptives did not appear to affect the immune response to Gardasil.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Specific studies of the vaccine in pregnant women were not conducted.
During the clinical development program, 3,315 women (vaccine = 1,657 vs. placebo = 1,658) reported at least one pregnancy.
There were no significant differences in types of anomalies or proportion of pregnancies with an adverse outcome in Gardasil and placebo treated subjects.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
The data on Gardasil administered during pregnancy did not indicate any safety signal.
However, these data are insufficient to recommend use of Gardasil during pregnancy.
Vaccination should, therefore, be postponed until completion of pregnancy.
In breastfeeding mothers given Gardasil or placebo during the vaccination period of the clinical trials the rates of adverse reactions in the mother and the breastfed infant were comparable between the vaccination and the placebo groups.
In addition, vaccine immunogenicity was comparable among breastfeeding mothers and women who did not breastfeed during the vaccine administration.
Therefore Gardasil can be given to breastfeeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
16 In 5 clinical trials (4 placebo-controlled), subjects were administered Gardasil or placebo on the day of enrolment and approximately 2 and 6 months thereafter.
Few subjects (0.2%) discontinued due to adverse reactions.
Safety was evaluated in either the entire study population (4 studies) or in a predefined subset (one study) of the study population using vaccination report card (VRC)-aided surveillance for 14 days after each injection of Gardasil or placebo.
The subjects who were monitored using VRC-aided surveillance included 6,160 subjects (5,088 females 9 to 26 years of age and 1,072 males 9 to 15 years of age at enrolment) who received Gardasil and 4,064 subjects who received placebo.
The following vaccine-related adverse reactions were observed among recipients of Gardasil at a frequency of at least 1.0% and also at a greater frequency than observed among placebo recipients.
They are ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention:
[Very Common (≥ 1/ 10); Common (≥ 1/ 100,  1/ 10); Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000,  1/ 100); Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000,  1/ 1,000); Very Rare ( 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports]
General disorders and administration site conditions:
Very common: pyrexia.
Very common: at the injection site: erythema, pain, swelling.
Common: at the injection site: bruising, pruritus.
In addition, in clinical trials adverse reactions that were judged to be vaccine- or placebo-related by the study investigator were observed at frequencies lower than 1%:
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:
Very rare: bronchospasm.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder:
Rare: urticaria.
Seven cases (0.06%) of urticaria were reported in the Gardasil group and 17 cases (0.18%) were seen in the adjuvant-containing placebo group.
In the clinical studies, subjects in the Safety Population reported any new medical conditions during the follow-up of up to 4 years.
Among 11,778 subjects who received Gardasil and 9,686 subjects who received placebo, there were 28 cases of non-specific arthritis/ arthropathy reported, 20 in the Gardasil group and 8 in the placebo group.
Post Marketing Experience
Post Marketing adverse events have been spontaneously reported for Gardasil and are not listed above.
Because these events were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish, for all events, a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.
Blood and lymphatic system disorders: lymphadenopathy.
Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions.
Nervous system disorders:
Guillain-Barré syndrome, dizziness, headache, syncope sometimes accompanied by tonic-clonic movements.
Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea, vomiting.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia.
17 General disorders and administration site conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise.
4.9 Overdose
There have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of Gardasil.
In general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to recommended single doses of Gardasil.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Viral Vaccine, ATC code:
J07BM01
Mechanism of Action
Gardasil is an adjuvanted non-infectious recombinant quadrivalent vaccine prepared from the highly purified virus-like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid L1 protein of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.
The VLPs contain no viral DNA, they cannot infect cells, reproduce or cause disease.
HPV only infects humans, but animal studies with analogous papillomaviruses suggest that the efficacy of LI VLP vaccines is mediated by the development of a humoral immune response.
HPV 16 and HPV 18 are estimated to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers; 80% of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS); 45-70% of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/ 3); 25% of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1); approximately 70% of HPV related high- grade vulvar (VIN 2/ 3) and vaginal (VaIN 2/ 3) intraepithelial neoplasia.
HPV 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of genital warts and 10% of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1).
CIN 3 and AIS have been accepted as immediate precursors of invasive cervical cancer.
The term "premalignant genital lesions" in section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/ 3), high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 2/ 3) and high- grade vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN 2/ 3).
Clinical Studies
The efficacy of Gardasil was assessed in 4 placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase II and III clinical studies including a total of 20,541 16- to 26-year old women, who were enrolled and vaccinated without pre-screening for the presence of HPV infection.
The primary efficacy endpoints included HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related vulvar and vaginal lesions (genital warts, VIN, VaIN) and CIN of any grade (Protocol 013, FUTURE I), HPV 16- or 18-related CIN 2/ 3 and AIS (Protocol 015, FUTURE II), HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related persistent infection (Protocol 007), and HPV 16-related persistent infection (Protocol 005).
Efficacy results are presented for the combined analysis of study protocols.
The efficacy for HPV 16/ 18 related CIN 2/ 3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), 007, 013, and 015.
The efficacy for all other endpoints is based on protocols 007, 013, and 015.
The median duration of follow-up for these studies was 4.0, 3.0, 3.0, and 3.0 years for Protocol 005, Protocol 007, Protocol 013, and Protocol 015, respectively.
The median duration of follow-up for the combined protocols (005, 007, 013, and 015) was 3.6 years.
Results of individual studies support the results from the combined analysis.
Gardasil was efficacious against HPV disease caused by each of the four vaccine HPV type.
At end of study, subjects enrolled in the two Phase-III studies (Protocol-013 and Protocol-015), were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.7 years).
18 Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) Grade 2/ 3 (moderate to high-grade dysplasia) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) were used in the clinical trials as a surrogate marker for cervical cancer.
Prophylactic Efficacy against Vaccine HPV Types (HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18)
The primary analyses of efficacy, with respect to vaccine HPV types (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18), were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population (n= all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment, no major protocol deviations and naïve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7)).
Efficacy was measured starting after the Month 7 visit.
Overall, 73% of subjects were naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to all 4 HPV types at enrolment.
Efficacy in subjects naïve to the relevant vaccine HPV type(s)
The efficacy results for relevant endpoints analysed at 2 years post-enrolment and at end of study (median duration of follow-up = 3.6 years) in the per-protocol population are presented in the Table 1.
In a supplemental analysis, the efficacy of Gardasil was evaluated against HPV 16/ 18-related CIN 3 and AIS.

*Number of subjects with at least one follow-up visit after Month 7 **Based on virologic evidence, this CIN 3 case in a patient chronically infected with HPV 52 is likely to be causally related to HPV 52.
In only 1 of 11 specimens HPV 16 was found (at Month 32.5) and was not detected in tissue excised during LEEP (Loop Electro-Excision Procedure).
In the second CIN 3 case observed in a patient infected with HPV 51 at Day 1 (in 2 of 9 specimens); HPV 16 was detected at a Month 51 biopsy (in 1 of 9 specimens) and HPV 56 was detected in 3 of 9 specimens at Month 52 in tissue excised during LEEP. ***Patients were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.6 years) Note:
Point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up.
At end of study and in the combined protocols,
the efficacy of Gardasil against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related CIN 1 was 95.9% (95% CI:
91.4, 98.4) the efficacy of Gardasil against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related CIN (1, 2, 3) or AIS was 96.0% (95% CI:

55.4, 100) respectively
19 the efficacy of Gardasil against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related genital warts was 99.0% (95% CI:
96.2,99.9).
In Protocol 012 the efficacy of Gardasil against the 6 month definition of persistent infection [samples positive on two or more consecutive visits 6 months apart (±1 month) or longer] related to HPV 16 was 98.7% (95% CI:
95.1, 99.8) and 100.0% (95% CI:
93.2, 100.0) for HPV 18 respectively, after a follow-up of up to 4 years (mean of 3.6 years).
For the 12 month definition of persistent infection, efficacy against HPV 16 was 100.0% (95% CI:
93.9, 100.0) and 100.0% (95% CI:
79.9, 100.0) for HPV 18 respectively.
Efficacy in individuals with evidence of HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 infection or disease at day 1
There was no evidence of protection from disease caused by vaccine HPV types for which subjects were PCR positive at day 1.
Individuals who were already infected with one or more vaccine-related HPV types prior to vaccination were protected from clinical disease caused by the remaining vaccine HPV types.
Efficacy in subjects with and without prior infection or disease due to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18
The modified intention to treat (ITT) population included women regardless of baseline HPV status at Day 1, who received at least one vaccination and in whom case counting started at 1 month Postdose 1.
This population approximates to the general population of women with respect to prevalence of HPV infection or disease at enrolment.
The results are summarised in Table 2.

*Number of subjects with at least one follow-up visit after 30 days after Day 1 **Percent efficacy is calculated from the combined protocols.
The efficacy for HPV 16/ 18 related CIN 2/ 3 or AIS is based on data from protocols 005 (16-related endpoints only), 007, 013, and 015.
Patients were followed for up to 4 years (median 3.6 years).
Note: point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up.
Efficacy against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VIN 2/ 3 was 73.3% (95% CI:
40.3, 89.4), against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18-related VaIN 2/ 3 was 85.7% (95% CI:
37.6, 98.4), and against HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, 18- related genital warts was 80.3% (95% CI:
73.9, 85.3) in the combined protocols at end of study.
Overall 12% of the combined study population had an abnormal Pap test suggestive of CIN at Day 1.
Among subjects with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 who were naïve to the relevant vaccine HPV types at Day 1, efficacy of the vaccine remained high.
Among subjects with an abnormal Pap test at Day 1 who were already infected with the relevant vaccine HPV types at Day 1, no vaccine efficacy was observed.
20 Protection Against the Overall Burden of Cervical HPV disease in 16- Through 26-Year-Old Women
The impact of Gardasil against the overall risk for cervical, HPV disease (i. e., disease caused by any HPV type) was evaluated starting 30 days after the first dose in 17,599 subjects enrolled in the two phase III efficacy trials (Protocols 013 and 015).
Among subjects who were naïve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pap test at Day 1, administration of Gardasil reduced the incidence of CIN 2/ 3 or AIS caused by vaccine- or non-vaccine HPV types by 42.7% (95% CI:
23.7, 57.3) and of genital warts by 82.8% (95% CI:
74.3, 88.8)at end of study.
In the modified ITT population, the benefit of the vaccine with respect to the overall incidence of CIN 2/ 3 or AIS (caused by any HPV type) and of genital warts was much lower, with a reduction of 18.4% (95% CI:
7.0, 28.4) and 62.5% (95% CI:
54.0, 69.5), respectively, as Gardasil does not impact the course of infections or disease that are present at vaccination onset.
Impact on Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures
The impact of Gardasil on rates of Definitive Cervical Therapy Procedures regardless of causal HPV types was evaluated in 18,150 subjects enrolled in Protocol 007, Protocols 013 and 015.
In the HPV naïve population (naïve to 14 common HPV types and had a negative Pap test at Day 1), Gardasil reduced the proportion of women who experienced, a definitive cervical therapy procedure (Loop Electro-Excision Procedure or Cold-Knife Conization) by 41.9% (95% CI:
27.7, 53.5) at end of study.
In the ITT population the corresponding reduction was 23.9% (95% CI:
15.2, 31.7).
Cross-protective efficacy The efficacy of Gardasil against CIN (any grade) and CIN 2/ 3 or AIS caused by 10 non-vaccine HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) structurally related to HPV 16 or HPV 18 was evaluated in the combined Phase III efficacy database (N = 17,599) after a median follow-up of 3.7 years (at end of study).
Efficacy against disease endpoints caused by pre-specified combinations of non-vaccine HPV types was measured.
The studies were not powered to assess efficacy against disease caused by individual HPV types.
The primary analysis was done in type-specific populations that required women to be negative for the type being analyzed, but who could be positive for other HPV types (96% of the overall population).
The primary time point analysis after 3 years did not reach statistical significance for all pre-specified endpoints.
The final end-of-study results for the combined incidence of CIN 2/ 3 or AIS in this population after a median follow-up of 3.7 years are shown in Table 3.
For composite endpoints, statistically significant efficacy against disease was demonstrated against HPV types phylogenetically related to HPV 16 (primarily HPV 31) whereas no statistically significant efficacy was observed for HPV types phylogenetically related to HPV 18 (including HPV 45).
For the 10 individual HPV types, statistical significance was only reached for HPV 31.

Immunogenicity
Assays to Measure Immune Response
No minimum antibody level associated with protection has been identified for HPV vaccines.
The immunogenicity of Gardasil was assessed in 8,915 (Gardasil n = 4,666; placebo n = 4,249) women 18 to 26 years of age and 3,400 female (Gardasil n = 1,471; placebo n = 583) and male (Gardasil n = 1,071; placebo n = 275) adolescents 9 to 17 years of age.
Type-specific immunoassays, competitive Luminex-based immunoassay (cLIA), with type-specific standards were used to assess immunogenicity to each vaccine type.
This assay measures antibodies against a single neutralizing epitope for each individual HPV type.
Immune Responses to Gardasil
In the clinical studies, 99.9%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.6% of individuals who received Gardasil became anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18-seropositive respectively, by 1 month Postdose 3 across all age groups tested.
Gardasil induced high anti-HPV Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) 1 month Postdose 3 in all age groups tested.
Anti-HPV levels in placebo subjects who had cleared an HPV infection (seropositive and PCR negative) were substantially lower than those induced by the vaccine.
Furthermore, anti-HPV levels (GMTs) in vaccinated subjects remained at or above serostatus cut-off during the long-term follow-up of the phase III studies (see below under Persistence).
22 Bridging the Efficacy of Gardasil from Young Adult Women to Young Adolescents
A clinical study (Protocol 016) compared the immunogenicity of Gardasil in 10- to 15-year-old boys and girls to those in 16- to 23-year old adolescent and young women.
In the vaccine group, 99.1 to 100% became seropositive to all vaccine serotypes by 1 month Postdose 3.
Table 4 compares the 1 month Postdose 3 anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs in 9- to 15-year-old boys and girls with those in 16- to 26-year old young women.

GMT- Geometric mean titre in mMU/ ml (mMU = milli-Merck units)
Anti-HPV responses at Month 7 among 9- to 15-year-old girls and boys were non-inferior to anti-HPV responses in 16- to 26-year-old young women for whom efficacy was established in the phase III studies.
Immunogenicity was related to age and Month 7 anti-HPV levels were significantly higher in younger individuals below 12 years of age than in those above that age.
On the basis of this immunogenicity bridging, the efficacy of Gardasil in 9- to 15-year-old girls is inferred.
Immunogenicity and safety of Gardasil have been demonstrated in 9- to 15-year-old boys.
Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males.
Persistence
In Protocol 007 peak anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 GMTs were observed at Month 7.
The GMTs declined through Month 24 and then stabilized until at least Month 60.
The exact duration of immunity following a 3-dose series has not been established.
In phase III studies, at end of study 90%, 95%, 98% and 60% of subjects who received Gardasil in the per-protocol immunogenicity population were anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 and anti HPV 18 seropositive, respectively.
Subjects who were seronegative for anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 in the cLIA at end of study were still protected against clinical disease.
Evidence of Anamnestic (Immune Memory) Response
Evidence of an anamnestic response was seen in vaccinated individuals who were seropositive to relevant HPV type(s) prior to vaccination.
In addition, a subset of vaccinated individuals who received a challenge dose of Gardasil 5 years after the onset of vaccination, exhibited a rapid and strong anamnestic response that exceeded the anti-HPV GMTs observed 1 month Postdose 3.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Evaluation of pharmacokinetic studies is not required for vaccines.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
23 Single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity and local tolerance studies revealed no special hazards to humans.
Gardasil induced specific antibody responses against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in pregnant rats, following one or multiple intramuscular injections.
Antibodies against all four HPV types were transferred to the offspring during gestation and possibly during lactation.
There were no treatment- related effects on developmental signs, behaviour, reproductive performance, or fertility of the offspring.

Not all pack sizes are marketed.
6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Gardasil is available in a pre-filled syringe ready to use for intramuscular injection (IM), preferably in the deltoid area of the upper arm.

If 2 needles of different lengths are provided in the pack, choose the appropriate needle to ensure an IM administration depending on your patient’s size and weight.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration 24
prior to administration.
Discard the product if particulates are present or if it appears discoloured.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
Using the pre-filled syringe with needle guard (safety) device
The needle guard (safety) device consists of a plastic cylinder (needle guard) that, before the dose is given, covers the syringe barrel.
The needle guard covers the needle after injection to prevent needle stick injury.
When the injection is completed and the plunger is fully depressed, the plunger will engage the activation clips.
Upon release of the plunger, the plastic cylinder will rapidly move to cover the needle.
If no needle is available in the pack, use a needle not exceeding 25 mm in length to allow the needle guard to cover the needle completely.
Warning:
Prior to completion of the injection, avoid contact with the activation clips (as indicated by asterisks * in the first illustration) on the device to keep from prematurely covering the needle with the needle guard.
Note:
Ensure that the air bubbles are removed from the syringe before injection.
The labels can only be removed after vaccine injection and when the needle guard covers the needle.
Shake well before use.
Remove the syringe tip cap and the needle cap.
Screw the needle onto the syringe barrel in a clockwise direction while pressing in the 2 plastic beads to lock the needle securely onto the syringe.
Remove the needle shield.
Inject the full dose by slowly pushing the plunger forward until it cannot be pushed further.
Note:
Do not release the pressure on the plunger.
While maintaining pressure on the plunger, remove the syringe from the patient.
Release the plunger slowly.
The needle guard will rapidly move to cover the needle.
25 To remove the detachable labels, rotate the plunger until the coloured tab becomes visible.
Pull on the coloured tab while continuing to rotate the plunger as needed.
Using the pre-filled syringe without needle guard (safety) device
Shake well before use.
Attach the needle by twisting in a clockwise direction until the needle fits securely on the syringe.
Administer the entire dose as per standard protocol.

Further information
1.
WHAT GARDASIL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Gardasil is a vaccine.
Vaccination with Gardasil is intended to protect against diseases caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18.
These diseases include cervical cancer; pre-cancerous lesions of the female genitals (cervix, vulva and vagina); and genital warts.
HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for ~70% of cervical cancer cases and 70% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina.
HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of genital wart cases.
Gardasil cannot cause the diseases it protects against.
Gardasil produces type-specific antibodies and has been shown in clinical trials to prevent these HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related diseases in adult women 16-26 years of age.
The vaccine also produces antibodies in 9- to 15-year-old children and adolescents.
Whether these type-specific antibodies prevent disease in adult males has not been evaluated.
Gardasil should be used in accordance with official guidelines.
The most benefit from Gardasil is expected before infection with any of the Human Papillomavirus types covered by the vaccine.
However, in individuals who are already infected by one or more of the vaccine HPV types, the vaccine will protect against the remaining vaccine related HPV types.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GARDASIL
Do not use Gardasil if:
the person to be vaccinated
 is allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of Gardasil (listed under “other ingredients”– see section 6).  has developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Gardasil.
49  suffers from an illness with high fever.
However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for example cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.
Take special care with Gardasil:
You should tell your doctor if the person to be vaccinated:
 has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example haemophilia  has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect or HIV infection
As with any vaccine, Gardasil may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine.
Gardasil will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus.
Therefore appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.
Gardasil will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus.
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening.
You should continue to follow your doctor’s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and protective measures.
What other important information should I know about Gardasil?
The duration of protection is currently unknown.
Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to determine whether a booster dose is needed.
Taking other medicines:
Gardasil can be given with Hepatitis B vaccine at a separate injection site (another part of your body, e.g. the other arm or leg) at the same visit.
Gardasil may not have an optimal effect if:
 used with medicines that suppress the immune system.
In clinical trials, oral or other contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Gardasil.
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if the person for whom the vaccine is intended is taking or has recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding:
Consult your doctor if the person to be vaccinated is pregnant, trying to become pregnant or becomes pregnant during the course of vaccination.
Gardasil may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.
Driving and using machines:
There is no information to suggest that Gardasil affects your ability to drive or use machinery.
3.
HOW TO USE GARDASIL
50 Gardasil is given as an injection by your doctor.
The person to be vaccinated will receive three doses of the vaccine.
First injection: at chosen date Second injection: ideally 2 months after first injection Third injection: ideally 6 months after first injection
The dosing schedule can be more flexible, please speak to your doctor for more information.
The person to be vaccinated should complete the three-dose vaccination course; otherwise the person to be vaccinated may not be fully protected.
Gardasil will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the upper arm or thigh).
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines and solutions.
If you forget to take Gardasil:
If you miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits for the follow-up doses.
If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all vaccines and medicines, Gardasil can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
The following side effects can be seen after the use of Gardasil:
Very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients), side effects found at the injection site include: pain, swelling and redness.
Fever was also seen.
Commonly (more than 1 in 100 patients), side effects found at the injection site include: bruising, itching.
Very rarely (less than 1 in 10,000 patients), difficulty breathing (bronchospasm) has been reported.
Rarely (less than 1 in 1000 patients), hives (urticaria).
Side effects that have been reported during marketed use include:
Fainting, sometimes accompanied by shaking or stiffening, has been reported.
Although fainting episodes are uncommon, patients should be observed for 15 minutes after they receive HPV vaccine.
Allergic reactions that may include difficulty breathing, wheezing (bronchospasm), hives and rash have been reported.
Some of these reactions have been severe.
As with other vaccines, side effects that have been reported during general use include: swollen glands (neck, armpit, or groin), Guillain-Barré Syndrome (muscle weakness, abnormal sensations, tingling in the arms, legs and upper body), dizziness and headache, nausea and vomiting, joint pain, aching muscles, unusual tiredness or weakness, and generally feeling unwell.
51 If any of the side effects gets serious or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
5.

 Gardasil is available in a pre-filled syringe, with needle guard (safety device) ready to use for intramuscular injection (IM), preferably in the deltoid area of the upper arm.  If 2 needles of different lengths are provided in the pack, choose the appropriate needle to ensure an IM administration depending on your patient’s size and weight.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration 60 prior to administration.
Discard the product if particulates are present or if it appears discoloured.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
The needle guard (safety) device consists of a plastic cylinder (needle guard) that, before the dose is given, covers the syringe barrel.
The needle guard covers the needle after injection to prevent needle stick injury.
When the injection is completed and the plunger is fully depressed, the plunger will engage the activation clips.
Upon release of the plunger, the plastic cylinder will rapidly move to cover the needle.
If no needle is available in the pack, use a needle not exceeding 25 mm in length to allow the needle guard to cover the needle completely.
Warning:
Prior to completion of the injection, avoid contact with the activation clips (as indicated by asterisks * in the first illustration) on the device to keep from prematurely covering the needle with the needle guard.
Note:
Ensure that the air bubbles are removed from the syringe before injection.
The labels can only be removed after vaccine injection and when the needle guard covers the needle.
Shake well before use.
Remove the syringe tip cap and the needle cap.
Screw the needle onto the syringe barrel in a clockwise direction while pressing in the 2 plastic beads to lock the needle securely onto the syringe.
Remove the needle shield.
Inject the full dose by slowly pushing the plunger forward until it cannot be pushed further.
Note:
Do not release the pressure on the plunger.
While maintaining pressure on the plunger, remove the syringe from the patient.
Release the plunger slowly.
The needle guard will rapidly move to cover the needle.
61 To remove the detachable labels, rotate the plunger until the coloured tab becomes visible.
Pull on the coloured tab while continuing to rotate the plunger as needed.

1.
WHAT GARDASIL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Gardasil is a vaccine.
Vaccination with Gardasil is intended to protect against diseases caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18.
These diseases include cervical cancer; pre-cancerous lesions of the female genitals (cervix, vulva and vagina); and genital warts.
HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for ~70% of cervical cancer cases and 70% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina.
HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of genital wart cases.
Gardasil cannot cause the diseases it protects against.
Gardasil produces type-specific antibodies and has been shown in clinical trials to prevent these HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, and 18-related diseases in adult women 16-26 years of age.
The vaccine also produces antibodies in 9- to 15-year-old children and adolescents.
Whether these type-specific antibodies prevent disease in adult males has not been evaluated.
Gardasil should be used in accordance with official guidelines.
The most benefit from Gardasil is expected before infection with any of the Human Papillomavirus types covered by the vaccine.
However, in individuals who are already infected by one or more of the vaccine HPV types, the vaccine will protect against the remaining vaccine related HPV types.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GARDASIL
Do not use Gardasil if:
the person to be vaccinated
 is allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of Gardasil (listed under “other ingredients”– see section 6).  has developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of Gardasil.
64  suffers from an illness with high fever.
However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for example cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.
Take special care with Gardasil:
You should tell your doctor if the person to be vaccinated:
 has a bleeding disorder (a disease that makes you bleed more than normal), for example haemophilia  has a weakened immune system, for example due to a genetic defect or HIV infection
As with any vaccine, Gardasil may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine.
Gardasil will not protect against every type of Human Papillomavirus.
Therefore appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted disease should continue to be used.
Gardasil will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus.
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening.
You should continue to follow your doctor’s advice on cervical smear/Pap tests and preventative and protective measures.
What other important information should I know about Gardasil?
The duration of protection is currently unknown.
Longer term follow-up studies are ongoing to determine whether a booster dose is needed.
Taking other medicines:
Gardasil can be given with Hepatitis B vaccine at a separate injection site (another part of your body, e.g. the other arm or leg) at the same visit.
Gardasil may not have an optimal effect if:
 used with medicines that suppress the immune system.
In clinical trials, oral or other contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Gardasil.
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if the person for whom the vaccine is intended is taking or has recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding:
Consult your doctor if the person to be vaccinated is pregnant, trying to become pregnant or becomes pregnant during the course of vaccination.
Gardasil may be given to women who are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed.
Driving and using machines:
There is no information to suggest that Gardasil affects your ability to drive or use machinery.
3.
HOW TO USE GARDASIL
65 Gardasil is given as an injection by your doctor.
The person to be vaccinated will receive three doses of the vaccine.
First injection: at chosen date Second injection: ideally 2 months after first injection Third injection: ideally 6 months after first injection
The dosing schedule can be more flexible, please speak to your doctor for more information.
The person to be vaccinated should complete the three-dose vaccination course; otherwise the person to be vaccinated may not be fully protected.
Gardasil will be given as an injection through the skin into the muscle (preferably the muscle of the upper arm or thigh).
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines and solutions.
If you forget to take Gardasil:
If you miss a scheduled injection, your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose.
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits for the follow-up doses.
If you forget or are not able to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
