Error loading: %1
When connecting to: %1
Check the address for errors such as ww. kde. org instead of www. kde. org
If the address is correct, try to check the network connection.
If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that rekonq is permitted to access the network.
Of course, if rekonq does not work properly, you can always say it is a programmer error;)
