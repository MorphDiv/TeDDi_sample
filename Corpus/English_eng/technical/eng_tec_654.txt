XML filter
.
DocType
Enter the DOCTYPE of the XML file.
For example, the DOCTYPE defined for the current DocBook XML filter is:
-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN
The resulting line in the XML document is:
< !DOCTYPE article PUBLIC &quot; -//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN &quot; &quot; http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd &quot; >
DTD
If you want, enter the public or system identifier of the DTD (Document Type Definition) that you want to use.
If present, both identifiers are written to the DOCTYPE declaration in saved XML files.
The public identifier is used to detect the filter when you open a file without specifying a filter.
Browse
Opens a file selection dialogue box.
XSLT for export
If this is an export filter, enter the file name of the XSLT stylesheet that you want to use for exporting.
XSLT for import
If this is an import filter, enter the file name of the XSLT stylesheet that you want to use for importing.
Template for import
Enter the name of the template that you want to use for importing.
In the template, styles are defined to display XML tags.
Tools - Options - $[officename] - Paths
.
When you open an XML file whose filter uses the template, the template opens first.
In the template, you can map $[officename] styles to display XML tags in the XML document.
