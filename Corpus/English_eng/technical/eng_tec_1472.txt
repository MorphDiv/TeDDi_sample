Opening a Dialogue Box With Program Code
%PRODUCTNAME
BASIC window for a dialogue box that you created, leave the dialogue box editor by clicking the name tab of the Module that the dialogue box is assigned to.
The name tab is at the bottom of the window.
Dialog1Show
.
In this example, the name of the dialogue box that you created is &quot; Dialog1 &quot; :
Sub Dialog1Show
BasicLibraries.LoadLibrary( &quot; Tools &quot; )
LoadDialog
( &quot; Standard &quot; , &quot; Dialog1 &quot; )
oDialog1.Execute()
End Sub
Without using &quot; LoadDialog &quot; you can call the code as follows:
Sub Dialog1Show
DialogLibraries.LoadLibrary( &quot; Standard &quot; )
oDialog1 = CreateUnoDialog( DialogLibraries.Standard.Dialog1 )
oDialog1.Execute()
End Sub
When you execute this code, &quot; Dialog1 &quot; opens.
To close the dialogue box, click the close button (x) on its title bar.
