Date & Time Functions
These spreadsheet functions are used for inserting and editing dates and times.
The functions whose names end with _ADD return the same results as the corresponding Microsoft Excel functions.
Use the functions without _ADD to obtain results based on international standards.
For example, the WEEKNUM function calculates the week number of a given date based on international standard ISO 6801, while WEEKNUM_ADD returns the same week number as Microsoft Excel.
Format Cells
.
The
Numbers
tab page contains the functions for defining the number format.
Date base for day zero
Dates are calculated as offsets from a starting day zero.
You can set the day zero to be one of the following:
Date base
Use
'30/12/1899'
(default)
'01/01/1900'
(used in former StarCalc 1.0)
'01/01/1904'
(used in Apple software)
Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME Calc - Calculate
to select the date base.
When you copy and paste cells containing date values between different spreadsheets, both spreadsheet documents must be set to the same date base.
If date bases differ, the displayed date values will change!
Two digits years
Tools - Options - $[officename] - General
you find the area
Year (two digits)
.
This sets the period for which two-digit information applies.
Note that changes made here have an effect on some of the following functions.
When entering dates, slashes or dashes used as date separators may be interpreted as arithmetical operators.
Therefore, dates entered in this format are not always recognised as dates and result in erroneous calculations.
To keep dates from being interpreted as parts of formulae, place them in quotation marks, for example, &quot; 20/07/54 &quot; .
