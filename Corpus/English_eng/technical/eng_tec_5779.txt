Using & kturtle;
Here is a screenshot of & kturtle; in action
& kturtle; Main Window
The main window of & kturtle; has three main parts: the editor (1) on the left where you type the & turtlescript; commands, the the canvas (2) on the right where the turtle make your drawing, and the inspector (3) which gives you information when your program executes. Besides these you find the menu bar (5) from where all the actions can be reached, the toolbar (4) that allows you to quickly select the most used actions, the Console, that you can use to enter a one line command to test it, and the statusbar (along the bottom of the window) where you will find feedback on the state of & kturtle;.
The Editor
In the editor you type the & turtlescript; commands. Most of functions of the editor can be found in the File and Edit menus. The editor can be docked on each border of the main window or it can be detached and placed anywhere on your desktop.
You have several ways to get some code in the editor. The easiest way is to use an example: choose File Examples in the File menu and select an example. The file example you choose will be opened in the the editor, you can then use Run Run from the menubar or the Run from the toolbar to run the code if you like.
You can open & turtlescript; files by choosing File Open....
The third way is to directly type your own code in the editor or to copy/ paste some code.
The Canvas
The canvas is the domain of the turtle, here the turtle draws according to the commands it gets. After getting some code in the Editor and executing it, two things can happen: either the code executes fine, and will you most likely see something change on the canvas; or you have made an error in your code in that case the error tab will appear explaining you what mistake you made.
You can zoom in and out the canvas with your mouse wheel.
The Inspector
The inspector informs you about the variables, the learned functions and show the code tree while the program is running.
The inspector can be docked on each border of the main window or it can be detached and placed anywhere on your desktop.
The Toolbar
Here you can quickly reach the most used actions. The Toolbar also contains the Console where you can quickly invoke commands, this might be useful in case you want to test a command without modifying the content of the Editor.
You can configure the toolbar using Settings Configure Toolbars... to better fit your preferences.
The Menubar
In the menubar you find all the actions of & kturtle;. They are in the following groups: File, Edit, Canvas, Run, Tools, Settings, and Help. This section describes them all.

Present a list of possible execution speeds, consisting of: Full Speed, Slow, Slower, Slowest and Step-by-Step. When the execution speed is set to Full Speed (default) we can barely keep up with what is happening. Sometimes this behavior is wanted, but sometimes we want to keep track of the execution. In the latter case you want to set the execution speed to Slow, Slower or Slowest. When one of the slow modes is selected the current position of the executor will be shown in the editor. Step-by-Step will execute one command at a time.

F2 Help Help on:...
This is a very useful function: it provides help on the code where the cursor in the editor is at. So, & eg;, you have used the print command in your code, and you want to read and to know what the handbook says on this command. You just move your cursor so it is in the print command and you press F2. The handbook will then show all info on the print command.
This function can prove to be useful while learning & turtlescript;.
The Statusbar
On the status bar you get feedback of the state of & kturtle;. On the left side it shows the feedback on the last action. On the right side you find the current location of the cursor (line and column numbers). In the middle of the status bar is indicated the current language used for the commands.
The cursor position is indicated in the statusbar, on the right with the Line number and Column number.
This message should help you to resolve the error.

Save the current canvas as a picture.
The View Menu
Show or hide the Code Editor.

This action opens the color picker. Using the color picker you can easily select a color code and insert it in the code editor.
Ctrl; I Tools Indent
This action indents (adds white space at the beginning of) the lines that are selected. When indentation is used properly this can make code much easier to read. All examples use indentation, please check them out.
