The following conditions can apply:
The document is not locked by any other user.
This document will be opened for read and write access by user A.

The document is marked as &quot; read-only &quot; by the file system.
This document will be opened in read-only mode.
Editing is not allowed.
User A can save the document using another document name or another path.
User A can edit this copy.
The document is locked by another user.
User A sees a dialogue box that tells the user the document is locked.
