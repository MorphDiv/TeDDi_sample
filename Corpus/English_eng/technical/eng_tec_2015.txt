Consolidating Data
During consolidation, the content of the cells from several sheets will be combined in one place.
To Combine Cell Contents

The function specifies how the values of the consolidation ranges are linked.
The &quot; Sum &quot; function is the default setting.

Link to source data
to insert the formulae that generate the results in the target range, rather than the actual results.
If you link the data, any values modified in the source range are automatically updated in the target range.
The corresponding cell references in the target range are inserted in consecutive rows, which are automatically ordered and then hidden from view.
Only the final result, based on the selected function, is displayed.
Consolidate by
, select either
Row labels
or
Column labels
if the cells of the source data range are not to be consolidated corresponding to the identical position of the cell in the range, but instead according to a matching row label or column label.
To consolidate by row labels or column labels, the label must be contained in the selected source ranges.
The text in the labels must be identical, so that rows or columns can be accurately matched.
If the row or column label does not match any that exist in the target range, it will be appended as a new row or column.
The data from the consolidation ranges and target range will be saved when you save the document.
If you later open a document in which consolidation has been defined, this data will again be available.
