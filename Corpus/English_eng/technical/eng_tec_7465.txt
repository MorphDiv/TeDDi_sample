CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Cats.
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
For active immunisation of cats, of 1 month of age or older to reduce clinical signs of Bordetella bronchiseptica associated upper respiratory tract disease.
Onset of immunity:
Onset of immunity was established in 8 week old cats as early as 72 hours after vaccination.
Duration of immunity:
The duration of immunity is up to 1 year.
No data on the influence of maternal antibodies on the effect of vaccination with Nobivac Bb for cats are available.
From literature it is considered that this type of intranasal vaccine is able to induce an immune response without interference from maternally derived antibodies.
4.3 Contra-indications
None known.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
If any antibiotic is administered within one week after vaccination, the vaccination should be repeated after the antibiotic treatment has been completed.
Vaccinated animals can spread the Bordetella bronchispetica vaccine strain for six weeks; in individual cases for at least one year.
Intermittent spreading is possible as well.
2 4.5 Special precaution(s) for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Only healthy cats should be vaccinated.
Sneezing by cats after administration does not adversely affect the efficacy of the product.
Do not administer during antibiotic treatment or in conjunction with any other intranasal products.
Vaccinated animals can spread the vaccine strain of Bordetella bronchiseptica for six weeks, and there may be intermittent shedding for at least one year.
Although the risk of immunocompromised humans becoming infected with Bordetella bronchiseptica is extremely low, it is advised that cats, which are in close contact with immunocompromised humans are not vaccinated with this vaccine.
Dogs, pigs and unvaccinated cats may react to the vaccine strain with mild and transient respiratory signs.
Other animals, such as rabbits and small rodents, have not been tested.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-administration, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Appropriate disinfection procedures should be used following use of this live bacterial vaccine.
Although the risk that immunocompromised humans become infected with Bordetella bronchiseptica is extremely low, such individuals should be aware that cats can shed the organism for up to 1 year after vaccination.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Occasionally sneezing, coughing, mild and transient discharge from the eyes or nose.
In animals, which show more severe signs, appropriate antibiotic treatment may be indicated.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in pregnant or lactating queens.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy from the use of this vaccine with any other.
It is therefore recommended that no other vaccine should be administered within 14 days before or after vaccination with the product.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Vaccination scheme:
One dose, of 0.2 ml of reconstituted vaccine at least 72 hours prior to period of anticipated risk.
Allow the solvent to reach room temperature (15 - 25°C).
Aseptically reconstitute the freeze-dried vaccine with 0.3 ml of the sterile solvent provided.
Shake well after addition of the solvent.
Withdraw 0.2 ml of reconstituted vaccine into a 1 ml or 2 ml syringe, remove the needle and administer the whole contents of the syringe into one of the cat’ s nostrils.
3 The head of the cat should be held with its nose pointing upwards and its mouth closed, so that it is forced to breathe through its nostrils.
Place the syringe in front of one of the nostrils and carefully administer the whole contents of the syringe into the nasal cavity via this nostril.
The vaccine is administered directly from the tip of the syringe onto the opening of the nostril and enters the nasal cavity during inhalation.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Occasionally sneezing, coughing, mild and transient discharge from the eyes or nose, particularly in very young susceptible kittens.
In animals, which show more severe signs, appropriate antibiotic treatment may be indicated.
