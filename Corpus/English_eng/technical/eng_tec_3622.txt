mb_detect_order() sets automatic character encoding detection order to encoding-list.
It returns TRUE for success, FALSE for failure.
encoding-list is array or comma separated list of character encoding. ("auto "is expanded to "ASCII, JIS, UTF-8, EUC-JP, SJIS")
If encoding-list is omitted, it returns current character encoding detection order as array.
This setting affects mb_detect_encoding() and mb_send_mail().
If there is a invalid byte sequence for following encoding, encoding detection will fail.
Note:
UTF-8, UTF-7, ASCII, EUC-JP, SJIS, eucJP-win, SJIS-win, JIS, ISO-2022-JP
For ISO-8859-*, mbstring always detects as ISO-8859-*.
For UTF-16, UTF-32, UCS2 and UCS4, encoding detection will fail always.
Example 1.
Useless detect order example
; Always detect as ISO-8859-1 detect_order = ISO-8859-1, UTF-8; Always detect as UTF-8, since ASCII / UTF-7 values are; valid for UTF-8 detect_order = UTF-8, ASCII, UTF-7
Example 2. mb_detect_order() examples
/* Set detection order by enumerated list * / mb_detect_order( "eucjp-win,sjis-win,UTF-8"); / * Set detection order by array * / $ary[] = "ASCII"; $ary[] = "JIS"; $ary[] = "EUC-JP"; mb_detect_order($ary); / * Display current detection order * / echo implode(", ", mb_detect_order());
