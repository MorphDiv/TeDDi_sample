Configure Resources
& knotes; can use multiple resources for loading and storing its contacts.

Load the configuration module you want to add your resource(s) to by selecting it from the drop down box at the top of the Resources section. The module for configuring & knotes; 's resources is Notes.
Launch the Resource Configuration dialog by pushing the Add... button. Choose the resource you want to add to your Notes module and click OK to confirm your choice.
Notes in Local File
All notes will be stored in a local file
IMAP Server via & kmail;
This resource stores notes as messages on an IMAP server. & kmail; is used to access the IMAP server, therefore, if you use this type of resource, & kmail; will open whenever you access the address book, if it (or & kontact;) are not already running.
Notes on Scalix Server via & kmail;
To be written
eGroupware Server (via XML-RPC)
After selecting the type of resource another dialog appears where you can configure the resource-specific settings.
& knotes; needs a standard resource, where all contacts should be saved if no other resource is specified; for this reason, after starting & knotes; the first time, there is already a resource available. If you want to use another resource as the standard resource, use the Use as Standard button to select it. You must have both read and write access to the new standard resource, otherwise you will not be able to select it.
