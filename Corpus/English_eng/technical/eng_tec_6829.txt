About Neuromuscular Profile
Load = Average eccentric RFD (Ratio of Force Development)
Explode = Average relative concentric RFD
Drive = Average relative concentric Impulse
General trends to try to develop an 'equilibrated' neuromuscular profile (always add individual considerations as previous or actual injuries, sport specificity, muscular chains, etc.).
If one of the metrics is under developed (weak) compared with the other two, prescribe exercises that emphasize its development.
If one of the metrics is over developed (extreme) compared with the other two, prescribe exercises to emphasize those, but paying attention to flexibility and relaxation of over working muscles.
General guidelines to improve the neuromuscular profile:
Load: Perform exercises that develop maximum force (eccentric, isometric or concentric).
Then switch to exercises that develop eccentric force in short time.
Explode: Perform exercises that develop force in short time, and maximum force.
Drive: Perform exercises where force is developed during more time.
Analysis uses the best three jumps using 'jump height' criterion.

On RSA tests, rest time counts as a "track".
You should write the time in seconds after a capital 'R' (meaning "Rest").
Eg. Aziz et al. (2000) test repeats 8 times the following sequence:
Run 40 meters, rest 30 seconds.
Will be limited by tracks with a fixed value of 16
because there are 16 tracks:
2 different tracks: ('Run' and 'rest') x 8 times
And the 'distance' of each different track will be:

Short description
Subjects had to walk over the bar as fast as possible.
From one platform to another without falling down.
If they touched the ground they had to continue.
The hands were on their waist.
Without shoes.
Every ground contact is penalized with 2 seconds.
The best of 2 attempts were recorded.
Gesell's Bar
Length: 2.5 m.
Wide: 4 cm.
Protocol
CONDITIONS:
Hands on their waist.
In front of a wall in order to avoid distractions.
INSTRUCTIONS AND DEMONSTRATION:
You have to walk on this bar as fast as possible 'like this', if you touch the ground just continue.
'Like this' means normal, with a foot in front of the other, not side by side.
SCORE:
Time will start since first platform is touched, and will stop when second platform is reached.
The best of 2 attempts will be recorded.

20Yard Agility test
This test is part of a battery for the USA Women's Soccer Team. The NFL use a very similar test for the NFL Combine Testing, the 20 yard shuttle.
Purpose
The 20 yard agility run is a simple measure of an athlete’s ability to accelerate, decelerate, change direction, and to accelerate again.
Procedure
Set up three marker cones in a straight line, exactly five yards apart - cones B, A(center) and C. At each cone place a line across using marking tape. The timer is positioned at the level of the center A cone, facing the athlete. The athlete straddles the center cone A with feet an equal distance apart and parallel to the line of cones. When ready, the athlete runs to cone B (touching the line with either foot), turns and accelerates to cone C (touching the line), and finishes by accelerating through the line at cone A. The stopwatch is started on the first movement of the athlete and stops the watch when the athlete’s torso crosses the center line.
Scoring
Record the best time of two trials.
Encourage athletes to accelerate through the finish line to maximize their result.
Cited with permission.
505 Agility test
Markers are set up 5 and 15 meters from a line marked on the ground. The athlete runs from the 15 meter marker towards the line (run in distance to build up speed) and through the 5 m markers, turns on the line and runs back through the 5 m markers. The time is recorded from when the athletes first runs through the 5 meter marker, and stopped when they return through these markers (that is, the time taken to cover the 5 m up and back distance - 10 m total). The best of two trails is recorded. The turning ability on each leg should be tested. The subject should be encouraged to not overstep the line by too much, as this will increase their time.
This is a test of 180 degree turning ability. This ability may not be applicable to some sports.
Illinois Agility test
The length of the course is 10 meters and the width (distance between the start and finish points) is 5 meters. Four cones are used to mark the start, finish and the two turning points. Another four cones are placed down the center an equal distance apart. Each cone in the center is spaced 3.3 meters apart.
Subjects should lie on their front (head to the start line) and hands by their shoulders. On the 'Go' command the stopwatch is started, and the athlete gets up as quickly as possible and runs around the course in the direction indicated, without knocking the cones over, to the finish line, at which the timing is stopped.
The table below gives some rating scores (in seconds) for the test
Rating

Females
Excellent
Good
Average
Fair
Poor
Advantages
This is a simple test to administer, requiring little equipment. Can test players ability to turn in different directions, and different angles.
Disadvantages
Choice of footwear and surface of area can effect times greatly. Results can be subject to timing inconsistencies, which may be overcome by using timing gates. Cannot distinguish between left and right turning ability.
Variations
The starting and finishing sides can be swapped, so that turning direction is changed.
Shuttle Run Agility test
This test describes the procedures as used in the President's Challenge Fitness Awards. The variations listed give other ways to also perform this test.
This is a test of speed and agility, important in many sports.
This test requires the person to run back and forth between two parallel lines as fast as possible. Set up two lines of cones 30 feet apart or use line markings, and place two blocks of wood or a similar object behind one of the lines. Starting at the line opposite the blocks, on the signal 'Ready? Go!' the participant runs to the other line, picks up a block and returns to place it behind the starting line, then returns to pick up the second block, then runs with it back across the line.
Two or more trails may be performed, and the quickest time is recorded. Results are recorded to the nearest tenth of a second.
Modifications
The test procedure can be varied by changing the number of shuttles performed, the distance between turns (some use 10 meters rather than 30 feet) and by removing the need for the person pick up and return objects from the turning points.
This test can be conducted on large groups relatively quickly with minimal equipment required.
The blocks should be placed at the line, not thrown across them. Also make sure the participants run through the finish line to maximize their score.
ZigZag Agility test
Similar to the Shuttle Run test, this test requires the athlete to run a course in the shortest possible time. A standard zig zag course is with four cones placed on the corners of a rectangle 10 by 16 feet, with one more cone placed in the centre. If the cones are labelled 1 to 4 around the rectangle going along the longer side first, and the centre cone is C, the test begins at 1, then to C, 2, 3, C, 4, then back to 1.
This test procedure can be modified by changing the distance between cones, and the number of circuits performed.
The total distance run should not be too great so that fatigue does not become a factor.

Modified time Getup and Go test
The instructions given to perform the test were as follows: "Sit down with your back resting on the back of the chair and with your two arms resting on your legs. When you hear the word 'go', stand up without using your arms, kick the ball in front of you as hard as you possibly can, using the instep of the foot you feel the safest. Then walk at your normal pace while counting backwards from 15 to 0 out loud. Turn around back the cone, without touching it, and go back to your seat, stepping into the circles, trying not to touch any of them. Finally, sit down again, trying not to use your arms".
The stopwatches were activated on the word 'go' and the button that saved the time intervals was pressed also after the following stages: when the subject stood up and kicked the ball; when the ball passed the 8 m line; and when the subject returned to the seated position in the same chair (42 cm height from the seat to the ground). The total time needed to perform the test provided a quantitative evaluation of performance. A qualitative evaluation was performed by the completion of an AQ. This AQ assesses 6 items with a Likert scale from 0 to 3, where 0 is the equivalent to needing help in order to perform the task, and 3 is equivalent to performing the task unaided with no mistakes. The maximum points that can be attained are 18. The items assessed were: (1) standing up from the chair, (2) kicking the ball, (3) walking whilst counting backwards from 15 to 0, (4) walking around the cone, (5) walking whilst stepping into the circles, and (6) sitting back down again.
Assessment questionnaire
