(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns the time the file was last accessed, or FALSE in case of an error.
The time is returned as a Unix timestamp.
The results of this function are cached.
See clearstatcache() for more details.
Note:
The atime of a file is supposed to change whenever the data blocks of a file are being read.
This can be costly performancewise when an application regularly accesses a very large number of files or directories.
Some Unix filesystems can be mounted with atime updates disabled to increase the performance of such applications; USENET news spools are a common example.
On such filesystems this function will be useless.
This function will not work on remote files; the file to be examined must be accessible via the server's filesystem.
