(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns string with all alphabetic characters converted to lowercase.
Note that 'alphabetic' is determined by the current locale.
This means that in i.e. the default "C" locale, characters such as umlaut-A (Ã„) will not be converted.
Example 1. strtolower() example
$str = "Mary Had A Little Lamb and She LOVED It So"; $str = strtolower($str); print $str; # Prints mary had a little lamb and she loved it so
