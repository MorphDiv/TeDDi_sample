Introduction
Gametype:
Card, Arcade
Number of possible players:
Two
Lieutnant Skat (from German Offiziersskat) is a fun and engaging card game for two players, where the second player is either live opponent, or built in artificial intelligence.
The game is played using a single deck of cards. Cards are shuffled and distributed amongst the players in such a way that half of them are face down and half of them are open. Each participant plays one of the open cards per turn. As soon as all the cards are played the round ends and points are calculated and awarded.
How to Play
Objective:
Score more than 60 points in a single game.
Once dealing is finished each player ends up with 16 cards each. Cards are displayed in two vertical rows - four cards per row. Half of the cards are face down and half are face up. As a player you can see the cards of your opponent as well as your own. You can make a move then by clicking on any of your cards which are currently face up. The opponent has to reply by choosing a corresponding card form his/ her own stack. Note If your opponent is artificial intelligence, its cards will be chosen automatically. Once the exchange is finished values of the played cards are evaluated and either you or your opponent is awarded points. The game is complete in 16 rounds (when all of your and your opponent's cards have been played). After the game ends your score is being compared to that of your opponent and the player with the higher score wins the round.

Strategies and Tips
When the game starts, the starting player should play any of the face up cards from own stack. If the second player currently has face up cards that are of the same suit as the card played, he/ she has to reply with one of those cards. If, however, the second player does not have a card of the same suit, he/ she can play with any other card. The player with the higher card value wins both cards. Note If the replying player plays'trump 'card he/ she wins both cards. Note If the leading player plays'trump' card he/ she wins both cards. The player who wins the round leads the next one.

The Jack of clubs does not count as club but as trump.
The second player has following choices:
The second player has in his/ her open cards the same suit. He/ she has to play one of this suit then. The player with the higher card (see table below) wins both cards.
The second player does not have a card of the played suit. He/ she can now play any other card. If it is a trump the second player will win both cards. Otherwise the first player will win both cards.

Remote connections
It is possible to play the game over a network connection with another computer. To do so both players on both computers have to select one color played by the local player and the other by the remote player. Who chooses which side does not matter. It even does not matter if both choose to play the same player as this will automatically be interchanged by the game.
One of the computers will act as game server. Only this one can start a new network game. Also all its game data will be transfered to the client computer. You can force your computer to be server if you do not supply a hostname in the network dialog. This dialog pops up if you start a new network game. As a client you enter the hostname of the machine on which the server is running. The port does not usually need to be changed, but you can enter any valid port number there.
Menus
Starts a new game. In a network game this option is only available for the network server. The network client will be automatically started by the server.
