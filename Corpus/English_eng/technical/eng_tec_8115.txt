CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of essential hypertension.
MicardisPlus fixed dose combination (40 mg telmisartan/ 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on telmisartan alone.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults MicardisPlus should be taken once daily with liquid, with or without food in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by telmisartan alone.
Individual dose titration with each of the two components is recommended before changing to the fixed dose combination.
When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combination may be considered.
• MicardisPlus 40 mg/ 12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by Micardis 40 mg • MicardisPlus 80 mg/ 12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by Micardis 80 mg
Renal impairment:
Periodic monitoring of renal function is advised (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment:
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed MicardisPlus 40 mg/ 12.5 mg once daily.
MicardisPlus is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 4.4).
Elderly:
No dosage adjustment is necessary.
Children and adolescents:
MicardisPlus is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to any of the active substances or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1).
2 • Hypersensitivity to other sulphonamide-derived substances (since hydrochlorothiazide is a sulphonamide-derived medicinal product). • Second and third trimester of pregnancy and lactation (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). • Cholestasis and biliary obstructive disorders. • Severe hepatic impairment. • Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min). • Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Pregnancy Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).
Hepatic impairment:
MicardisPlus should not be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe hepatic insufficiency (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile.
These patients can be expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan.
In addition, MicardisPlus should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.
There is no clinical experience with MicardisPlus in patients with hepatic impairment.
Renovascular hypertension:
There is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation:
MicardisPlus should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min) (see section 4.3).
There is no experience regarding the administration of MicardisPlus in patients with recent kidney transplantation.
Experience with MicardisPlus is modest in the patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, therefore periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended.
Thiazide diuretic- associated azotaemia may occur in patients with impaired renal function.
Intravascular hypovolaemia:
Symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/ or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting.
Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of MicardisPlus.
Other conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system:
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Primary aldosteronism:
Patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.
Therefore, the use of MicardisPlus is not recommended.
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:
As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
3 Metabolic and endocrine effects:
Thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance.
In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents may be required.
Latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.
An increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels has been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; however, at the 12.5 mg dose contained in MicardisPlus, minimal or no effects were reported.
Hyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in some patients receiving thiazide therapy.
Electrolyte imbalance:
As for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals.
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia and hypochloraemic alkalosis).
Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are dryness of mouth, thirst, asthenia, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea or vomiting (see section 4.8).
- Hypokalaemia
Although hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with telmisartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia.
The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients with cirrhosis of liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see section 4.5).
- Hyperkalaemia
Conversely, due to the antagonism of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptors by the telmisartan component of MicardisPlus, hyperkalaemia might occur.
Although clinically significant hyperkalaemia has not been documented with MicardisPlus, risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include renal insufficiency and/ or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus.
Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with MicardisPlus (see section 4.5).
- Hyponatraemia and hypochloraemic alkalosis
There is no evidence that MicardisPlus would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia.
Chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment.
- Hypercalcaemia
Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism.
Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism.
Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.
- Hypomagnesaemia
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in hypomagnesaemia (see section 4.5).
Sorbitol and Lactose Monohydrate:
This medicinal product contains lactose monohydrate and sorbitol.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance and/ or with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
Ethnic differences:
As with all other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, telmisartan is apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black patients than in non blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low renin states in the black hypertensive population.
4 Other:
As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.
General:
Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history.
Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide diuretics.
Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8).
If a photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment.
If a re- administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
Lithium:
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
Rare cases have also been reported with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including MicardisPlus).
Co- administration of lithium and MicardisPlus is not recommended (see section 4.4).
If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is recommended during concomitant use.
Medicinal products associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e. g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, corticosteroids, ACTH, amphotericin, carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium, salicylic acid and derivatives):
If these substances are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
These medicinal products may potentiate the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium (see section 4.4).
Medicinal products that may increase potassium levels or induce hyperkalaemia (e. g.
ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, cyclosporin or other medicinal products such as heparin sodium):
If these medicinal products are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
Based on the experience with the use of other medicinal products that blunt the renin- angiotensin system, concomitant use of the above medicinal products may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).
Medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances:
Periodic monitoring of serum potassium and ECG is recommended when MicardisPlus is administered with these medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e. g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics) and the following torsades de pointes inducing medicinal products (which include some antiarrhythmics), hypokalaemia being a predisposing factor to torsades de pointes.
- class Ia antiarrythmics (e. g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide)
- class III antiarrythmics (e. g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide)
- some antipsychotics (e. g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, trifluoperazine,
cyamemazine, sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol)
- others (e. g. bepridil, cisapride, diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin,
pentamidine, sparfloxacine, terfenadine, vincamine IV.)
Digitalis glycosides:
Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favours the onset of digitalis-induced arrhythmia (see section 4.4).
Other antihypertensive agents:
Telmisartan may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents.
Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulin):
Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal products may be required (see section 4.4).
5 Metformin:
Metformin should be used with precaution: risk of lactic acidosis induced by a possible functional renal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide.
Cholestyramine and colestipol resins:
Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products:
NSAIDs (i. e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti- inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics and the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
In some patients with compromised renal function (e. g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Therefore the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly.
Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter.
Pressor amines (e. g. noradrenaline):
The effect of pressor amines may be decreased.
Nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e. g. tubocurarine):
The effect of nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide.
Medicinal products used in the treatment for gout (e. g. probenecid, sulfinpyrazone and allopurinol):
Dosage adjustment of uricosuric medications may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid.
Increase in dosage of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary.
Co- administration of thiazide may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions of allopurinol.
Calcium salts:
Thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to the decreased excretion.
If calcium supplements must be prescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly.
Beta-blockers and diazoxide:
The hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides.
Anticholinergic agents (e. g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate.
Amantadine:
Thiazides may increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine.
Cytotoxic agents (e. g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate):
Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects.
Based on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan:
Baclofen, amifostine.
Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or antidepressants.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
6 Pregnancy (see section 4.3):
There are no adequate data from the use of MicardisPlus in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia).
(See also section 5.3).
Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood.
They may cause foetal electrolyte disturbances and possibly other reactions that have occurred in the adults.
Cases of neonatal thrombocytopenia, of foetal or neonatal jaundice have been reported with maternal thiazide therapy.
Lactation (see section 4.3):
MicardisPlus is contraindicated during lactation since it is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk.
Thiazides appear in human milk and may inhibit lactation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, when driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Fixed Dose Combination The overall incidence of adverse events reported with MicardisPlus was comparable to those reported with telmisartan alone in randomised controlled trials involving 1471 patients randomised to receive telmisartan plus hydrochlorothiazide (835) or telmisartan alone (636).
Dose-relationship of undesirable effects was not established and they showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients.
Adverse reactions reported in all clinical trials and occurring more frequently (p ≤ 0.05) with telmisartan plus hydrochlorothiazide than with placebo are shown below according to system organ class.
Adverse reactions known to occur with each component given singly but which have not been seen in clinical trials may occur during treatment with MicardisPlus.
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

4.9 Overdose
There is limited information available for telmisartan with regard to overdose in humans.
The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established.
10 Symptoms:
The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, vomiting, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported.
Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis.
The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence.
Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and/ or accentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products.
Treatment:
Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis.
The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.
Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms.
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/ or gastric lavage.
Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose.
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently.
If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, ATC code:
C09DA07
MicardisPlus is a combination of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide.
The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone.
MicardisPlus once daily produces effective and smooth reductions in blood pressure across the therapeutic dose range.
Telmisartan is an orally effective and specific angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1) antagonist.
Telmisartan displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II.
Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor.
Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor.
The binding is long-lasting.
Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors.
The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan.
Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan.
Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels.
Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin.
Therefore, it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin- mediated adverse effects.
An 80 mg dose of telmisartan administered to healthy volunteers almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure increase.
The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.
After the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours.
The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4-8 weeks after the start of treatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.
The antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements.
This is confirmed by measurements made at the point of maximum effect and immediately prior to the next dose (through to peak ratios consistently above 80% after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical studies).
In patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
Upon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.
11 The incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive treatments.
The effects of telmisartan on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown.
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic.
The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics is not fully known.
Thiazides have an effect on the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts.
The diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, and decreases in serum potassium.
Presumably through blockade of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, co-administration of telmisartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.
With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours.
Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term treatment with hydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.
The effects of Fixed Dose Combination of telmisartan/ HCTZ on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown.
5.2.
Pharmacokinetic properties
Concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and telmisartan does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of either substance in healthy subjects.
Absorption:
Telmisartan:
Following oral administration peak concentrations of telmisartan are reached in 0.5 – 1.5 h after dosing.
The absolute bioavailability of telmisartan at 40 mg and 160 mg was 42% and 58%, respectively.
Food slightly reduces the bioavailability of telmisartan with a reduction in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of about 6% with the 40 mg tablet and about 19% after a 160 mg dose.
By 3 hours after administration plasma concentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.
The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy.
The pharmacokinetics of orally administered telmisartan are non- linear over doses from 20 – 160 mg with greater than proportional increases of plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) with increasing doses.
Telmisartan does not accumulate significantly in plasma on repeated administration.
Hydrochlorothiazide:
Following oral administration of MicardisPlus peak concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide are reached in approximately 1.0 – 3.0 hours after dosing.
Based on cumulative renal excretion of hydrochlorothiazide the absolute bioavailability was about 60%.
Distribution:
Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99.5%) mainly albumin and alpha l- acid glycoprotein.
The apparent volume of distribution for telmisartan is approximately 500 litres indicating additional tissue binding.
Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% protein bound in the plasma and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83 – 1.14 l/ kg.
Biotransformation and elimination:
Telmisartan:
Following either intravenous or oral administration of 14 C-labelled telmisartan most of the administered dose (> 97%) was eliminated in faeces via biliary excretion.
Only minute amounts were found in urine.
Telmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to form a pharmacologically inactive acylglucuronide.
The glucuronide of the parent compound is the only metabolite that has been identified in humans.
After a single dose of 14C-labelled telmisartan the glucuronide represents approximately 11% of the measured radioactivity in plasma.
The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the metabolism of telmisartan.
Total plasma clearance of telmisartan after oral administration is > 1500 ml/ min.
Terminal elimination half-life was > 20 hours.
Hydrochlorothiazide:
Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolised in man and is excreted almost entirely as unchanged substance in urine.
About 60% of the oral dose is eliminated as unchanged substance
12 within 48 hours.
Renal clearance is about 250 – 300 ml/ min.
The terminal elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide is 10 – 15 hours.
Special populations
Elderly patients:
Pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years.
Gender:
Plasma concentrations of telmisartan are generally 2 – 3 times higher in females than in males.
In clinical trials however, no significant increases in blood pressure response or in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension were found in women.
No dosage adjustment is necessary.
There was a trend towards higher plasma concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide in female than in male subjects.
This is not considered to be of clinical relevance.
Patients with renal impairment:
Renal excretion does not contribute to the clearance of telmisartan.
Based on modest experience in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 – 60 ml/ min, mean about 50 ml/ min) no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with decreased renal function.
Telmisartan is not removed from blood by haemodialysis.
In patients with impaired renal function the rate of hydrochlorothiazide elimination is reduced.
In a typical study in patients with a mean creatinine clearance of 90 ml/ min the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was increased.
In functionally anephric patients the elimination half-life is about 34 hours.
Patients with hepatic impairment:
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability up to nearly 100%.
The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In preclinical safety studies performed with co-administration of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in normotensive rats and dogs, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused no additional findings not already observed with administration of either substance alone.
The toxicological findings observed appear to have no relevance to human therapeutic use.
Toxicological findings also well known from preclinical studies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists were: a reduction of red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes of renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), increased plasma renin activity, hypertrophy/ hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells and gastric mucosal injury.
Gastric lesions could be prevented/ ameliorated by oral saline supplementation and group housing of animals.
In dogs renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed.
These findings are considered to be due to the pharmacological activity of telmisartan.
Telmisartan showed no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.
Studies with hydrochlorothiazide have shown equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect in some experimental models.
However, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association between its use and an increase in neoplasms.
For the foetotoxic potential of the telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide combination see section 4.6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of essential hypertension.
MicardisPlus fixed dose combination (80 mg telmisartan/ 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on telmisartan alone.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults MicardisPlus should be taken once daily with liquid, with or without food in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by telmisartan alone.
Individual dose titration with each of the two components is recommended before changing to the fixed dose combination.
When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combination may be considered
• MicardisPlus 40 mg/ 12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by Micardis 40 mg • MicardisPlus 80 mg/ 12.5 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by Micardis 80 mg
Renal impairment:
Periodic monitoring of renal function is advised (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment:
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed MicardisPlus 40 mg/ 12.5 mg once daily.
MicardisPlus is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 4.4).
Elderly:
No dosage adjustment is necessary.
Children and adolescents:
MicardisPlus is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to any of the active substances or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1).
16 • Hypersensitivity to other sulphonamide-derived substances (since hydrochlorothiazide is a sulphonamide-derived medicinal product). • Second and third trimester of pregnancy and lactation (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). • Cholestasis and biliary obstructive disorders. • Severe hepatic impairment. • Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min). • Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Pregnancy Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).
Hepatic impairment:
MicardisPlus should not be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe hepatic insufficiency (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile.
These patients can be expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan.
In addition, MicardisPlus should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.
There is no clinical experience with MicardisPlus in patients with hepatic impairment.
Renovascular hypertension:
There is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation:
MicardisPlus should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min) (see section 4.3).
There is no experience regarding the administration of MicardisPlus in patients with recent kidney transplantation.
Experience with MicardisPlus is modest in the patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, therefore periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended.
Thiazide diuretic- associated azotaemia may occur in patients with impaired renal function.
Intravascular hypovolaemia:
Symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/ or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting.
Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of MicardisPlus.
Other conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system:
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Primary aldosteronism:
Patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.
Therefore, the use of MicardisPlus is not recommended.
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:
As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
17 Metabolic and endocrine effects:
Thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance.
In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents may be required.
Latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.
An increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels has been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; however, at the 12.5 mg dose contained in MicardisPlus, minimal or no effects were reported.
Hyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in some patients receiving thiazide therapy.
Electrolyte imbalance:
As for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals.
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, and hypochloraemic alkalosis).
Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are dryness of mouth, thirst, asthenia, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea or vomiting (see section 4.8).
- Hypokalaemia
Although hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with telmisartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia.
The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients with cirrhosis of liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see section 4.5).
- Hyperkalaemia
Conversely, due to the antagonism of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptors by the telmisartan component of MicardisPlus, hyperkalaemia might occur.
Although clinically significant hyperkalaemia has not been documented with MicardisPlus, risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include renal insufficiency and/ or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus.
Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with MicardisPlus (see section 4.5).
- Hyponatraemia and hypochloraemic alkalosis
There is no evidence that MicardisPlus would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia.
Chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment.
- Hypercalcaemia
Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism.
Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism.
Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.
- Hypomagnesaemia
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in hypomagnesaemia (see section 4.5).
Sorbitol and Lactose Monohydrate:
This medicinal product contains lactose monohydrate and sorbitol.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance and/ or with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
Ethnic differences:
As with all other angiotensin II receptor antagonists telmisartan is apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black patients than in non blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low renin states in the black hypertensive population.
18 Other:
As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.
General:
Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history.
Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide diuretics.
Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8).
If a photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment.
If a re- administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
Lithium:
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
Rare cases have also been reported with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including MicardisPlus).
Co- administration of lithium and MicardisPlus is not recommended (see section 4.4).
If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is recommended during concomitant use.
Medicinal products associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e. g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, corticosteroids, ACTH, amphotericin, carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium, salicylic acid and derivatives):
If these substances are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
These medicinal products may potentiate the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium (see section 4.4).
Medicinal products that may increase potassium levels or induce hyperkalaemia (e. g.
ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, cyclosporin or other medicinal products such as heparin sodium):
If these medicinal products are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
Based on the experience with the use of other medicinal products that blunt the renin- angiotensin system, concomitant use of the above medicinal products may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).
Medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances:
Periodic monitoring of serum potassium and ECG is recommended when MicardisPlus is administered with medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e. g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics) and the following torsades de pointes inducing medicinal products (which include some antiarrhythmics), hypokalaemia being a predisposing factor to torsades de pointes.
- class Ia antiarrythmics (e. g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide)
- class III antiarrythmics (e. g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide)
- some antipsychotics (e. g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, trifluoperazine,
cyamemazine, sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol)
- others (e. g. bepridil, cisapride, diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin,
pentamidine, sparfloxacine, terfenadine, vincamine IV.)
Digitalis glycosides:
Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favours the onset of digitalis-induced arrhythmia (see section 4.4).
Other antihypertensive agents:
Telmisartan may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents.
Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulin):
Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal products may be required (see section 4.4).
19 Metformin:
Metformin should be used with precaution: risk of lactic acidosis induced by a possible functional renal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide.
Cholestyramine and colestipol resins:
Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products:
NSAIDs (i. e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti- inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics and the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
In some patients with compromised renal function (eg dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Therefore the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly.
Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter.
Pressor amines (e. g. noradrenaline):
The effect of pressor amines may be decreased.
Nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e. g. tubocurarine):
The effect of nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide.
Medicinal products used in the treatment for gout (e. g. probenecid, sulfinpyrazone and allopurinol):
Dosage adjustment of uricosuric medications may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid.
Increase in dosage of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary.
Co- administration of thiazide may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions of allopurinol.
Calcium salts:
Thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to the decreased excretion.
If calcium supplements must be prescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly.
Beta-blockers and diazoxide:
The hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides.
Anticholinergic agents (e. g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate.
Amantadine:
Thiazides may increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine.
Cytotoxic agents (e. g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate):
Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects.
Based on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan:
Baclofen, amifostine.
Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or antidepressants.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
20 Pregnancy (see section 4.3):
There are no adequate data from the use of MicardisPlus in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia).
(See also section 5.3).
Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood.
They may cause foetal electrolyte disturbances and possibly other reactions that have occurred in the adults.
Cases of neonatal thrombocytopenia, of foetal or neonatal jaundice have been reported with maternal thiazide therapy.
Lactation (see section 4.3):
MicardisPlus is contraindicated during lactation since it is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk.
Thiazides appear in human milk and may inhibit lactation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, when driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Fixed Dose Combination The overall incidence of adverse events reported with MicardisPlus was comparable to those reported with telmisartan alone in randomised controlled trials involving 1471 patients randomised to receive telmisartan plus hydrochlorothiazide (835) or telmisartan alone (636).
Dose-relationship of undesirable effects was not established and they showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients.
Adverse reactions reported in all clinical trials and occurring more frequently (p ≤ 0.05) with telmisartan plus hydrochlorothiazide than with placebo are shown below according to system organ class.
Adverse reactions known to occur with each component given singly but which have not been seen in clinical trials may occur during treatment with MicardisPlus.
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

4.9 Overdose
24 There is limited information available for telmisartan with regard to overdose in humans.
The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established.
Symptoms:
The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia dizziness, vomiting, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported.
Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis.
The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence.
Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and/ or accentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products.
Treatment:
Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis.
The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.
Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms.
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/ or gastric lavage.
Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose.
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently.
If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, ATC code:
C09DA07
MicardisPlus is a combination of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide.
The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone.
MicardisPlus once daily produces effective and smooth reductions in blood pressure across the therapeutic dose range.
Telmisartan is an orally effective and specific angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1) antagonist.
Telmisartan displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II.
Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor.
Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor.
The binding is long-lasting.
Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors.
The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan.
Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan.
Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels.
Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin.
Therefore, it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin- mediated adverse effects.
An 80 mg dose of telmisartan administered to healthy volunteers almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure increase.
The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.
After the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours.
The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4-8 weeks after the start of treatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.
The antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements.
This is confirmed by measurements made at the point of maximum effect and immediately prior to the next dose (through to peak ratios consistently above 80% after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical studies).
In patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents
25 representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
Upon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.
The incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive treatments.
The effects of telmisartan on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown.
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic.
The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics is not fully known.
Thiazides have an effect on the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts.
The diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, and decreases in serum potassium.
Presumably through blockade of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, co-administration of telmisartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.
With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours.
Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term treatment with hydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.
The effects of Fixed Dose Combination of telmisartan/ HCTZ on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown.
5.2.
Pharmacokinetic properties
Concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and telmisartan does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of either substance in healthy subjects.
Absorption:
Telmisartan:
Following oral administration peak concentrations of telmisartan are reached in 0.5 – 1.5 h after dosing.
The absolute bioavailability of telmisartan at 40 mg and 160 mg was 42% and 58%, respectively.
Food slightly reduces the bioavailability of telmisartan with a reduction in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of about 6% with the 40 mg tablet and about 19% after a 160 mg dose.
By 3 hours after administration plasma concentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.
The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy.
The pharmacokinetics of orally administered telmisartan are non- linear over doses from 20 – 160 mg with greater than proportional increases of plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) with increasing doses.
Telmisartan does not accumulate significantly in plasma on repeated administration.
Hydrochlorothiazide:
Following oral administration of MicardisPlus peak concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide are reached in approximately 1.0 – 3.0 hours after dosing.
Based on cumulative renal excretion of hydrochlorothiazide the absolute bioavailability was about 60%.
Distribution:
Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99.5%) mainly albumin and alpha l- acid glycoprotein.
The apparent volume of distribution for telmisartan is approximately 500 litres indicating additional tissue binding.
Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% protein bound in the plasma and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83 – 1.14 1/ kg.
Biotransformation and elimination:
Telmisartan:
Following either intravenous or oral administration of 14 C-labelled telmisartan most of the administered dose (> 97%) was eliminated in faeces via biliary excretion.
Only minute amounts were found in urine.
Telmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to form a pharmacologically inactive acylglucuronide.
The glucuronide of the parent compound is the only metabolite that has been identified in humans.
After a single dose of 14C-labelled telmisartan the glucuronide represents approximately 11% of the measured radioactivity in plasma.
The cytochrome
26 P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the metabolism of telmisartan.
Total plasma clearance of telmisartan after oral administration is > 1500 ml/ min.
Terminal elimination half-life was > 20 hours.
Hydrochlorothiazide:
Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolised in man and is excreted almost entirely as unchanged substance in urine.
About 60% of the oral dose is eliminated as unchanged substance within 48 hours.
Renal clearance is about 250 – 300 ml/ min.
The terminal elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide is 10 – 15 hours.
Special populations
Elderly patients:
Pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years.
Gender:
Plasma concentrations of telmisartan are generally 2 – 3 times higher in females than in males.
In clinical trials however, no significant increases in blood pressure response or in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension were found in women.
No dosage adjustment is necessary.
There was a trend towards higher plasma concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide in female than in male subjects.
This is not considered to be of clinical relevance.
Patients with renal impairment:
Renal excretion does not contribute to the clearance of telmisartan.
Based on modest experience in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 – 60 ml/ min, mean about 50 ml/ min) no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with decreased renal function.
Telmisartan is not removed from blood by haemodialysis.
In patients with impaired renal function the rate of hydrochlorothiazide elimination is reduced.
In a typical study in patients with a mean creatinine clearance of 90 ml/ min the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was increased.
In functionally anephric patients the elimination half-life is about 34 hours.
Patients with hepatic impairment:
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability up to nearly 100%.
The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In preclinical safety studies performed with co-administration of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in normotensive rats and dogs, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused no additional findings not already observed with administration of either substance alone.
The toxicological findings observed appear to have no relevance to human therapeutic use.
Toxicological findings also well known from preclinical studies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists were: a reduction of red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes of renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), increased plasma renin activity, hypertrophy/ hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells and gastric mucosal injury.
Gastric lesions could be prevented/ ameliorated by oral saline supplementation and group housing of animals.
In dogs renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed.
These findings are considered to be due to the pharmacological activity of telmisartan.
Telmisartan showed no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.
Studies with hydrochlorothiazide have shown equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect in some experimental models.
However, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association between its use and an increase in neoplasms.
For the foetotoxic potential of the telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide combination see section 4.6.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of essential hypertension.
MicardisPlus fixed dose combination (80 mg telmisartan/ 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on MicardisPlus 80 mg/ 12.5 mg (80 mg telmisartan/ 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) or patients who have been previously stabilised on telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide given separately.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults MicardisPlus should be taken once daily with liquid, with or without food in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by telmisartan alone.
Individual dose titration with each of the two components is recommended before changing to the fixed dose combination.
When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed combination may be considered
MicardisPlus 80 mg/ 25 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by MicardisPlus 80 mg/ 12.5 mg or in patients who have been previously stabilised on telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide given separately.
MicardisPlus is also available at the dose strengths 40 mg/ 12.5 mg and 80 mg/ 12.5 mg
Renal impairment:
Periodic monitoring of renal function is advised (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment:
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed MicardisPlus 40 mg/ 12.5 mg once daily.
MicardisPlus is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function (see section 4.4).
Elderly:
No dosage adjustment is necessary.
Children and adolescents:
MicardisPlus is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
30 4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to any of the active substances or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). • Hypersensitivity to other sulphonamide-derived substances (since hydrochlorothiazide is a sulphonamide-derived medicinal product). • Second and third trimester of pregnancy and lactation (see section s 4.4 and 4.6). • Cholestasis and biliary obstructive disorders. • Severe hepatic impairment. • Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min). • Refractory hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Pregnancy Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).
Hepatic impairment:
MicardisPlus should not be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe hepatic insufficiency (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile.
These patients can be expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan.
In addition, MicardisPlus should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.
There is no clinical experience with MicardisPlus in patients with hepatic impairment.
Renovascular hypertension:
There is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation:
MicardisPlus should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min) (see section 4.3).
There is no experience regarding the administration of MicardisPlus in patients with recent kidney transplantation.
Experience with MicardisPlus is modest in the patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, therefore periodic monitoring of potassium, creatinine and uric acid serum levels is recommended.
Thiazide diuretic- associated azotaemia may occur in patients with impaired renal function.
Intravascular hypovolaemia:
Symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume and/ or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting.
Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of MicardisPlus.
Other conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system:
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Primary aldosteronism:
Patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.
Therefore, the use of MicardisPlus is not recommended.
31 Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:
As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Metabolic and endocrine effects:
Thiazide therapy may impair glucose tolerance.
In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents may be required.
Latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy.
An increase in cholesterol and triglyceride levels has been associated with thiazide diuretic therapy; however, at the 12.5 mg dose contained in MicardisPlus, minimal or no effects were reported.
Hyperuricaemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in some patients receiving thiazide therapy.
Electrolyte imbalance:
As for any patient receiving diuretic therapy, periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals.
Thiazides, including hydrochlorothiazide, can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance (including hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, and hypochloraemic alkalosis).
Warning signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance are dryness of mouth, thirst, asthenia, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea or vomiting (see section 4.8).
- Hypokalaemia
Although hypokalaemia may develop with the use of thiazide diuretics, concurrent therapy with telmisartan may reduce diuretic-induced hypokalaemia.
The risk of hypokalaemia is greater in patients with cirrhosis of liver, in patients experiencing brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (see section 4.5).
- Hyperkalaemia
Conversely, due to the antagonism of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptors by the telmisartan component of MicardisPlus, hyperkalaemia might occur.
Although clinically significant hyperkalaemia has not been documented with MicardisPlus, risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include renal insufficiency and/ or heart failure, and diabetes mellitus.
Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes should be co-administered cautiously with MicardisPlus (see section 4.5).
- Hyponatraemia and hypochloraemic alkalosis
There is no evidence that MicardisPlus would reduce or prevent diuretic-induced hyponatraemia.
Chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require treatment.
- Hypercalcaemia
Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion and cause an intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism.
Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism.
Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.
- Hypomagnesaemia
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in hypomagnesaemia (see section 4.5).
Sorbitol and Lactose Monohydrate:
This medicinal product contains lactose monohydrate and sorbitol.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance and/ or with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.
32 Ethnic differences:
As with all other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, telmisartan is apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black patients than in non blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low renin states in the black hypertensive population.
Other:
As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.
General:
Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history.
Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazide diuretics.
Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazide diuretics (see section 4.8).
If a photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment.
If a re- administration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
Lithium:
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
Rare cases have also been reported with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including MicardisPlus).
Co- administration of lithium and MicardisPlus is not recommended (see section 4.4).
If this combination proves essential, careful monitoring of serum lithium level is recommended during concomitant use.
Medicinal products associated with potassium loss and hypokalaemia (e. g. other kaliuretic diuretics, laxatives, corticosteroids, ACTH, amphotericin, carbenoxolone, penicillin G sodium, salicylic acid and derivatives):
If these substances are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
These medicinal products may potentiate the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium (see section 4.4).
Medicinal products that may increase potassium levels or induce hyperkalaemia (e. g.
ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, cyclosporin or other medicinal products such as heparin sodium):
If these medicinal products are to be prescribed with the hydrochlorothiazide-telmisartan combination, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
Based on the experience with the use of other medicinal products that blunt the renin- angiotensin system, concomitant use of the above medicinal products may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).
Medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances:
Periodic monitoring of serum potassium and ECG is recommended when MicardisPlus is administered with medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e. g. digitalis glycosides, antiarrhythmics) and the following torsades de pointes inducing medicinal products (which include some antiarrhythmics), hypokalaemia being a predisposing factor to torsades de pointes.
- class Ia antiarrythmics (e. g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide)
- class III antiarrythmics (e. g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide)
- some antipsychotics (e. g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, levomepromazine, trifluoperazine,
cyamemazine, sulpiride, sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol)
- others (e. g. bepridil, cisapride, diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin,
pentamidine, sparfloxacine, terfenadine, vincamine IV.)
Digitalis glycosides:
Thiazide-induced hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia favours the onset of digitalis-induced arrhythmia (see section 4.4).
33 Other antihypertensive agents:
Telmisartan may increase the hypotensive effect of other antihypertensive agents.
Antidiabetic medicinal products (oral agents and insulin):
Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic medicinal products may be required (see section 4.4).
Metformin:
Metformin should be used with precaution: risk of lactic acidosis induced by a possible functional renal failure linked to hydrochlorothiazide.
Cholestyramine and colestipol resins:
Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products:
NSAIDs (i. e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti- inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs) may reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics and the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
In some patients with compromised renal function (e. g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function) the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Therefore the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly.
Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter.
Pressor amines (e. g. noradrenaline):
The effect of pressor amines may be decreased.
Nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants (e. g. tubocurarine):
The effect of nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants may be potentiated by hydrochlorothiazide.
Medicinal products used in the treatment for gout (e. g. probenecid, sulfinpyrazone and allopurinol):
Dosage adjustment of uricosuric medications may be necessary as hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of serum uric acid.
Increase in dosage of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary.
Co- administration of thiazide may increase the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions of allopurinol.
Calcium salts:
Thiazide diuretics may increase serum calcium levels due to the decreased excretion.
If calcium supplements must be prescribed, serum calcium levels should be monitored and calcium dosage adjusted accordingly.
Beta-blockers and diazoxide:
The hyperglycaemic effect of beta-blockers and diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides.
Anticholinergic agents (e. g. atropine, biperiden) may increase the bioavailability of thiazide-type diuretics by decreasing gastrointestinal motility and stomach emptying rate.
Amantadine:
Thiazides may increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine.
Cytotoxic agents (e. g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate):
Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects.
Based on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal product may potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan:
Baclofen, amifostine.
Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or antidepressants.
34 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Pregnancy (see section 4.3):
There are no adequate data from the use of MicardisPlus in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia).
(See also section 5.3).
Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood.
They may cause foetal electrolyte disturbances and possibly other reactions that have occurred in the adults.
Cases of neonatal thrombocytopenia, of foetal or neonatal jaundice have been reported with maternal thiazide therapy.
Lactation (see section 4.3):
MicardisPlus is contraindicated during lactation since it is not known whether telmisartan is excreted in human milk.
Thiazides appear in human milk and may inhibit lactation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, when driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Fixed Dose Combination The overall incidence and pattern of adverse events reported with MicardisPlus 80 mg/ 25 mg was comparable with MicardisPlus 80 mg/ 12.5 mg.
A dose-relationship of undesirable effects was not established and they showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients.
Adverse reactions reported in all clinical trials and occurring more frequently (p ≤ 0.05) with telmisartan plus hydrochlorothiazide than with placebo are shown below according to system organ class.
Adverse reactions known to occur with each component given singly but which have not been seen in clinical trials may occur during treatment with MicardisPlus.
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

4.9 Overdose
38 There is limited information available for telmisartan with regard to overdose in humans.
The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established.
Symptoms:
The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose werehypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, vomiting, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported.
Overdose with hydrochlorothiazide is associated with electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia) and hypovolaemia resulting from excessive diuresis.
The most common signs and symptoms of overdose are nausea and somnolence.
Hypokalaemia may result in muscle spasms and/ or accentuate arrhythmia associated with the concomitant use of digitalis glycosides or certain anti-arrhythmic medicinal products.
Treatment:
Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis.
The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.
Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms.
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/ or gastric lavage.
Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose.
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently.
If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacements given quickly.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists and diuretics, ATC code:
C09DA07
MicardisPlus is a combination of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, telmisartan, and a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide.
The combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone.
MicardisPlus once daily produces effective and smooth reductions in blood pressure across the therapeutic dose range.
Telmisartan is an orally effective and specific angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1) antagonist.
Telmisartan displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II.
Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor.
Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor.
The binding is long-lasting.
Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors.
The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan.
Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan.
Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels.
Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin.
Therefore, it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin- mediated adverse effects.
An 80 mg dose of telmisartan administered to healthy volunteers almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure increase.
The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.
After the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours.
The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4-8 weeks after the start of treatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.
The antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements.
This is confirmed by measurements made at the point of maximum effect and immediately prior to the next dose (through to peak ratios consistently above 80% after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical studies).
In patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
39 In a double-blind controlled clinical trial (n=687 patients evaluated for efficacy) in non-responders to the 80 mg/ 12.5 mg combination, an incremental blood pressure lowering effect of the 80 mg/ 25 mg combination compared to continued treatment with the 80 mg/ 12.5 mg combination of 2.7/ 1.6 mm Hg (SBP/ DBP) was demonstrated (difference in adjusted mean changes from baseline).
In a follow-up trial with the 80 mg/ 25 mg combination, blood pressure was further decreased (resulting in an overall reduction of 11.5/ 9.9 mm Hg (SBP/ DBP).
In a pooled analysis of two similar 8 week double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials vs. valsartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 160 mg/ 25 mg (n=2121 patients evaluated for efficacy) a significantly greater blood pressure lowering effect of 2.2/ 1.2 mm Hg (SBP/ DBP) was demonstrated (difference in adjusted mean changes from baseline, respectively) in favour of telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/ 25 mg combination.
Upon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.
The incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive treatments.
The effects of telmisartan on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown.
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic.
The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics is not fully known.
Thiazides have an effect on the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts.
The diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, with consequent increases in urinary potassium and bicarbonate loss, and decreases in serum potassium.
Presumably through blockade of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, co-administration of telmisartan tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.
With hydrochlorothiazide, onset of diuresis occurs in 2 hours, and peak effect occurs at about 4 hours, while the action persists for approximately 6-12 hours.
Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term treatment with hydrochlorothiazide reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.
The effects of Fixed Dose Combination of telmisartan/ HCTZ on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown.
5.2.
Pharmacokinetic properties
Concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide and telmisartan does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of either substance in healthy subjects.
Absorption:
Telmisartan:
Following oral administration peak concentrations of telmisartan are reached in 0.5 – 1.5 h after dosing.
The absolute bioavailability of telmisartan at 40 mg and 160 mg was 42% and 58%, respectively.
Food slightly reduces the bioavailability of telmisartan with a reduction in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of about 6% with the 40 mg tablet and about 19% after a 160 mg dose.
By 3 hours after administration plasma concentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.
The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy.
The pharmacokinetics of orally administered telmisartan are non- linear over doses from 20 – 160 mg with greater than proportional increases of plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) with increasing doses.
Telmisartan does not accumulate significantly in plasma on repeated administration.
Hydrochlorothiazide:
Following oral administration of MicardisPlus peak concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide are reached in approximately 1.0 – 3.0 hours after dosing.
Based on cumulative renal excretion of hydrochlorothiazide the absolute bioavailability was about 60%.
40 Distribution:
Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99.5%) mainly albumin and alpha l- acid glycoprotein.
The apparent volume of distribution for telmisartan is approximately 500 litres indicating additional tissue binding.
Hydrochlorothiazide is 68% protein bound in the plasma and its apparent volume of distribution is 0.83 – 1.14 1/ kg.
Biotransformation and elimination:
Telmisartan:
Following either intravenous or oral administration of 14 C-labelled telmisartan most of the administered dose (> 97%) was eliminated in faeces via biliary excretion.
Only minute amounts were found in urine.
Telmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to form a pharmacologically inactive acylglucuronide.
The glucuronide of the parent compound is the only metabolite that has been identified in humans.
After a single dose of 14C-labelled telmisartan the glucuronide represents approximately 11% of the measured radioactivity in plasma.
The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the metabolism of telmisartan.
Total plasma clearance of telmisartan after oral administration is > 1500 ml/ min.
Terminal elimination half-life was > 20 hours.
Hydrochlorothiazide:
Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolised in man and is excreted almost entirely as unchanged substance in urine.
About 60% of the oral dose is eliminated as unchanged substance within 48 hours.
Renal clearance is about 250 – 300 ml/ min.
The terminal elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide is 10 – 15 hours.
Special populations
Elderly patients:
Pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years.
Gender:
Plasma concentrations of telmisartan are generally 2 – 3 times higher in females than in males.
In clinical trials however, no significant increases in blood pressure response or in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension were found in women.
No dosage adjustment is necessary.
There was a trend towards higher plasma concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide in female than in male subjects.
This is not considered to be of clinical relevance.
Patients with renal impairment:
Renal excretion does not contribute to the clearance of telmisartan.
Based on modest experience in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 – 60 ml/ min, mean about 50 ml/ min) no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with decreased renal function.
Telmisartan is not removed from blood by haemodialysis.
In patients with impaired renal function the rate of hydrochlorothiazide elimination is reduced.
In a typical study in patients with a mean creatinine clearance of 90 ml/ min the elimination half-life of hydrochlorothiazide was increased.
In functionally anephric patients the elimination half-life is about 34 hours.
Patients with hepatic impairment:
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability up to nearly 100%.
The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
No additional preclinical studies have been performed with the Fixed Dose Combination product 80 mg/ 25 mg.
Previous preclinical safety studies performed with co-administration of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in normotensive rats and dogs, in doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range, caused no additional findings not already observed with administration of either substance alone.
The toxicological findings observed appear to have no relevance to human therapeutic use.
Toxicological findings also well known from preclinical studies with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists were: a reduction of red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes of renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), increased plasma renin activity, hypertrophy/ hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells and gastric mucosal injury.
Gastric lesions could be prevented/ ameliorated by
41 oral saline supplementation and group housing of animals.
In dogs renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed.
These findings are considered to be due to the pharmacological activity of telmisartan.
Telmisartan showed no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.
Studies with hydrochlorothiazide have shown equivocal evidence for a genotoxic or carcinogenic effect in some experimental models.
However, the extensive human experience with hydrochlorothiazide has failed to show an association between its use and an increase in neoplasms.
For the foetotoxic potential of the telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide combination see section 4.6.

Further information
1.
WHAT MICARDISPLUS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
MicardisPlus is a combination of two active substances, telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in one tablet.
Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure.
- Telmisartan belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow thus increasing your blood pressure.
Telmisartan blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered.
- Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics, which cause
your urine output to increase, leading to a lowering of your blood pressure.
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead sometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness.
There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs.
Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range.
MicardisPlus is used to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough when either telmisartan or hydrochlorothiazide is used alone.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE MICARDISPLUS
Do not take MicardisPlus
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to telmisartan or any other ingredients included in MicardisPlus tablets (see "Further information" for a list of other ingredients). • if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to hydrochlorothiazide or to any other sulfonamide-derived medicines. • during the last six months of pregnancy (see section Pregnancy and breast-feeding) • if you are breast-feeding. • if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from the gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.
61 • if you have severe kidney disease. • if your doctor determines that you have low potassium levels or high calcium levels in your blood that do not get better with treatment.
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking MicardisPlus.
Take special care with MicardisPlus
Please tell your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or illnesses:
- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body
water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (water tablets), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, vomiting, or haemodialysis.
- Kidney disease or kidney transplant.
- Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys).
- Liver disease.
- Heart trouble.
- Diabetes.
- Gout.
- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various blood
minerals).
- Lupus erythematosus (also called “ lupus” or “ SLE”) a disease where the body’ s immune system
attacks the body.
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
MicardisPlus is not recommended in early pregnancy and may cause serious harm to your baby after 3 months of pregnancy (see section Pregnancy and breast-feeding).
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide may cause electrolyte imbalance in your body.
Typical symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance include dry mouth, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tired muscles, and an abnormally fast heart rate (faster than 100 beats per minute).
If you experience any of these you should tell your doctor.
You should also tell your doctor, if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal.
In case of surgery or anaesthetics, you should tell your doctor that you are taking MicardisPlus.
The use of MicardisPlus in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.
As with all other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, telmisartan may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.
Taking other medicines:
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medications or take other precautions.
In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines.
This applies especially to the medicines listed below taken at the same time with MicardisPlus:
- Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression.
- Medicines associated with low blood potassium (hypokalaemia) such as other diuretics, ('water
tablets'), laxatives (e. g. castor oil), corticosteroids (e. g. prednisone), ACTH (a hormone),
62 amphotericin (an antifungal medicine), carbenoxolone (used to treat mouth ulcers), penicillin G sodium (an antibiotic), and salicylic acid and derivatives.
- Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium,
ACE inhibitors that may increase blood potassium levels.
- Heart medicines (e. g. digoxin) or medicines to control the rhythm of your heart (e. g. quinidine,
disopyramide).
- Medicines used for mental disorders (e. g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, levomepromazine).
- Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, steroids, painkillers, medicines to treat
cancer, gout, or arthritis, and vitamin D supplements.
MicardisPlus may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines and you should consult with your doctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking MicardisPlus.
As with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of MicardisPlus may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e. g. aspirin or ibuprofen).
Taking MicardisPlus with food and drink
You can take MicardisPlus with or without food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
Usually, your doctor will advise you to take another medicine instead of MicardisPlus, as MicardisPlus is not recommended in early pregnancy, and may cause serious harm to your baby if it is used after 3 months of pregnancy.
Appropriate antihypertensive drug must usually replace MicardisPlus before starting a pregnancy.
MicardisPlus should not be used during the second and third trimester of pregnancy.
Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking MicardisPlus as soon as you know you are pregnant.
If you become pregnant during therapy with MicardisPlus, please inform and see your doctor without delay.
You must not take MicardisPlus if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
No information is available on the effect of MicardisPlus on the ability to drive or operate machinery.
Some people feel dizzy or tired when they are treated for high blood pressure.
If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or operate machinery.
Important information about some of the ingredients of MicardisPlus
MicardisPlus contains milk sugar (lactose) and sorbitol.
If you are intolerant to some sugars, consult your doctor before taking MicardisPlus.
3.
HOW TO TAKE MICARDISPLUS
Always take MicardisPlus exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
The usual dose of MicardisPlus is one tablet a day.
Try to take a tablet at the same time each day.
You can take MicardisPlus with or without food.

Further information
1.
WHAT MICARDISPLUS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
MicardisPlus is a combination of two active substances, telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in one tablet.
Both substances help to control high blood pressure.
- Telmisartan belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus increasing your blood pressure.
Telmisartan blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered.
- Hydrochlorothiazide belongs to a group of medicines called thiazide diuretics, which cause
your urine output to increase leading to a lowering of your blood pressure.
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead sometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness.
There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs., Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range.
MicardisPlus is used to treat high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough when either telmisartan or hydrochlorothiazide is used alone.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE MICARDISPLUS
Do not take MicardisPlus
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to telmisartan or any other ingredients included in MicardisPlus tablets (see "Further Information" for a list of other ingredients). • if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to hydrochlorothiazide or to any other sulfonamide-derived medicines. • during the last six months of pregnancy (see section Pregnancy and breast-feeding) • if you are breast-feeding. • if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from the gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.
69 • if you have severe kidney disease. • if your doctor determines that you have low potassium levels or high calcium levels in your blood that do not get better with treatment.
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking MicardisPlus.
Take special care with MicardisPlus
Please tell your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or illnesses:
- Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body
water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy (water tablets), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, vomiting, or haemodialysis.
- Kidney disease or kidney transplant.
- Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys).
- Liver disease.
- Heart trouble.
- Diabetes.
- Gout.
- Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various blood
minerals).
- Lupus erythematosus (also called “ lupus” or “ SLE”) a disease where the body’ s immune system
attacks the body.
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
MicardisPlus is not recommended in early pregnancy and may cause serious harm to your baby after 3 months of pregnancy (see section Pregnancy and breast-feeding).
Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide may cause electrolyte imbalance in your body.
Typical symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance include dry mouth, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, tired muscles, and an abnormally fast heart rate (faster than 100 beats per minute).
If you experience any of these you should tell your doctor.
You should also tell your doctor, if you experience an increased sensitivity of the skin to the sun with symptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) occurring more quickly than normal.
In case of surgery or anaesthetics, you should tell your doctor that you are taking MicardisPlus.
The use of MicardisPlus in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.
As with all other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, telmisartan may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.
Taking other medicines:
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medications or take other precautions.
In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines.
This applies especially to the medicines listed below taken at the same time with MicardisPlus:
- Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression.
- Medicines associated with low blood potassium (hypokalaemia) such as other diuretics, ('water
tablets'), laxatives (e. g. castor oil), corticosteroids (e. g. prednisone), ACTH (a hormone),
70 amphotericin (an antifungal medicine), carbenoxolone (used to treat mouth ulcers), penicillin G sodium (an antibiotic), and salicylic acid and derivatives.
- Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium,
ACE inhibitors that may increase blood potassium levels.
- Heart medicines (e. g. digoxin) or medicines to control the rhythm of your heart (e. g. quinidine,
disopyramide).
- Medicines used for mental disorders (e. g. thioridazine, chlorpromazine, levomepromazine).
- Other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, steroids, painkillers, medicines to treat
cancer, gout, or arthritis, and vitamin D supplements.
MicardisPlus may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines and you should consult with your doctor if you need to adjust the dose of your other medicine while taking MicardisPlus.
As with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of MicardisPlus may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e. g. aspirin or ibuprofen).
Taking MicardisPlus with food and drink
You can take MicardisPlus tablets with or without food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
Usually, your doctor will advise you to take another medicine instead of MicardisPlus, as MicardisPlus is not recommended in early pregnancy, and may cause serious harm to your baby if it is used after 3 months of pregnancy.
Appropriate antihypertensive drug must usually replace MicardisPlus before starting a pregnancy.
MicardisPlus should not be used during the second and third trimester of pregnancy.
Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking MicardisPlus as soon as you know you are pregnant.
If you become pregnant during therapy with MicardisPlus, please inform and see your doctor without delay.
You must not take MicardisPlus if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
No information is available on the effect of MicardisPlus on the ability to drive or operate machinery.
Some people feel dizzy or tired when they are treated for high blood pressure.
If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or operate machinery.
Important information about some of the ingredients of MicardisPlus

If you are intolerant to some sugars, consult your doctor before taking MicardisPlus.
