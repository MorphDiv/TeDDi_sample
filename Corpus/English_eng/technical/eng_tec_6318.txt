Creating a custom theme
When the module is opened, it will show items from the current desktop theme. If you would like to start customizing with a different theme, select it from the drop box above the list of theme items. This theme from the drop box is the starting theme, the base for your new customized desktop theme.
In the list of items, for each item you would like to replace, select replacement item from the drop list for that item. You may select the corresponding item from another theme, or you may select a file. Plasma desktop theme items are svg files, except for the color scheme which is a KDE color scheme file.
Click Apply when all the changes have been made. This will create a new theme named (Customized) which you can select from the Appearance Settings dialog on the desktop.
The theme items listed are the most visible components of the plasma desktop theme. Other theme components are not listed. Your newly created theme will use these unlisted components from the theme that you selected at the start of creating the customized theme.
