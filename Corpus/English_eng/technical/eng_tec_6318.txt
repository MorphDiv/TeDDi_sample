Total Memory
This graph gives you an overview of the total sum of physical and virtual memory in your system.
Physical Memory
This graph gives you an overview of the usage of physical memory in your system. Most operating systems (including Linux) will use as much of the available physical memory as possible as disk cache, to speed up the system performance. This means that if you have a small amount of Free Physical Memory and a large amount of Disk Cache Memory, your system is well configured.
Swap Space
The swap space is the virtual memory available to the system. It will be used on demand and is provided through one or more swap partitions and/ or swap files.
