Installation
Dependencies
MPlayer
& kplayer; uses mplayer; as the multimedia backend for playing audio and video files and streams. This ensures maximum variety of supported types of files and encodings.
You need to have & mplayer; version 1.0-pre8 or later. If there are good binary packages for your distribution, use those. For example on Debian you would do
echo'deb http: / /debian-multimedia. org unstable main '> > / etc/ apt/ sources. list
apt-get update
apt-get install mplayer
Substitute unstable for stable or testing as required. The same repository also has a & kplayer; package, so you can install it as well:
apt-get install kplayer
As always compiling from source is an option.
X11 and XVideo
X11 is required. The X Server and libraries released by X. org are recommended. XFree86 may also work.
XVideo extension is recommended. You can check your / etc/ X11/ xorg. conf or / etc/ X11/ XF86Config-4 file for a line that reads
Load "extmod"
This is the line that loads XVideo extension, so make sure it is not disabled. Also check / var/ log/ Xorg.0. log or / var/ log/ XFree86.0. log to make sure that XVideo is loaded without error.
See the Configuration micro-HOWTO if you want to use a different video output.
Qt and KDE
& kplayer; 0.6 supports & kde; 3.1 and later, so you need to either run a relatively recent & kde; (recommended) or at least have & kde; libraries and the corresponding Qt libraries on your system.
Binary install
The recommended way to install & kplayer; is by using the binary package built specifically for your distribution. The Downloads section of the & kplayer; home page lists the available packages and repositories.
Compiling from source
If you cannot install a precompiled binary for any reason, you can compile & kplayer; yourself. See the Compilation Micro-HOWTO for instructions.
Compiling from CVS
If you want to try the latest and greatest & kplayer; features at the risk of getting some parts of it broken, you can compile the latest CVS code. See the Compilation Micro-HOWTO for details.
X11 is required. Recommended versions are XFree86 4.2. x and 4.3. x, as well as X Server versions released by X. org.
