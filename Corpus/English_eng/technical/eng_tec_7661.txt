_Import format
_Automatically import audio CDs when inserted
When an audio CD is inserted, automatically begin importing it if metadata can be found and it is not already in the library.
_Eject when done importing
When an audio CD has been imported, automatically eject it.
Use error correction when importing
Error correction tries to work around problem areas on a disc, such as surface scratches, but will slow down importing substantially.
