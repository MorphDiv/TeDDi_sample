Introduction
Game type: Strategy, Board
& kfourinline; is a board game for two players based on the Connect-Four game.
The players try to build up a row of four pieces using different strategies. Pieces are placed on a board. The game can also be played against a computer.
How to Play
When & kfourinline; loads, you can select the difficulty or start a two player game. If you like, you can also pick your color and select which color starts the game.
Each player is represented by a color (for example yellow or white for player one and red for player two). The goal of the game is to get four connected pieces of your color into any row, column or diagonal. The players move in turns. Each turn the player can place one of his or her pieces into any of the seven columns where each piece will fall to the lowest possible free place & ie; it will fall down until it reaches the ground level or another piece.
After one player's move is done the second player can make his or her input. This is repeated until the game is over, which is when one of the players has four pieces in a row, column or diagonal or no more moves are possible because the board is filled.
A player who first manages to get four pieces in a row, column or diagonal wins the game. If no more moves can be made but no player has won, the game ends drawn.
Game rules, strategies and tips
The board is separated into several regions.
The game board is constructed out of 7x6 fields which will be filled from bottom to top. The fields are marked with pieces in the color of the player who made the move to this position. On top of each column a colored arrow shows were the last piece had been put.
The status display shows which player is controlled by which input device. A local player can input moves using keyboard or mouse, a remote player is shown as network input and finally the computer can control the input for a player. The status display further shows the player's names and the level of the computer opponent. Additionally the number of won, drawn, lost and ended games is noted for both players. Which player is next to move is indicated by one of the player's names being highlighted.
The statusbar at the bottom of the screen displays the status of the game and which player is next to play.
Remote Connections
It is possible to play the game over a network connection with another computer. One of the computers will act as game server. This one can determine who should play which color. You can configure the network options in the menu Settings Network Configuration.... In the menu Game Network Chat.... you find a chat dialog box which allows you to speak with your friend.
When a network connection is build you are asked to enter a remote host and a port. The port can usually just be left untouched, but if you know what you are doing replace it by another number, which has to be the same in both player games of course. The hostname should be the name of the remote host to which you are connecting. Only the client in the connection has to supply a hostname. It is often wise that the player behind a firewall chooses to be client as the firewall might not allow incoming connections.

Four wins is a game for two players.
A piece will begin to fill a column from the bottom, & ie; it will fall down until it reaches the ground level or another stone. After a move is done it is the turn of the other player.
The status display shows which player color starts and which color is played by whom (player, computer, remote connection). It further shows the level of the computer opponent, the number of moves done as well as the computer calculated chance of winning. This chance is calculated only if the computer opponent makes a move. A positive number means that the player has an advantage, a negative number means that the computer thinks he is better.
The table display shows the number of won, lost and drawn games is noted for both player. Also the number of aborted games (Brk) and the sum of games is shown.
