The & infocenter; (from now on referred to simply as the information center) provides you with a centralized and convenient overview of your & kde; and system settings.
The information center is made up of multiple modules. Each module is a separate application, but the information center organizes all of these programs into a convenient location.
Using The & infocenter;
This next section details the use of the information center itself. For information on individual modules, please see Info Center Modules
Starting the & infocenter;
The & infocenter; can be started 3 ways:
By selecting K Button System Info Center from the & kde; Panel.
By pressing Alt; F2.
This will bring up a dialog box. Type kinfocenter, and click Run or press & Enter;.
You can type kinfocenter & at any command prompt.
All three of these methods are equivalent, and produce the same result.
The & infocenter; Screen
When you start the information center, you are presented with a window, which can be divided into 3 functional parts.
Across the top is a menubar. The menubar will provide you with quick access to most of & infocenter; 's features. The menus are detailed in The & kde; Info Center Menus.
