Unable to contact the KDE smartcard service.
Possible Reasons
1) The KDE daemon, 'kded 'is not running. You can restart it by running the command'kdeinit' and then try reloading the KDE System Settings to see if this message goes away. 2) You do not appear to have smartcard support in the KDE libraries. You will need to recompile the kdelibs package with libpcsclite installed.
Smartcard Support
& Enable smartcard support
Enable & polling to autodetect card events
In most cases you should have this enabled. It allows KDE to automatically detect card insertion and reader hotplug events.
Automatically & launch card manager if inserted card is unclaimed
When you insert a smartcard, KDE can automatically launch a management tool if no other application attempts to use the card.
