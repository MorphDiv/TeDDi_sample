Quickguide: Burning an Audio-CD in 4 Steps
This Quickguide shows you how to create a AudioCD with & k3b;. To reproduce these steps you need a working & k3b; and a directory in which you have audiofiles.
Step 1
When you start & k3b; you should see something like this.
Here you can select one of four projects & k3b; offers
Screenshot
Step 2
Now you click on "New Audio CD Project"
This is a dialog where you can select which files you want to burn on a CD
The files you see on the top-part of & k3b; can be dropped with the mouse to the bottom-widget. Another way is to right-click on a file an select Add to Project. In order to rearrange the order of the audio-tracks you can simply move the tracks with the left mouse-button. The properties of the tracks can be changed by clicking with the & RMB; and choosing Properties. As soon as you like the arrangement of the tracks click on Burn... in the right-bottom corner.
When you burn AudioCD from MP3 s or other lossy compressed music, remember that if you encode this CD back to MP3, you'll get poorer quality regardless the bitrate you use. To check whether AudioCD was burnt from lossy format, try auCDtect.
Step 3
This is a dialog where you can decide the settings for the CD.
In this dialog you can control the settings of the burning itself. The default-settings of & k3b; are probably correct for you. In the top-right corner you can control the speed. One last step before the actual burning you can give the CD a title by choosing CD-Text and selecting Write CD-Text. The two which are probably most important for you are Title and Performer. As soon as you are content with the settings click on Burn.
Step 4
In this dialog you can see the progress of you burning
In this dialog is nothing you can do. Just wait for you computer to finish the session.
