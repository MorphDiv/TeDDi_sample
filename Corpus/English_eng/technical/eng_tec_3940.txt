(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a MySQL link identifier on success, or FALSE on failure.
mysql_connect() establishes a connection to a MySQL server.
The following defaults are assumed for missing optional parameters: server = 'localhost:3306', username = name of the user that owns the server process and password = empty password.
The server parameter can also include a port number. eg. "hostname:port" or a path to a socket eg. ": / path / to / socket" for the localhost.
Note:
Support for ":port" was added in PHP 3.0B4.
Support for ": / path / to / socket" was added in PHP 3.0.10.
You can suppress the error message on failure by prepending a @ to the function name.
If a second call is made to mysql_connect() with the same arguments, no new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already opened link will be returned.
The new_link parameter modifies this behavior and makes mysql_connect() always open a new link, even if mysql_connect() was called before with the same parameters.
The client_flags parameter can be a combination of the constants MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL, MYSQL_CLIENT_COMPRESS, MYSQL_CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE or MYSQL_CLIENT_INTERACTIVE.
Note:
The new_link parameter became available in PHP 4.2.0
The client_flags parameter became available in PHP 4.3.0
The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script ends, unless it' s closed earlier by explicitly calling mysql_close().
Example 1.
MySQL connect example
?php $link = mysql_connect( "localhost", "mysql_user", "mysql_password") or die("Could not connect: ". mysql_error()); print ("Connected successfully"); mysql_close($link);?
See also mysql_pconnect() and mysql_close().
