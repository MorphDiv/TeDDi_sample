Enable background
If this is checked, KDM will use the settings below for the background. If it is disabled, you have to look after the background yourself. This is done by running some program (possibly xsetroot) in the script specified in the Setup= option in kdmrc (usually Xsetup).
Attention Read help
Enable Auto-Login
Turn on the auto-login feature. This applies only to KDM's graphical login. Think twice before enabling this!
User:
Select the user to be logged in automatically.
Lock session
The automatically started session will be locked immediately (provided it is a KDE session). This can be used to obtain a super-fast login restricted to one user.
Preselect User
& None
Previous
Preselect the user that logged in previously. Use this if this computer is usually used several consecutive times by one user.
Specified:
Preselect the user specified in the combo box to the right. Use this if this computer is predominantly used by a certain user.
Select the user to be preselected for login. This box is editable, so you can specify an arbitrary non-existent user to mislead possible attackers.
Focus password
When this option is on, KDM will place the cursor in the password field instead of the user field after preselecting a user. Use this to save one key press per login, if the preselection usually does not need to be changed.
Enable Password-Less Logins
When this option is checked, the checked users from the list below will be allowed to log in without entering their password. This applies only to KDM's graphical login. Think twice before enabling this!
No password required for:
Check all users you want to allow a password-less login for. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Miscellaneous
Automatically log in again after & X server crash
When this option is on, a user will be logged in again automatically when their session is interrupted by an X server crash; note that this can open a security hole: if you use a screen locker than KDE's integrated one, this will make circumventing a password-secured screen lock possible.
& Greeting:
This is the "headline" for KDM's login window. You may want to put some nice greeting or information about the operating system here. KDM will substitute the following character pairs with the respective contents: %d - > current display %h - > host name, possibly with domain name %n - > node name, most probably the host name without domain name %s - > the operating system %r - > the operating system's version %m - > the machine (hardware) type%% - > a single%

Here you can select who is allowed to shutdown the computer using KDM. You can specify different values for local (console) and remote displays. Possible values are: Everybody: everybody can shutdown the computer using KDM Only root: KDM will only allow shutdown after the user has entered the root password Nobody: nobody can shutdown the computer using KDM

Show list
If this option is checked, KDM will show a list of users, so users can click on their name or image rather than typing in their login.
Autocompletion
If this option is checked, KDM will automatically complete user names while they are typed in the line edit.
Inverse selection
This option specifies how the users for "Show list" and "Autocompletion" are selected in the "Select users and groups" list: If not checked, select only the checked users. If checked, select all non-system users, except the checked ones.
Sort users
If this is checked, KDM will alphabetically sort the user list. Otherwise users are listed in the order they appear in the password file.
Select users and groups:
Selected Users
KDM will show all checked users. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Excluded Users
KDM will show all non-checked non-system users. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
User Image Source
Here you can specify where KDM will obtain the images that represent users. "System" represents the global folder; these are the pictures you can set below. "User" means that KDM should read the user's $HOME/. face. icon file. The two selections in the middle define the order of preference if both sources are available.

KDE Login Manager Config Module

Login Manager In this module you can configure the various aspects of the KDE Login Manager. This includes the look and feel as well as the users that can be selected for login. Note that you can only make changes if you run the module with superuser rights. If you have not started the KDE System Settings with superuser rights (which is absolutely the right thing to do, by the way), click on the Modify button to acquire superuser rights. You will be asked for the superuser password. General On this tab page, you can configure parts of the Login Manager's look, and which language it should use. The language settings made here have no influence on the user's language settings. Dialog Here you can configure the look of the "classical" dialog based mode if you have chosen to use it. Background If you want to set a special background for the dialog based login screen, this is where to do it. Themes Here you can specify a theme to be used by the Login Manager. Shutdown Here you can specify who is allowed to shutdown/ reboot the machine and whether a boot manager should be used. Users On this tab page, you can select which users the Login Manager will offer you for logging in. Convenience Here you can specify a user to be logged in automatically, users not needing to provide a password to log in, and other convenience features. Note, that these settings are security holes by their nature, so use them very carefully.
& General
& Dialog
There is no login dialog window in themed mode.
& Background
