Workarounds
Disable bootloader _graphics
The grub bootloader has a graphics mode using the VESA framebuffer driver which can sometimes interfere with later loading of the proper video driver. Checking this forces grub to use text mode only.
Disable _VESA framebuffer driver
vesafb is loaded early during boot so the boot logo can display, but can cause issues when switching to a real graphics driver. Checking this prevents vesafb from loading so these issues do not occur.
Disable _PAT memory
This pagetable extension can interfere with the memory management of proprietary drivers under certain situations and cause lagging or failures to allocate video memory, so turning it off can prevent those problems.
