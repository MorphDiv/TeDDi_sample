& konquest; is a game of galactic conquest for & kde;
KDE
Konquest
kdegames
Introduction
Game type:
Strategy, Board
Number of players:
Multiplayer
& konquest; is the & kde; version of Gnu-Lactic. Players conquer other planets by sending ships to them. The goal is to build an interstellar empire and ultimately conqueror all other player's planets. & konquest; can be played against other people or a computer.
How to Play
When you start & konquest;, press New to start a new game. You will see a dialog in which you need to enter player names, decide the number of planets, and how many turns are allowed. You can also use the reject button to get a new map. When you are done, click OK to start the game.
Once the game starts, you will be presented with the game board. Blank squares are empty space. At first, each player owns one planet. The planet's background is the player colour. If you move your mouse over a planet, you can see additional information. On planets which have not yet been conquered by anyone, you will only see the planet's name. The information includes:
Planet name
Owner
Ships
Production
Kill percent
The planet name is how the planet is referred to in the game. Planets are named alphabetically with uppercase letters. Owner is who owns the planet. If the planet is conquered by another player, this will change. Ships is the current number of ships on the planet. Production is the number of ships the planet will produce each turn. The production varies from planet to planet, but always remains the same. Kill percent is a measure of the effectiveness of the ships produced at that planet. Attack fleets take the kill percentage of their planet of departure, and defense fleets use the kill percentage of the planet they are defending. You can get easily see the planet name, the owner and the current number of ships on a planet in the square in which the planet lies. The owner is represented by the background color of the planet, the name is in the upper left corner and the number of ships is in the lower right corner.
To send ships from a planet to another, select the planet you want to send ships from, enter the number of ships in the green box in the upper right corner and press enter. Repeat this procedure until you have sent out all the ships you want. When you're done, press End Turn. When all players have played one turn, dialog boxes will appear and give you the latest news. The game will proceed like this until one of the players owns the entire galaxy.

Configuration
Command Reference
The Main & konquest; Window
The Planet Status indicator on the right is your source for intelligence on the state of the Galaxy. Your spies will report on the status of your rivals, but not on the native-controlled planets. The information present in the display is: Planet name, Owner, Production rate, fleet strength (Ships and Kill percent).
The Production rate is the number of ships that planet will construct in one turn. The fleet strength is the number of Ships currently in place at the planet. And, the Kill percent is a measure of the effectiveness of the ships produced at that planet. Attack fleets take the kill percentage of their planet of departure, and defense fleets use the kill percentage of the planet they are defending.
