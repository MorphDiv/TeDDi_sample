The filename filtering criteria is defined here. You can make use of wildcards. Multiple patterns are separated by space (means logical OR) and patterns are excluded from the search using the pipe symbol. If the pattern is ended with a slash (*pattern*/), that means that pattern relates to recursive search of directories. pattern - means to search those files/ directories that name is pattern, recursive search goes through all subdirectories independently of the value of patternpattern/ - means to search all files/ directories, but recursive search goes through/ excludes the directories that name is patternIt's allowed to use quotation marks for names that contain space. Filter "Programnbsp; Files" searches out those files/ directories that name is Programnbsp; Files. Examples: *. o*. h *. c? ?*. cpp *. h | *. moc. cpp* | CVS/. svn/ Note: the search term'text 'is equivalent to '*text*'.

Compare by content
Compare duplicated files with same size by content.
Ignore Date
Ignore date information during the compare process. Note: useful if the files are located on network filesystems or in archives.
Asymmetric
Asymmetric mode The left side is the destination, the right is the source directory. Files existing only in the left directory will be deleted, the other differing ones will be copied from right to left. Note: useful when updating a directory from a file server.
Ignore Case
Case insensitive filename compare. Note: useful when synchronizing Windows filesystems.

Lister mode
View the file with lister (for huge text files)

If checked, each file will open in a separate window, otherwise, the viewer will work in a single, tabbed mode
Use lister if the text file is bigger than:

Selection Mode
Krusader Mode
Both keys allow selecting files. To select more than one file, hold the Ctrl key and click the left mouse button. Right-click menu is invoked using a short click on the right mouse button.
Konqueror Mode
Pressing the left mouse button selects files - you can click and select multiple files. Right-click menu is invoked using a short click on the right mouse button.
Total-Commander Mode
The left mouse button does not select, but sets the current file without affecting the current selection. The right mouse button selects multiple files and the right-click menu is invoked by pressing and holding the right mouse button.
Ergonomic Mode
The left mouse button does not select, but sets the current file without affecting the current selection. The right mouse button invokes the context-menu. You can select with Ctrl key and the left button.
Custom Selection Mode
Design your own selection mode!
Details
Double-click selects (classic)
A single click on a file will select and focus, a double click opens the file or steps into the directory.
Obey KDE's global selection policy
Use KDE's global setting: KDE Control Center - > Peripherals - > Mouse
Based on KDE's selection mode
If checked, use a mode based on KDE's style.
Left mouse button selects
If checked, left clicking an item will select it.
Left mouse button preserves selection
If checked, left clicking an item will select it, but will not unselect other, already selected items.
Shift/ Ctrl-Left mouse button selects
If checked, shift/ ctrl left clicking will select items. Note: This is meaningless if'Left Button Selects' is checked.
Right mouse button selects
If checked, right clicking an item will select it.
Right mouse button preserves selection
If checked, right clicking an item will select it, but will not unselect other, already selected items.
Shift/ Ctrl-Right mouse button selects
If checked, shift/ ctrl right clicking will select items. Note: This is meaningless if'Right Button Selects' is checked.
Spacebar moves down
If checked, pressing the spacebar will select the current item and move down. Otherwise, current item is selected, but remains the current item.
Spacebar calculates disk space
If checked, pressing the spacebar while the current item is a directory, will (except from selecting the directory) calculate space occupied of the directory (recursively).
Insert moves down
If checked, pressing INSERT will select the current item, and move down to the next item. Otherwise, current item is not changed.
Right clicking pops context menu immediately
If checked, right clicking will result in an immediate showing of the context menu. Otherwise, user needs to click and hold the right mouse button for 500ms.
Preserve attributes for local copy/ move (slower)
Krusader will try to preserve all attributes (time, owner, group) of the local files according to the source depending on your permissions: User preserving if you are root Group preserving if you are root or member of the group Preserving the timestamp Note: This can slow down the copy process.
Automount filesystems
When stepping into a directory which is defined as a mount point in the fstab, try mounting it with the defined parameters.
MountMan wo n't (un)mount the following mount-points:
Confirmations
Request user confirmation for the following operations:
Deleting non-empty directories
