Extension Manager

UNO components;Extension Manager
extensions;Extension Manager
packages, see extensions
MW corrected typos in &quot; UNO components;... &quot; , made &quot; Extension Manager &quot; a two level entry and changed the &quot; packages &quot; reference
Extension Manager
renamed in i69568
The Extension Manager adds, removes, disables, enables and updates %PRODUCTNAME extensions.
The following are examples of %PRODUCTNAME extensions:
UNO components (compiled software modules)
Configuration data (for menu commands)
%PRODUCTNAME Basic libraries
%PRODUCTNAME dialogue box libraries
Extension files (*.oxt files containing one or more extensions of the above listed types)
Extension Scope
Users with administrator or root privileges will see a dialogue box in which they can choose to install extensions &quot; for all users &quot; or &quot; only for me &quot; .
Normal users without those privileges can install, remove, or modify extensions only for their own use.
A user with root or administrator privileges can install an extension as a shared extension that is available to all users.
After selecting an extension, a dialogue box opens and asks whether to install for the current user or all users.
A user without root privileges can only install an extension for their own use.
This is called a user extension.
