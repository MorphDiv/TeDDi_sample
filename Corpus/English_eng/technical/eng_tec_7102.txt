Introduction
Manual
The GNOME Color Manager is a framework that helps the user generate, install and manage device colors on a
The GNOME Color Manager communicates the selected profiles to color-aware applications, maintaining the color across applications.
The GNOME Color Manager uses
GNOME Color Manager should NOT be used to alter the appearance of your desktop. The Appearance preference tool lets you configure various aspects of how your desktop looks.
Usage

bash$
--verbose
gcm-apply

gcm-prefs
ICC profiles should be imported into the
gcm-import
Importing profiles

Import a ICC profile
GNOME Color Manager dialog after double clicking an ICC or ICM file
The install button will not show if the profile has been already installed.
Preferences
The preferences window allows you to control:
A device profile.
The gamma, brightness and contrast.
Basic Preferences
GNOME Color Manager basic tab
Select the device.
Select the required profile from the list in the color profile drop down box.
Select "Other profile..."
Find the ICC profile file using the GNOME Open File dialog presented.
Press the Open button on the dialog.
If the required profile is not in the list then
If the profile is invalid then the profile selected for the device will not alter. Messages may be shown.
To alter a profile for a device.
You can drag JPG and RAW files on to the main window. This will automatically create a virtual device profile that you can assign a profile to.
Advanced Preferences
GNOME Color Manager advanced tab
This allows you to adjust a calibrated device or generated profile.
The Fine Tuning Option is only available if you configure GConf to enable it (
CRT monitors have native gamma around 2.4 - 2.5 and LCD monitors usually emulate the same value.
Traditionally, Linux and MS Windows operating systems use image encoding of 1/2.2 and do not apply any gamma adjustment to the image or video card LUT. Therefore the overall gamma is expected to be around 1.1 (which is useful to allow for dim viewing conditions at home environment).
Apple used to use image encoding gamma close to 1/1.8 to naturally match the native gamma of printing devices (and therefore internally applied gamma adjustment of 1/1.45 before displaying images on monitor so that the images displayed correctly).
Nonetheless, since OS X (v10.6 Snow Leopard) the default image encoding gamma has also the value of 1/2.2 to meet the requirements of consumer imaging industry.
Before fine tuning the gamma in GNOME Color Manager, you should know what your monitor native gamma is, what display gamma you want to reach and then do the math yourself.
Profile viewer
GNOME Color Manager profiles tab
This allows you to view details about installed profiles.
Calibration and profiling

The first stage is calibration, which takes a few minutes.
The final stage is profiling (characterization), which can take over 15 minutes.
When calibrating and profiling a display you may have to change the color measuring instrument to operate in different modes. You may have to remove your instrument from the screen to change the modes. Ensure the instrument is put back on the screen after you have changed any settings.
GNOME Color Manager Instrument Configure Dialog
When calibrating and profiling a display connected using a VGA or DVI connection, often the type of device is not known. By answering correctly,

When profiling a printer you can also generate images to be sent to a print shop or photograph processing agency. The profiling details will be saved, and you will need to select the correct profiling results when you receive the proofs back.

Frequently asked questions
This section list questions frequently asked about color management
What's the difference between calibration and characterization?
Changing controls or internal settings that it has.
Applying curves to its color channels.
Many people are initially confused about the difference between calibration and characterization. Calibration is the process of modifying the color behavior of a device. This is typically done using two mechanisms:
The idea of calibration is to put a device is a defined state with regard to its color response. Often this is used as a day to day means of maintaining reproducible behavior. Typically calibration will be stored in device or systems specific file formats that record the device settings or per-channel calibration curves.
Characterization (or profiling) is
Note that a characterization (profile) will only be valid for a device if it is in the same state of calibration as it was when it was characterized.
In the case of display profiles there is some additional confusion because often the calibration information is stored in the profile for convenience. By convention it is stored in a tag called the
Missing information for whole-screen color correction
Unfortunately, many vendor-supplied ICC profiles do not include the information required for whole-screen color correction. These profiles can still be useful for applications that can do color compensation, but you will not see all the colors of your screen change.
In order to create a display profile, which includes both calibration and characterisation data, you will need to use a special color measuring instruments callled a colorimeter or a spectrometer.
Which color measuring instruments are supported?
GNOME Color Manager relies on ArgyllCMS to support color instruments. Thus the following display measuring instruments are supported:
Gretag-Macbeth Eye-One Pro (spectrometer)
Gretag-Macbeth Eye-One Monitor (spectrometer)
Gretag-Macbeth Eye-One Display 1, 2 or LT (colorimeter)
X-Rite ColorMunki Design or Photo (spectrometer)
X-Rite ColorMunki Create (colorimeter)
Pantone Huey (colorimeter)
MonacoOPTIX (colorimeter)
ColorVision Spyder 2 and 3 (colorimeter)
Colorimètre HCFR (colorimeter)
Which target types are supported?
GNOME Color Manager supports the following types of targets:
CMP DigitalTarget
ColorChecker 24
ColorChecker DC
ColorChecker SG
i1 RGB Scan 14
LaserSoft DC Pro
QPcard 201
IT8.7/2
Where do I purchase targets from?
You can purchase targets from well-known vendors like KODAK, X-Rite and LaserSoft in various online shops. Alternatively you can buy targets from
