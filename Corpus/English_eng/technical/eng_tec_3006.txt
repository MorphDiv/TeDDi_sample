(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
Returns the current active configuration setting of magic_quotes_gpc (0 for off, 1 for on).
Note:
If the directive magic_quotes_sybase is ON it will completely override magic_quotes_gpc.
So even when get_magic_quotes() returns TRUE neither double quotes, backslashes or NUL's will be escaped.
Only single quotes will be escaped.
In this case they' ll look like: ''
Keep in mind that magic_quotes_gpc can not be set at runtime.
See also addslashes(), stripslashes(), get_magic_quotes_runtime(), and ini_get().
