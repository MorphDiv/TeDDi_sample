(PHP 3 = 3.0.12, PHP 4)
Returns an array of objects containing mailbox information.
Each object has the attributes name, specifying the full name of the mailbox; delimiter, which is the hierarchy delimiter for the part of the hierarchy this mailbox is in; and attributes.
Attributes is a bitmask that can be tested against:
LATT_NOINFERIORS - This mailbox has no "children" (there are no mailboxes below this one).
LATT_NOSELECT - This is only a container, not a mailbox - you cannot open it.
LATT_MARKED - This mailbox is marked.
Only used by UW-IMAPD.
LATT_UNMARKED - This mailbox is not marked.
Only used by UW-IMAPD.
Mailbox names containing international Characters outside the printable ASCII range will be encoded and may be decoded by imap_utf7_decode().
ref should normally be just the server specification as described in imap_open(), and pattern specifies where in the mailbox hierarchy to start searching.
If you want all mailboxes, pass' * 'for pattern.
There are two special characters you can pass as part of the pattern: '*' and '%'. '* 'means to return all mailboxes.
If you pass pattern as' *', you will get a list of the entire mailbox hierarchy. '% 'means to return the current level only. '%' as the pattern parameter will return only the top level mailboxes; '~ / mail /% 'on UW_IMAPD will return every mailbox in the ~ / mail directory, but none in subfolders of that directory.
Example 1. imap_getmailboxes() example
$mbox = imap_open( "{your.imap.host}" ,"username" ,"password",OP_HALFOPEN) or die("can't connect: ".imap_last_error()); $list = imap_getmailboxes($mbox ,"{your.imap.host}" ,"*"); if(is_array($list)) {reset($list); while (list($key, $val) = each($list)) {print "($key) "; print imap_utf7_decode($val - name) .","; print "'".$val - delimiter ."' ,"; print $val - attributes." br \n";}} else print "imap_getmailboxes failed: ".imap_last_error() ."\n"; imap_close($mbox);
