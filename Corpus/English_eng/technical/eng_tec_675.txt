General Shortcut Keys in $[officename]
Using Shortcut Keys
Command+O
Ctrl+O
shortcut keys are shown next to the
Open
entry in the
File
menu.
If you want to access this function by using the shortcut keys, press and hold down
Command
Ctrl
and then press the O key.
Release both keys after the dialogue box appears.
When operating your application, you can choose between using the mouse or the keyboard for almost all of the operations available.
Calling Menus With Shortcut Keys

You can access these menus directly by pressing the underlined character together with the ALT key.
Once the menu is opened, you will again find underlined characters.
You can access these menu items directly by simply pressing the underlined character key.
Using Shortcut Keys to Control Dialogue Boxes
There is always one element highlighted in any given dialogue box - usually shown by a broken frame.
This element, which can be either a button, an option field, an entry in a list box or a check box, is said to have the focus on it.
If the focal point is a button, pressing Enter runs it as if you had clicked it.
A check box is toggled by pressing the spacebar.
If an option field has the focus, use the arrow keys to change the activated option field in that area.
Use the Tab key to go from one element or area to the next one, use Shift + Tab to go in the reverse direction.
If you place the focus on a button, not only will you will see the dotted line framing the name of the button, but also a thicker shadow under the button selected.
This indicates that if you exit the dialogue box by pressing the Enter key, it is the equivalent of pressing that button itself.
