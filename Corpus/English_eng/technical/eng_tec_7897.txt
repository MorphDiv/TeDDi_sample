Dark yellow, round film-coated tablet with bevelled edges, imprinted with “ NVR ” on one side and “ NV” on the other side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of essential hypertension.
Dafiro is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dose of Dafiro is one tablet per day.
Dafiro 5 mg/ 80 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 80 mg alone.
Dafiro can be used with or without food.
It is recommended to take Dafiro with some water.
Individual dose titration with the components (i. e. amlodipine and valsartan) is recommended before changing to the fixed dose combination.
When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed-dose combination may be considered.
For convenience, patients receiving valsartan and amlodipine from separate tablets/ capsules may be switched to Dafiro containing the same component doses.
Renal impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment Caution should be exercised when administering Dafiro to patients with hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders (see section 4.4).
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan.
Elderly (age 65 years or over) In elderly patients, caution is required when increasing the dosage.
2 Children and adolescents Dafiro is not recommended for use in patients aged below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the excipients.
Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.
Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) and patients undergoing dialysis.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Pregnancy Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy.
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and 4.6).
Sodium- and/ or volume-depleted patients Excessive hypotension was seen in 0.4% of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with Dafiro in placebo-controlled studies.
In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system (such as volume- and/ or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics) who are receiving angiotensin receptor blockers, symptomatic hypotension may occur.
Correction of this condition prior to administration of Dafiro or close medical supervision at the start of treatment is recommended.
If hypotension occurs with Dafiro, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.
Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.
Hyperkalaemia Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) should be undertaken with caution and with frequent monitoring of potassium levels.
Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Dafiro in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney.
Kidney transplantation To date there is no experience of the safe use of Dafiro in patients who have had a recent kidney transplantation.
Hepatic impairment Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver.
Particular caution should be exercised when administering Dafiro to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders.
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan.
Renal impairment No dosage adjustment of Dafiro is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR > 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2).
Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment.
3 Primary hyperaldosteronism Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease.
Heart failure As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals.
In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/ or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/ or death.
Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan.
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Dafiro has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
The possibility that more potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i. e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentration of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem cannot be excluded.
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e. g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of amlodipine.
Clinical monitoring is indicated, with possible dosage adjustment of amlodipine during the treatment with the inducer and after its withdrawal.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Others In monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid medicines (aluminium hydroxide gel, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicines.
Interactions linked to valsartan Concomitant use not recommended Lithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concurrent use of ACE inhibitors.
Despite the lack of experience with concomitant use of valsartan and lithium, this combination is not recommended.
If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended (see section 4.4).
4 Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels If a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum potassium.
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate hydration of the patient.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
Interactions common to the combination No drug interaction studies were performed with Dafiro and other medicinal products.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Other antihypertensive agents Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e. g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e. g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, an, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see also section 5.3).
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
There is no experience on the use of Dafiro in pregnant women.
Animal studies indicates that the valsartan/ amlodipine has reproductive toxicity in line with what has been described for valsartan and
5 other angiotensin II antagonists (see section 5.3).
Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of amlodipine and other calcium receptor antagonists on the health of the foetus.
However, there may be a risk of prolonged delivery.
It is not known whether valsartan and/ or amlodipine are excreted in human milk.
Valsartan was excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Because of the potential adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy, taking into account the importance of this therapy for the mother.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
When driving vehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur.
4.8 Undesirable effects

Additional information on the combination Peripheral oedema, a recognised side effect of amlodipine, was generally observed at a lower incidence in patients who received the amlodipine/ valsartan combination than in those who received amlodipine alone.
In double-blind, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of peripheral oedema by dose was as follows:
% of patients who experienced peripheral oedema
Valsartan (mg)
0 40
80
160
320
0 2.5 Amlodipine 5 (mg) 10
3.0 5.5 8.0 2.3 3.1 4.8 10.3 NA
2.4 5.4 2.3 NA
1.6 2.4 2.1 9.0
0.9 3.9 2.4 9.5
The mean incidence of peripheral oedema evenly weighted across all doses was 5.1% with the amlodipine/ valsartan combination.
Additional information on the individual components Adverse drug reactions previously reported with one of the individual components (amlodipine or valsartan) may be potential undesirable effects with Dafiro as well, even if not observed in clinical trials or during the post-marketing period.
Amlodipine Common Uncommon
Vomiting.
Alopecia, altered bowel habits, dyspepsia, dyspnoea, rhinitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia, gynaecomastia, hyperglycaemia, impotence, increased urinary frequency, leucopenia, malaise, mood changes, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, angioedema and erythema multiforme.
Rare
Arrhythmia, myocardial infarction.
Rarely, patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase.
Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) has also been reported.
These adverse events may not be distinguishable from the natural history of the underlying disease.
Very rare
Cholestatic jaundice, AST and ALT increase, purpura, rash and pruritus.
Exceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported.
Valsartan
Not known
Decrease in haemoglobin, decrease in haematocrit, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase of serum potassium, elevation of liver function values including increase of serum bilirubin, renal failure and impairment, elevation of serum creatinine, angioedema, myalgia, vasculitis, hypersensitivity including serum sickness.
7 4.9 Overdose
Symptoms There is no experience of overdose with Dafiro.
The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness.
Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia.
Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.
Treatment If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered.
Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption.
Clinically significant hypotension due to Dafiro overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.
A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use.
Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade.
Both valsartan and amlodipine are unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with dihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine), ATC code:
C09DB01
Dafiro combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines.
The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone.
Amlodipine The amlodipine component of Dafiro inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle.
The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure.
Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites.
The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels.
Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures.
These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.
Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.
As with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have
8 generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/ dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume.
In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans.
Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or humans.
In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.
Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
It acts selectively on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II.
The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 receptor.
Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
Valsartan does not inhibit ACE, also known as kininase II, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin.
Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of bradykinin or substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing.
In clinical trials where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE inhibitor (2.6% versus 7.9%, respectively).
In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry cough during ACE inhibitor therapy, 19.5% of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0% of those receiving a thiazide diuretic experienced coughing, compared to 68.5% of those treated with an ACE inhibitor (p < 0.05).
Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.
Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.
In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4– 6 hours.
The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration.
During repeated administration, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2– 4 weeks and is sustained during long-term therapy.
Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with rebound hypertension or other adverse clinical events.
Amlodipine/ Valsartan Over 1,400 hypertensive patients received Dafiro once daily in two placebo-controlled trials.
Adults with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 and < 110 mmHg) were enrolled.
Patients with high cardiovascular risks – heart failure, type I and poorly controlled type II diabetes and history of myocardial infarction or stroke within one year – were excluded.
The combination of amlodipine and valsartan produces dose-related additive reduction in blood pressure across its therapeutic dose range.
The antihypertensive effect of a single dose of the combination persisted for 24 hours.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 53% of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg.
The addition of amlodipine 10 mg and 5 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/ diastolic blood pressure of 6.0/ 4.8 mmHg and 3.9/ 2.9 mmHg, respectively, compared to patients who remained on valsartan 160 mg only.
9 A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg.
The addition of valsartan 160 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/ diastolic blood pressure of 2.9/ 2.1 mmHg compared to patients who remained on amlodipine 10 mg only.
Dafiro was also studied in an active-controlled study of 130 hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg and < 120 mmHg.
In this study (baseline blood pressure 171/ 113 mmHg), an Dafiro regimen of 5 mg/ 160 mg titrated to 10 mg/ 160 mg reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/ 29 mmHg as compared to 32/ 28 mmHg with a regimen of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/ 12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/ 12.5 mg.
In two long-term follow-up studies the effect of Dafiro was maintained for over one year.
Abrupt withdrawal of Dafiro has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.
In patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 5 mg, amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 80 mg may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema.
In patients adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg but who experience unacceptable oedema, amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.
Age, gender and race did not influence the response to Dafiro.
Dafiro has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
Valsartan has been studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure.
Amlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Linearity Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.
Amlodipine Absorption:
After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6– 12 hours.
Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%.
Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.
Distribution:
Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/ kg.
In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.
Biotransformation:
Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites.
Excretion:
Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours.
Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7– 8 days.
Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.
Valsartan Absorption:
Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2– 4 hours.
Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%.
Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t½α < 1 h and t½ß about 9 h).
Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups.
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.
10 Distribution:
The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively.
Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (94 – 97%), mainly serum albumin.
Biotransformation:
Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites.
A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan AUC).
This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive.
Excretion:
Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug.
Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/ h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/ h (about 30% of total clearance).
The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.
Amlodipine/ Valsartan Following oral administration of Dafiro, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine are reached in 3 and 6– 8 hours, respectively.
The rate and extent of absorption of Dafiro are equivalent to the bioavailability of valsartan and amlodipine when administered as individual tablets.
Special populations Paediatric patients (age below 18 years) No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.
Elderly (age 65 years or over) Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients.
In elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life.
Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the young therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage.
Renal impairment The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment.
As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.
Hepatic impairment Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40– 60% in AUC.
On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight).
Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Adverse reactions observed in animal studies with possible clinical relevance were as follows:
Histopathological signs of inflammation of the glandular stomach was seen in male rats at an exposure of about 1.9 (valsartan) and 2.6 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
At higher exposures, there were ulceration and erosion of the stomach mucosa in both females and males.
Similar changes were also seen in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5– 11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/ hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an exposure of 8– 13 (valsartan) and 7 – 8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
Similar changes were found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5– 11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
11 In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
Dilated ureters were also found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 12 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
There were only modest signs of maternal toxicity (moderate reduction of body weight) in this study.
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC).
For the single compounds there was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of essential hypertension.
Dafiro is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dose of Dafiro is one tablet per day.
Dafiro 5 mg/ 160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone.
Dafiro can be used with or without food.
It is recommended to take Dafiro with some water.
Individual dose titration with the components (i. e. amlodipine and valsartan) is recommended before changing to the fixed dose combination.
When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed-dose combination may be considered.
For convenience, patients receiving valsartan and amlodipine from separate tablets/ capsules may be switched to Dafiro containing the same component doses.
Renal impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment Caution should be exercised when administering Dafiro to patients with hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders (see section 4.4).
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan.
Elderly (age 65 years or over) In elderly patients, caution is required when increasing the dosage.
14 Children and adolescents Dafiro is not recommended for use in patients aged below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the excipients.
Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.
Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) and patients undergoing dialysis.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Pregnancy Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy.
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and 4.6).
Sodium- and/ or volume-depleted patients Excessive hypotension was seen in 0.4% of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with Dafiro in placebo-controlled studies.
In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system (such as volume- and/ or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics) who are receiving angiotensin receptor blockers, symptomatic hypotension may occur.
Correction of this condition prior to administration of Dafiro or close medical supervision at the start of treatment is recommended.
If hypotension occurs with Dafiro, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.
Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.
Hyperkalaemia Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) should be undertaken with caution and with frequent monitoring of potassium levels.
Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Dafiro in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney.
Kidney transplantation To date there is no experience of the safe use of Dafiro in patients who have had a recent kidney transplantation.
Hepatic impairment Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver.
Particular caution should be exercised when administering Dafiro to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders.
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan.
Renal impairment No dosage adjustment of Dafiro is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR > 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2).
Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment.
15 Primary hyperaldosteronism Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease.
Heart failure As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals.
In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/ or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/ or death.
Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan.
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Dafiro has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
The possibility that more potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i. e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentration of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem cannot be excluded.
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e. g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of amlodipine.
Clinical monitoring is indicated, with possible dosage adjustment of amlodipine during the treatment with the inducer and after its withdrawal.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Others In monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid medicines (aluminium hydroxide gel, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicines.
Interactions linked to valsartan Concomitant use not recommended Lithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concurrent use of ACE inhibitors.
Despite the lack of experience with concomitant use of valsartan and lithium, this combination is not recommended.
If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended (see section 4.4).
16 Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels If a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum potassium.
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate hydration of the patient.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
Interactions common to the combination No drug interaction studies were performed with Dafiro and other medicinal products.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Other antihypertensive agents Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e. g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e. g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, an, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see also section 5.3).
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
There is no experience on the use of Dafiro in pregnant women.
Animal studies indicates that the valsartan/ amlodipine has reproductive toxicity in line with what has been described for valsartan and
17 other angiotensin II antagonists (see section 5.3).
Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of amlodipine and other calcium receptor antagonists on the health of the foetus.
However, there may be a risk of prolonged delivery.
It is not known whether valsartan and/ or amlodipine are excreted in human milk.
Valsartan was excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Because of the potential adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy, taking into account the importance of this therapy for the mother.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
When driving vehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The safety of Dafiro has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with 5,175 patients, 2,613 of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine.

Additional information on the combination Peripheral oedema, a recognised side effect of amlodipine, was generally observed at a lower incidence in patients who received the amlodipine/ valsartan combination than in those who received amlodipine alone.
In double-blind, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of peripheral oedema by dose was as follows:
% of patients who experienced peripheral oedema
Valsartan (mg)
0 40
80
160
320
0 2.5 Amlodipine 5 (mg) 10
3.0 5.5 8.0 2.3 3.1 4.8 10.3 NA
2.4 5.4 2.3 NA
1.6 2.4 2.1 9.0
0.9 3.9 2.4 9.5
The mean incidence of peripheral oedema evenly weighted across all doses was 5.1% with the amlodipine/ valsartan combination.
Additional information on the individual components Adverse drug reactions previously reported with one of the individual components (amlodipine or valsartan) may be potential undesirable effects with Dafiro as well, even if not observed in clinical trials or during the post-marketing period.
Amlodipine Common Uncommon
Vomiting.
Alopecia, altered bowel habits, dyspepsia, dyspnoea, rhinitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia, gynaecomastia, hyperglycaemia, impotence, increased urinary frequency, leucopenia, malaise, mood changes, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, angioedema and erythema multiforme.
Rare
Arrhythmia, myocardial infarction.
Rarely, patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase.
Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) has also been reported.
These adverse events may not be distinguishable from the natural history of the underlying disease.
Very rare
Cholestatic jaundice, AST and ALT increase, purpura, rash and pruritus.
Exceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported.
Valsartan
Not known
Decrease in haemoglobin, decrease in haematocrit, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase of serum potassium, elevation of liver function values including increase of serum bilirubin, renal failure and impairment, elevation of serum creatinine, angioedema, myalgia, vasculitis, hypersensitivity including serum sickness.
19 4.9 Overdose
Symptoms There is no experience of overdose with Dafiro.
The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness.
Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia.
Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.
Treatment If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered.
Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption.
Clinically significant hypotension due to Dafiro overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.
A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use.
Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade.
Both valsartan and amlodipine are unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with dihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine), ATC code:
C09DB01
Dafiro combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines.
The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone.
Amlodipine The amlodipine component of Dafiro inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle.
The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure.
Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites.
The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels.
Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures.
These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.
Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.
As with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have
20 generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/ dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume.
In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans.
Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or humans.
In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.
Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
It acts selectively on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II.
The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 receptor.
Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
Valsartan does not inhibit ACE, also known as kininase II, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin.
Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of bradykinin or substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing.
In clinical trials where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE inhibitor (2.6% versus 7.9%, respectively).
In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry cough during ACE inhibitor therapy, 19.5% of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0% of those receiving a thiazide diuretic experienced coughing, compared to 68.5% of those treated with an ACE inhibitor (p < 0.05).
Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.
Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.
In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4– 6 hours.
The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration.
During repeated administration, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2– 4 weeks and is sustained during long-term therapy.
Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with rebound hypertension or other adverse clinical events.
Amlodipine/ Valsartan Over 1,400 hypertensive patients received Dafiro once daily in two placebo-controlled trials.
Adults with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 and < 110 mmHg) were enrolled.
Patients with high cardiovascular risks – heart failure, type I and poorly controlled type II diabetes and history of myocardial infarction or stroke within one year – were excluded.
The combination of amlodipine and valsartan produces dose-related additive reduction in blood pressure across its therapeutic dose range.
The antihypertensive effect of a single dose of the combination persisted for 24 hours.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 53% of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg.
The addition of amlodipine 10 mg and 5 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/ diastolic blood pressure of 6.0/ 4.8 mmHg and 3.9/ 2.9 mmHg, respectively, compared to patients who remained on valsartan 160 mg only.
21 A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg.
The addition of valsartan 160 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/ diastolic blood pressure of 2.9/ 2.1 mmHg compared to patients who remained on amlodipine 10 mg only.
Dafiro was also studied in an active-controlled study of 130 hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg and < 120 mmHg.
In this study (baseline blood pressure 171/ 113 mmHg), an Dafiro regimen of 5 mg/ 160 mg titrated to 10 mg/ 160 mg reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/ 29 mmHg as compared to 32/ 28 mmHg with a regimen of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/ 12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/ 12.5 mg.
In two long-term follow-up studies the effect of Dafiro was maintained for over one year.
Abrupt withdrawal of Dafiro has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.
In patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 5 mg, amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 80 mg may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema.
In patients adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg but who experience unacceptable oedema, amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.
Age, gender and race did not influence the response to Dafiro.
Dafiro has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
Valsartan has been studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure.
Amlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Linearity Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.
Amlodipine Absorption:
After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6– 12 hours.
Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%.
Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.
Distribution:
Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/ kg.
In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.
Biotransformation:
Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites.
Excretion:
Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours.
Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7– 8 days.
Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.
Valsartan Absorption:
Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2– 4 hours.
Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%.
Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t½α < 1 h and t½ß about 9 h).
Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups.
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.
22 Distribution:
The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively.
Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (94 – 97%), mainly serum albumin.
Biotransformation:
Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites.
A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan AUC).
This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive.
Excretion:
Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug.
Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/ h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/ h (about 30% of total clearance).
The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.
Amlodipine/ Valsartan Following oral administration of Dafiro, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine are reached in 3 and 6– 8 hours, respectively.
The rate and extent of absorption of Dafiro are equivalent to the bioavailability of valsartan and amlodipine when administered as individual tablets.
Special populations Paediatric patients (age below 18 years) No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.
Elderly (age 65 years or over) Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients.
In elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life.
Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the young therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage.
Renal impairment The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment.
As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.
Hepatic impairment Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40– 60% in AUC.
On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight).
Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Adverse reactions observed in animal studies with possible clinical relevance were as follows:
Histopathological signs of inflammation of the glandular stomach was seen in male rats at an exposure of about 1.9 (valsartan) and 2.6 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
At higher exposures, there were ulceration and erosion of the stomach mucosa in both females and males.
Similar changes were also seen in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5– 11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/ hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an exposure of 8– 13 (valsartan) and 7 – 8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
Similar changes were found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5– 11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
23 In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
Dilated ureters were also found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 12 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
There were only modest signs of maternal toxicity (moderate reduction of body weight) in this study.
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC).
For the single compounds there was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of essential hypertension.
Dafiro is indicated in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dose of Dafiro is one tablet per day.
Dafiro 10 mg/ 160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine 10 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone or with Dafiro 5 mg/ 160 mg.
Dafiro can be used with or without food.
It is recommended to take Dafiro with some water.
Individual dose titration with the components (i. e. amlodipine and valsartan) is recommended before changing to the fixed dose combination.
When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy to the fixed-dose combination may be considered.
For convenience, patients receiving valsartan and amlodipine from separate tablets/ capsules may be switched to Dafiro containing the same component doses.
Renal impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment Caution should be exercised when administering Dafiro to patients with hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders (see section 4.4).
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan.
Elderly (age 65 years or over) In elderly patients, caution is required when increasing the dosage.
26 Children and adolescents Dafiro is not recommended for use in patients aged below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the excipients.
Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.
Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) and patients undergoing dialysis.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Pregnancy Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy.
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see section 4.3 and 4.6).
Sodium- and/ or volume-depleted patients Excessive hypotension was seen in 0.4% of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with Dafiro in placebo-controlled studies.
In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system (such as volume- and/ or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics) who are receiving angiotensin receptor blockers, symptomatic hypotension may occur.
Correction of this condition prior to administration of Dafiro or close medical supervision at the start of treatment is recommended.
If hypotension occurs with Dafiro, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline.
Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.
Hyperkalaemia Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) should be undertaken with caution and with frequent monitoring of potassium levels.
Renal artery stenosis No data are available on the use of Dafiro in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney.
Kidney transplantation To date there is no experience of the safe use of Dafiro in patients who have had a recent kidney transplantation.
Hepatic impairment Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile, whereas amlodipine is extensively metabolised by the liver.
Particular caution should be exercised when administering Dafiro to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders.
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan.
Renal impairment No dosage adjustment of Dafiro is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (GFR > 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2).
Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment.
27 Primary hyperaldosteronism Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease.
Heart failure As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals.
In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/ or progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/ or death.
Similar outcomes have been reported with valsartan.
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Dafiro has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
The possibility that more potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i. e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentration of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem cannot be excluded.
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e. g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) Co-administration may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of amlodipine.
Clinical monitoring is indicated, with possible dosage adjustment of amlodipine during the treatment with the inducer and after its withdrawal.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Others In monotherapy, amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual nitroglycerin, digoxin, warfarin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, anti-acid medicines (aluminium hydroxide gel, magnesium hydroxide, simeticone), cimetidine, non- steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, antibiotics and oral hypoglycaemic medicines.
Interactions linked to valsartan Concomitant use not recommended Lithium Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concurrent use of ACE inhibitors.
Despite the lack of experience with concomitant use of valsartan and lithium, this combination is not recommended.
If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended (see section 4.4).
28 Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels If a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.
Caution required with concomitant use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/ day), and non-selective NSAIDs When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.
Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum potassium.
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate hydration of the patient.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
Interactions common to the combination No drug interaction studies were performed with Dafiro and other medicinal products.
To be taken into account with concomitant use Other antihypertensive agents Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e. g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products which may cause hypotensive adverse effects (e. g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, an, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
AIIRAs therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see also section 5.3).
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
There is no experience on the use of Dafiro in pregnant women.
Animal studies indicates that the valsartan/ amlodipine has reproductive toxicity in line with what has been described for valsartan and
29 other angiotensin II antagonists (see section 5.3).
Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse effects of amlodipine and other calcium receptor antagonists on the health of the foetus.
However, there may be a risk of prolonged delivery.
It is not known whether valsartan and/ or amlodipine are excreted in human milk.
Valsartan was excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Because of the potential adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy, taking into account the importance of this therapy for the mother.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
When driving vehicles or using machines it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or weariness may occur.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The safety of Dafiro has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with 5,175 patients, 2,613 of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine.

Additional information on the combination Peripheral oedema, a recognised side effect of amlodipine, was generally observed at a lower incidence in patients who received the amlodipine/ valsartan combination than in those who received amlodipine alone.
In double-blind, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of peripheral oedema by dose was as follows:
% of patients who experienced peripheral oedema
Valsartan (mg)
0 40
80
160
320
0 2.5 Amlodipine 5 (mg) 10
3.0 5.5 8.0 2.3 3.1 4.8 10.3 NA
2.4 5.4 2.3 NA
1.6 2.4 2.1 9.0
0.9 3.9 2.4 9.5
The mean incidence of peripheral oedema evenly weighted across all doses was 5.1% with the amlodipine/ valsartan combination.
Additional information on the individual components Adverse drug reactions previously reported with one of the individual components (amlodipine or valsartan) may be potential undesirable effects with Dafiro as well, even if not observed in clinical trials or during the post-marketing period.
Amlodipine Common Uncommon
Vomiting.
Alopecia, altered bowel habits, dyspepsia, dyspnoea, rhinitis, gastritis, gingival hyperplasia, gynaecomastia, hyperglycaemia, impotence, increased urinary frequency, leucopenia, malaise, mood changes, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, angioedema and erythema multiforme.
Rare
Arrhythmia, myocardial infarction.
Rarely, patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase.
Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) has also been reported.
These adverse events may not be distinguishable from the natural history of the underlying disease.
Very rare
Cholestatic jaundice, AST and ALT increase, purpura, rash and pruritus.
Exceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported.
Valsartan
Not known
Decrease in haemoglobin, decrease in haematocrit, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increase of serum potassium, elevation of liver function values including increase of serum bilirubin, renal failure and impairment, elevation of serum creatinine, angioedema, myalgia, vasculitis, hypersensitivity including serum sickness.
31 4.9 Overdose
Symptoms There is no experience of overdose with Dafiro.
The major symptom of overdose with valsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness.
Overdose with amlodipine may result in excessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia.
Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.
Treatment If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered.
Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption.
Clinically significant hypotension due to Dafiro overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output.
A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use.
Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade.
Both valsartan and amlodipine are unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: angiotensin II antagonists, plain (valsartan), combinations with dihydropyridine derivatives (amlodipine), ATC code:
C09DB01
Dafiro combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicines.
The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a greater degree than either component alone.
Amlodipine The amlodipine component of Dafiro inhibits the transmembrane entry of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle.
The mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure.
Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites.
The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels.
Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures.
These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.
Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.
As with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have
32 generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/ dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume.
In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans.
Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or humans.
In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.
Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
It acts selectively on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II.
The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 receptor.
Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
Valsartan does not inhibit ACE, also known as kininase II, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin.
Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of bradykinin or substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing.
In clinical trials where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE inhibitor (2.6% versus 7.9%, respectively).
In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry cough during ACE inhibitor therapy, 19.5% of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0% of those receiving a thiazide diuretic experienced coughing, compared to 68.5% of those treated with an ACE inhibitor (p < 0.05).
Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.
Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.
In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4– 6 hours.
The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration.
During repeated administration, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2– 4 weeks and is sustained during long-term therapy.
Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with rebound hypertension or other adverse clinical events.
Amlodipine/ Valsartan Over 1,400 hypertensive patients received Dafiro once daily in two placebo-controlled trials.
Adults with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥ 95 and < 110 mmHg) were enrolled.
Patients with high cardiovascular risks – heart failure, type I and poorly controlled type II diabetes and history of myocardial infarction or stroke within one year – were excluded.
The combination of amlodipine and valsartan produces dose-related additive reduction in blood pressure across its therapeutic dose range.
The antihypertensive effect of a single dose of the combination persisted for 24 hours.
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg and 62% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 53% of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg.
The addition of amlodipine 10 mg and 5 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/ diastolic blood pressure of 6.0/ 4.8 mmHg and 3.9/ 2.9 mmHg, respectively, compared to patients who remained on valsartan 160 mg only.
33 A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78% of patients treated with amlodipine/ valsartan 10 mg/ 160 mg, compared to 67% of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg.
The addition of valsartan 160 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/ diastolic blood pressure of 2.9/ 2.1 mmHg compared to patients who remained on amlodipine 10 mg only.
Dafiro was also studied in an active-controlled study of 130 hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg and < 120 mmHg.
In this study (baseline blood pressure 171/ 113 mmHg), an Dafiro regimen of 5 mg/ 160 mg titrated to 10 mg/ 160 mg reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/ 29 mmHg as compared to 32/ 28 mmHg with a regimen of lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/ 12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/ 12.5 mg.
In two long-term follow-up studies the effect of Dafiro was maintained for over one year.
Abrupt withdrawal of Dafiro has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.
In patients not adequately controlled on amlodipine 5 mg, amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 80 mg may achieve blood pressure control similar to amlodipine 10 mg with less oedema.
In patients adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg but who experience unacceptable oedema, amlodipine/ valsartan 5 mg/ 80 mg may achieve similar blood pressure control with less oedema.
Age, gender and race did not influence the response to Dafiro.
Dafiro has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
Valsartan has been studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure.
Amlodipine has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Linearity Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.
Amlodipine Absorption:
After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine are reached in 6– 12 hours.
Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%.
Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.
Distribution:
Volume of distribution is approximately 21 l/ kg.
In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients.
Biotransformation:
Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites.
Excretion:
Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours.
Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7– 8 days.
Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine.
Valsartan Absorption:
Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached in 2– 4 hours.
Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%.
Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t½α < 1 h and t½ß about 9 h).
Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, although from about 8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups.
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.
34 Distribution:
The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively.
Valsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (94 – 97%), mainly serum albumin.
Biotransformation:
Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20% of dose is recovered as metabolites.
A hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10% of the valsartan AUC).
This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive.
Excretion:
Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug.
Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 l/ h and its renal clearance is 0.62 l/ h (about 30% of total clearance).
The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.
Amlodipine/ Valsartan Following oral administration of Dafiro, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine are reached in 3 and 6– 8 hours, respectively.
The rate and extent of absorption of Dafiro are equivalent to the bioavailability of valsartan and amlodipine when administered as individual tablets.
Special populations Paediatric patients (age below 18 years) No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.
Elderly (age 65 years or over) Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients.
In elderly patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life.
Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70% in the elderly than in the young therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage.
Renal impairment The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment.
As expected for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30% of total plasma clearance, no correlation was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.
Hepatic impairment Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40– 60% in AUC.
On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic liver disease exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers (matched by age, sex and weight).
Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Adverse reactions observed in animal studies with possible clinical relevance were as follows:
Histopathological signs of inflammation of the glandular stomach was seen in male rats at an exposure of about 1.9 (valsartan) and 2.6 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
At higher exposures, there were ulceration and erosion of the stomach mucosa in both females and males.
Similar changes were also seen in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5– 11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/ hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an exposure of 8– 13 (valsartan) and 7 – 8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
Similar changes were found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5– 11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
35 In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine.
Dilated ureters were also found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 12 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).
There were only modest signs of maternal toxicity (moderate reduction of body weight) in this study.
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC).
For the single compounds there was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity.

Further information
1.
WHAT DAFIRO IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Dafiro tablets contain two substances called amlodipine and valsartan.
Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure. − Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “ calcium channel blockers”.
Amlodipine stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening. − Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “ angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”.
Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the blood pressure.
Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.
This means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening.
As a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered.
Dafiro is used to treat high blood pressure in patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with either amlodipine or valsartan on its own.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE DAFIRO
Do not take Dafiro − if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amlodipine or other medicines of the dihydropyridine type, − if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to valsartan or any of the other ingredients of Dafiro.
If you think you may be allergic, talk to your doctor before taking Dafiro. − if you have severe liver problems, such as biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. − if you have severe kidney problems or if you are having dialysis. − during the last 6 months of pregnancy, see “ Pregnancy and breastfeeding”.
If any of the above applies to you, do not take Dafiro and talk to your doctor.
Take special care with Dafiro − if you have been sick (vomiting or diarrhoea).
64 − if you are taking diuretics (a type of medicine also called “ water tablets ” which increases the amount of urine you produce). − if you are taking other medicines or substances that increase the level of potassium in your blood (e. g. some types of diuretics, potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium). − if you have liver or kidney problems. − if you have a condition affecting the renal glands called “ primary hyperaldosteronism ”. − if you have had heart failure. − if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “ aortic or mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called “ obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”).
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Dafiro.
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
Dafiro is not recommended in early pregnancy and may cause serious harm to your baby if taken after 3 months of pregnancy (see section “ Pregnancy and breast-feeding”).
The use of Dafiro in children and adolescents is not recommended.
Also tell your doctor if you have had a kidney transplant or if you had been told that you have a narrowing of your kidney arteries.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Your doctor may need to change the dose or take other precautions.
In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines.
This applies especially to the medicines listed below: − lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression); − potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other substances that may increase potassium levels; − anticonvulsant agents (e. g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone), rifampicin, St.
John’ s wort; − nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other substances called “ vasodilators ”; − medicines used for HIV/ AIDS (e. g. ritonavir) or for treatment of fungal infections (e. g. ketoconazole).
Taking Dafiro with food and drink You can take Dafiro with or without food.

An appropriate antihypertensive medication must usually replace Dafiro before starting a pregnancy.
The product should not be used during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

If you become pregnant during therapy with Dafiro, please inform and see your doctor without delay.

1.
WHAT DAFIRO IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Dafiro tablets contain two substances called amlodipine and valsartan.
Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure. − Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “ calcium channel blockers”.
Amlodipine stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from tightening. − Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “ angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”.
Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the blood pressure.
Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.
This means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening.
As a result, the blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered.
Dafiro is used to treat high blood pressure in patients whose blood pressure is not controlled enough with either amlodipine or valsartan on its own.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE DAFIRO
Do not take Dafiro − if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to amlodipine or other medicines of the dihydropyridine type, − if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to valsartan or any of the other ingredients of Dafiro.
If you think you may be allergic, talk to your doctor before taking Dafiro. − if you have severe liver problems, such as biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis. − if you have severe kidney problems or if you are having dialysis. − during the last 6 months of pregnancy, see “ Pregnancy and breastfeeding”.

70 − if you are taking diuretics (a type of medicine also called “ water tablets” which increases the amount of urine you produce). − if you are taking other medicines or substances that increase the level of potassium in your blood (e. g. some types of diuretics, potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium). − if you have liver or kidney problems. − if you have a condition affecting the renal glands called “ primary hyperaldosteronism”. − if you have had heart failure. − if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “ aortic or mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called “ obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”).
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Dafiro.
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
Dafiro is not recommended in early pregnancy and may cause serious harm to your baby if taken after 3 months of pregnancy (see section “ Pregnancy and breast-feeding”).
