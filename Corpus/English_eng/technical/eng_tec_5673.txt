Introduction
Gametype:
Arcade
Number of possible players:
Two
The idea behind & kappname; is simple, but addictive. Each of two possible players controls a satellite spaceship orbiting the sun. As the game progresses players have to eliminate opponent's spacecraft. As soon as the opponent's satellite is destroyed, the remaining player wins the round.
How to Play
Objective:
Destroy the opponent's satellite, while keeping the own one in tact.
& kappname; loads directly into the game mode; however, the action does not start until either player makes the first move.
Note:
If the opponent's satellite is controlled by the built in artificial intelligence, game action does not start until the human player makes the first move.
In & kappname; you control the ship's rotation, acceleration, and weaponry. Your satellite is constantly drawn towards the sun by gravity. You have to adjust the rotation and acceleration of your ship to make it stay on course.
Approaching the sun too close causes the satellite to explode.
In the same time you have to monitor the opponent's movement and use your weapons consisting of bullets and mines, to destroy the enemy spacecraft.
Your own weapons are as harmful to your satellite as they are to the enemy one.

Rules
About Energy Points.
Each player controls one ship.
The ships can rotate, accelerate, shoot and set mines.
Each ship has a limited amount of energy required for rotation, acceleration, shooting and setting mines.
Each ship has a limited amount of energy.
Ships absorb solar energy required for the ship's operation. The amount of energy the ship gets depends on the distance from and the direction to the sun.
A ship gets more energy near the sun and less energy near the border. It gets the full amount of energy if the sun shines directly on the solar panels and less or even no energy if the sun shines at an angle to the panels or at the other side of the panels.
About Bullets and Mines.
Bullets fly around the sun just like a ship does.
Mines have an amount of energy to stay at the same position. When the energy is spent, the mines collide with the sun and disintegrate.
The closer to the sun the mine is set, the more energy it needs to stay in place.
Mines can be destroyed with bullets.
By default each ship has 5 bullets and 3 mines.
About Hit Points
Collision with own bullets, or enemy bullets or mines decreases the hit points.
If two ships collide then the weaker ship is destroyed and the hit points of the stronger ship are decreased by the amount of the hit points the weaker ship had.
If the satellite's amount of hit points goes to zero then satellite explodes.
If a satellite collides with the sun it is destroyed regardless of the amount of hit points remaining.
Powerups
From time to time powerups appear on the play field.
There are four different powerups:
Mine
The maximum number of mines is increased.
Bullet
The maximum number of bullets is increased.
Energy (yellow sphere)
Player's energy increases.
Shield (blue sphere)
Player's hit points increase.
