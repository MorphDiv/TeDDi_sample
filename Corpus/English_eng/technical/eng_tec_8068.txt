EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
XELEVIA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Xelevia?
Xelevia is a medicine containing the active substance sitagliptin.
It is available as round tablets.
What is Xelevia used for?
Xelevia is used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes, to improve control of blood sugar levels.
It is used with diet and exercise, together with one or more antidiabetes medicines: • in combination with metformin, in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin alone; • in combination with a sulphonylurea in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled with a sulphonylurea alone and in whom metformin is not suitable; • in combination with both metformin and a sulphonylurea, when both medicines are not sufficient to give satisfactory control of the patient ’ s diabetes; • in combination with a PPAR gamma agonist, such as a thiazolidinedione, in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled on the PPAR gamma agonist alone.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Xelevia used?
Xelevia is taken at a dose of 100 mg once a day, with or without food.
There is no need to change the doses of the other medicines Xelevia is taken with, except when Xelevia is taken with a sulphonylurea.
In such cases, the dose of the sulphonylurea may be lowered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels).
Xelevia is not recommended for use in patients who have moderate or severe problems with their kidneys, or in patients aged less than 18 years.
How does Xelevia work?
Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood or when the body is unable to use insulin effectively.
The active substance in Xelevia, sitagliptin, is a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.
It works by blocking the breakdown of ‘ incretin’ hormones in the body.
These hormones are released after a meal and stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin.
By increasing levels of incretin hormones in the blood, sitagliptin stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin when blood sugar levels are high.
Sitagliptin does not work when the blood sugar is low.
Sitagliptin also reduces the amount of sugar made by the liver, by increasing insulin levels and decreasing the levels of the hormone glucagon.
Together, these processes reduce blood glucose levels and help to control type 2 diabetes.

How has Xelevia been studied?
The effects of Xelevia were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
Xelevia was studied in five main studies lasting up to a year, involving almost 4,000 patients with type 2 diabetes whose blood sugar levels were not adequately controlled.
Four of the studies compared Xelevia to placebo (a dummy treatment), either taken alone (two studies involving 1,262 patients), or as an add-on to metformin (in 702 patients) or to the PPAR gamma agonist pioglitazone (in 353 patients).
The fifth study compared Xelevia to glipizide (a sulphonylurea), as an add-on to metformin in 1,172 patients.
An additional study compared Xelevia to placebo, when used as an add-on to treatment with glimepiride (another sulphonylurea), with or without metformin, in 441 patients.
In all studies, the main measure of effectiveness was the change in the level of a substance in the blood called glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled.
What benefit has Xelevia shown during the studies?
Xelevia was more effective than placebo when it was taken alone or in combination with other antidiabetes medicines.
In combination with metformin, a daily dose of 100 mg Xelevia reduced HbA1c by 0.70% (from 7.96 to 7.26%) after 24 weeks, compared to a fall of 0.08% in the patients adding placebo.
In combination with pioglitazone, 100 mg Xelevia reduced HbA1c levels by 0.88% after 24 weeks, compared to 0.18% in the patients adding placebo.
In the study comparing Xelevia and glipizide as an add-on to metformin, glipizide was initially more effective than Xelevia in reducing HbA1c levels.
However, in patients continuing to take Xelevia or glipizide, the two medicines had similar levels of effectiveness after a year of treatment.
Xelevia was also more effective than placebo when it was added to glimepiride (with and without metformin).
This reduced HbA1c levels after 24 weeks by 0.30% in patients receiving Xelevia and glimepiride, and by 0.60% in the patients who were also taking also taking metformin in addition to Xelevia and glimepiride.
What is the risk associated with Xelevia?
The most common side effect when taking Xelevia with other medicines is hypoglycaemia.
This is seen in more than 1 patient in 10 when Xelevia is taken with a sulphonylurea (with or without metformin) and in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 when Xelevia is taken with a PPAR gamma agonist.
When Xelevia is taken with metformin only, the most common side effect (seen in between 1 and 100 patients in 100) is nausea (feeling sick).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Xelevia, see the Package Leaflet.
Xelevia should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to sitagliptin or any of the other ingredients.
Why has Xelevia been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Xelevia’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with metformin and/ or a sulphonylurea, or a PPAR gamma agonist, when diet and exercise plus the other medicines do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
The Committee recommended that Xelevia be given marketing authorisation.
