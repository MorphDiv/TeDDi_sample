Text:
Any text that serves as a comment.
You can use the single quotation mark instead of the Rem keyword to indicate that the text on a line is comments.
This symbol can be inserted directly to the right of the program code, followed by a comment.

To continue comment lines, you must enter &quot; Option Compatible &quot; in the same Basic module.

Sub ExampleMid
DIM sVar As String
