You can set the transparency value to be used as a threshold by using the slider or by entering a value between 0 and 255 in the input box. All transparency values above this threshold will become opaque and all transparency values below or equal to this threshold will become completely transparent. The transition is abrupt.
This command will never make completely transparent pixels (alpha value = 0) opaque.

If you enlarge a layer, the missing pixels are calculated by interpolation, but no new details are added. The more the layer is enlarged, and the more times it is enlarged, the more blurred it becomes. The exact result of the enlargement depends upon the interpolation method you choose. After scaling, you can improve the result by using the

Initialize Layer Mask to
This dialog allows you several choices for the initial contents of the layer mask:
White (full opacity)
With this option, the layer mask will make all of the layer fully opaque. That means that you will not notice any difference in the appearance of the layer until you paint on the layer mask.
Black (full transparency)
With this option, the layer mask will make all of the layer fully transparent. This is represented in the image by a checkered pattern on which you will need to paint to make any part of the layer visible.
Layer's alpha channel
With this option, the contents of the alpha channel are used to fill the layer mask. The alpha channel itself is not altered, so the transparency of partially visible areas is increased, leading to a more transparent layer.
Transfer layer's alpha channel
This option sets the layer mask as the previous option, but resets the layer's alpha channel to full opacity afterwards. The effect is to transfer the transparency information from the alpha channel to the layer mask, leaving the layer with the same appearance as before. The visibility of the layer is now determined by the layer mask alone and not by the alpha channel. If in doubt, select this option instead of
This option converts the current selection into a layer mask, so that selected areas are opaque, and unselected areas are transparent. If any areas are partially selected, you can click on the
