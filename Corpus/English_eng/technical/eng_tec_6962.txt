Overview

Original image
Filter
The Wind filter can be used to create motion blur, but it can also be used as a general distort filter. What is characteristic about this filter is that it will render thin black or white lines. Wind will detect the edges in the image, and stretch out thin white or black lines from that edge. This is why you can create the illusion of motion, because the edges are what will be blurred in a photograph of a moving object.
Activating the filter
You can find this filter through
Options

The interface is quite simple. You can set the
You can only set the wind in two directions, either Left or Right. However, you can control which edge the wind will come from using the values Leading, Trailing or Both. Because Trailing will produce a black wind, it creates a less convincing motion blur than Leading, which will produce white wind.

Filter
This filter works on color borders. It spreads pixels that differ in a specified way from their neighbouring pixels.
This filter is found in the image window menu under

The result of your settings will appear in the Preview without affecting the image until you click on
Mode
The examples will be about the following image:
More white (larger value)
Pixels will be propagated from upper value pixels towards lower value pixels. So bright areas will enlarge.
More white
Bright pixels have been propagated to dark pixels in the four directions : top, bottom, right and left. Filter applied several times to increase effect.
More black (smaller value)
Pixels will be propagated from lower value pixels towards upper value pixels. So dark areas will enlarge.
More black
To bottom only
The same as above with
Middle value to peaks
On a border between the selected thresholds, the average of both values is propagated.
A thin border with a transitional color has been added to objects. It is not visible around objects with smoothed borders.
Green area zoomed x800. A thin border (one pixel wide) has been added. Its value is the average between grey (90%) and green (78%) : (90 + 78) / 2 = 84.
Foreground to peaks
The propagated areas will be filled with the foreground color of the toolbox.
In this example, the foreground color in Toolbox is Red. A thin border, one pixel wide, red, is added around objects. With smoothed objects, this border is located at the furthest limit of smoothing. Here, another border appears inside. This is an artifact due to the small size of the object which makes the smoothing area of opposite sides to overlap.
Only foreground
Only areas with the Toolbox Foreground color will propagate.
In this example, the foreground color in Toolbox is that of the green object. After applying filter several times, the green area is clearly enlarged.
Only background
Only areas with the Background color will propagate.
More opaque / transparent
These commands work like More White and More Black. Opaque (transparent) areas will be propagated over less opaque (transparent) areas. These commands need an image with an Alpha channel.
More opaque
Original layer, with a transparent background.
Filter applied several times: the green, opaque, area got increased.
Propagate
Lower / Upper threshold
A pixel will be propagated (spread) if the difference in value between the pixel and its neighbour is no smaller than the lower threshold and no larger than the upper threshold.
Propagating rate
That's the propagating amount. The higher it will be the more colored the propagation will be.
Propagating direction
You can select one or more directions.
Propagating alpha channel
If checked, the pixel alpha value will be propagated, otherwise the pixel will get the alpha of the neighbouring pixels. This checkbox is only visible when the active layer has an alpha channel.
Propagating value channel
If checked, the pixel's color channels (gray channel on grayscaled images) will be propagated. The option is checked by default, of course. This checkbox too is only visible when the active layer has an alpha channel.

Newsprint
Applying example for the Newsprint filter
Filter
This filter halftones the image using a clustered-dot dither. Halftoning is the process of rendering an image with multiple levels of grey or color (i.e. a continuous tone image) on a device with fewer tones; often a bi-level device such as a printer or typesetter.
The basic premise is to trade off resolution for greater apparent tone depth (this is known as spatial dithering).
There are many approaches to this, the simplest of which is to throw away the low-order bits of tone information; this is what the posterize filter does. Unfortunately, the results don't look too good. However, no spatial resolution is lost.
This filter uses a clustered-dot ordered dither, which reduces the resolution of the image by converting cells into spots which grow or shrink according to the intensity that cell needs to represent.
Imagine a grid super-imposed on the original image. The image is divided into cells by the grid - each cell will ultimately hold a single spot made up of multiple output pixels in order to approximate the darkness of the original image in that cell.
Obviously, a large cell size results in a heavy loss in resolution! The spots in the cells typically start off as circles, and grow to be diamond shaped. This change in shape is controlled by a

Spot Function

Proper halftoning does not need antialiasing: the aim is to reduce the color depth after all! However, since this plugin is mainly for special effects, the results are displayed on screen rather than by a black/white printer. So it is often useful to apply a little anti-aliasing to simulate ink smearing on paper. If you do want to print the resulting image then set the antialising to 1 (ie, off).
