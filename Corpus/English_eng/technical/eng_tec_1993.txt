Preventing Hyphenation of Specific Words
MW created this guide from splitting using_hyphen.xhp
automatically hyphenated
and certain hyphenated words look ugly, or if you want specific words never to be hyphenated you can switch off hyphenation for those words:
Tools - Options - Language Settings - Writing Aids
User-defined dictionary
list, and then click
Edit
.
New
to create a dictionary.
Word
box, type the word you want to exclude from hyphenation, followed by an equal sign (=), for example, &quot; pretentious= &quot; .
New
, and then click
Close
.
Format - Character
, click the
Font
tab, and select &quot; None &quot; in the
Language
box.
Some words contain special characters that %PRODUCTNAME treats as a hyphen.
If you do not want such words to be hyphenated, you can insert a special code that prevents hyphenation at the position where the special code is inserted.
Proceed as follows:
Tools - Options - Language Settings - Languages
and check
Enabled for complex text layout (CTL)
.
Click OK.
Position the cursor at the place where no hyphenation should occur.
Insert - Formatting Mark - No-width no break
.
Once the special character is inserted, you might disable CTL again.
Support of CTL was only necessary to insert the special character.
