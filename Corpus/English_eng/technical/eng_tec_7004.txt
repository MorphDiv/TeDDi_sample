Decomposition to layers (RGB)
Command
This command separates the channels (RGB, HSV, CMYK...) of an image into separated images or layers.

Options

Extract Channels
Following options are described with
Color model
If the RGB radio button is clicked, a grey level image is created with three layers (Red, Green and Blue), and two channels (Grey and Alpha).
This function is interesting when using Threshold tool. You can also perform operations like cutting, pasting or moving selections in a single RBG channel. You can use an extracted grayscale as a selection or mask by saving it in a channel (right-clickgt;Selectgt;Save to a channel).
RGBA
If the RGBA radio button is clicked, a image is created similar at the RGB Decomposing with a additional Alpha layer filled with the transparencies values of the source image. Full transparent pixels are black and the full opaque pixels are white.
This option decomposes image into three greyscaled layers, one for Hue, one for Saturation and another for Value.

LAB
This option decomposes image into three greyscaled layers, layer
The LAB Decomposing is a color model of the Luminance-Color family. A channel is used for the Luminosity while two other channels are used for the Colors. The LAB color model is used by Photoshop.
In
The YCbCr color model also called YUV is now used for digital video (initially for PAL analog video). It's based on the idea that the human eye is most sensitive to luminosity, next to colors. The YCbCr Decomposing use a transformation matrix and the different options are different values recommended by ITU (International Telecommunication Union) applied to the matrix .
Decompose to Layers
If this option is checked, a new grey-scaled image is created, with each layer representing one of the channels of the selected mode. If this option is not checked, every channel is represented with a specific image automatically and clearly named in the name bar.

Crop marks

Black component
(Magenta and Yellow components omitted.)
This option is for specialists. It is related to CMYK printing. When checked, every pixel of the current foreground color will be black in each component of the decomposed images/layers. This allows you to make crop marks visible on all channels, providing a useful reference for alignment. A thin cross printed in registration black can also be used to check whether the printing plates are lined up.

Example for the
Decomposed image (RGB decomposition)

This command constructs an image from several grayscale images or layers, for instance from extracted RGB, HSV... components. You can also build an image from grayscale images or layers created independently.
You can find this command in the image window menu under

Compose Channels
You can select there the color space to be used: RGB, HSV... The options are described in the following
Channel Representation
Allows you to select which channel will be affected to each image channel. You may use this option, for example, to exchange color channels:

Channel Mixer

Example for the

This command combines values of the RGB channels. It works with images with or without an alpha channel. It has monochrome mode and a preview.
You can find this command through

Output Channel
From this menu you select the channel to mix to. Choices are Red, Green, or Blue. It is insensitive when
Red, Green, Blue
These three sliders set the contribution of red, green or blue channel to output. Can be negative. These sliders are graduated from -200 to 200. They represent the percentage which will be attributed to the output channel. 100% corresponds to the value of the channel of the studied pixel in the image.
Monochrome
This option converts the RGB image into a gray-scale RGB image. The Channel Mixer command is often used with this aim in view, because it often provides a better result than the other ways (see
The 21%, 72%, 7% settings give you the same gray luminosity (Value) as the Grayscale command in Image/Mode. (They were 30%, 59%, 11% in v2.2).
Preserve Luminosity
Calculations may result in too high values and an image too much clear. This option lessens luminosities of the color channels while keeping a good visual ratio between them. So, you can change the relative weight of the colors without changing the overall luminosity.

How does Channel Mixer work?
In RGB mode
In this mode, you have to select an
Three RGB sliders let you give a percentage to every channel. For every pixel in the image, the sum of the calculated values for every channel from these percentages will be given to the Output Channel. Here is an example:
The original image and its channels
RGB values of the pixels in red, green, blue, gray squares are displayed. The black rectangle is special, because black (0;0;0) is not concerned by the command (0 multiplied by any percentage always gives 0). The result can't exceed 255 nor be negative.
Output channel is red. Green Channel +50
In the red square, the pixel values are 230;10;10. Relative values are 1;0.5;0. The calculation result is 230*1 + 10*0,5 + 10*0 =235. The same reasoning is valid for the green and the blue squares.
In the gray square, which contains red color, the calculation result is above 255. It is reduced to 255. A negative value would be reduced to 0.
Output channel is red. Green Channel +50%. The Preserve Luminosity option is checked.
The values attributed to the Red Output channel are lower, preventing a too much clear image.
In Monochrome mode
When this option is checked, the image preview turns to grayscale, but the image is still a RGB image with three channels, until the command action is validated.
Monochrome option checked. Red: 100% Green: 50% Blue: 0%. Preserve Luminosity unchecked.
In every square, pixels have been converted into a gray level equal to the value of the Red channel in the original image (The background has been painted with pink afterwards to make all squares visible).
