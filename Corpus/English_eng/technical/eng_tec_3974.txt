(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a positive MySQL persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
mysql_pconnect() establishes a connection to a MySQL server.
The following defaults are assumed for missing optional parameters: server = 'localhost:3306', username = name of the user that owns the server process and password = empty password.
The client_flags parameter can be a combination of the constants MYSQL_CLIENT_SSL, MYSQL_CLIENT_COMPRESS, MYSQL_CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE or MYSQL_CLIENT_INTERACTIVE.
The server parameter can also include a port number. eg. "hostname:port" or a path to a socket eg. ": / path / to / socket" for the localhost.
Note:
Support for ":port" was added in 3.0B4.
Support for the ": / path / to / socket" was added in 3.0.10.
mysql_pconnect() acts very much like mysql_connect() with two major differences.
First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent) link that's already open with the same host, username and password.
If one is found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.
Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution of the script ends.
Instead, the link will remain open for future use (mysql_close() will not close links established by mysql_pconnect()).
The optional client_flags parameter became available in PHP 4.3.0.
This type of link is therefore called 'persistent'.
Note:
Note, that these kind of links only work if you are using a module version of PHP.
See the Persistent Database Connections section for more information.
Warning
Using persistent connections can require a bit of tuning of your Apache and MySQL configurations to ensure that you do not exceed the number of connections allowed by MySQL.
