Filter
This filter allows you to colorize old black-and-white images by mapping a color source image or a gradient against it.
Your gray-tone image must be changed to RGB before using this filter (Image/Imagegt;Modegt;RGB).

The filter window is divided into two parts: Destination on the left, Sampling on the right.
Destination, Sample
By default, displayed image previews reproduce the image you invoked the filter from.


Show Selection
This option toggles between the whole image and the selection, if it exists.
Show Colors
This option toggles between colors and gray-scale.
Get Sample Colors
When you click on this button, the gradient bar below the sample preview displays colors of the sample. If your sample holds few colors, transitions may be abrupt. Check

Out Levels
Two input boxes and two sliders act the same: they limit the color range which will be applied to destination image. You can choose this range accurately. Result appears interactively in destination preview.
In Levels
Three input boxes and three sliders allow to fix importance of dark tones, mid tones and light tones. Result appears interactively in destination preview.
Hold Intensity
If this option is checked, the average light intensity of destination image will be the same as that of source image.
Original Intensity
If this option is checked, the In levels intensity settings will not be taken in account: original intensity will be preserved.

Palette Map
Map
This plug-in recolors the image using colors from the active palette that you choose in
It maps the contents of the specified drawable (layer, selection...) with the active palette. It calculates luminosity of each pixel and replaces the pixel by the palette sample at the corresponding index. A complete black pixel becomes the lowest palette entry, and complete white becomes the highest. Works on both Grayscale and RGB image with/without alpha channel.
You can access this filter in the image window menu under
Example
The active palette is applied to a gradient image
The current palette, with 18 colors
The colors of the active palette are applied to a black to white gradient. The color with the lowest index in the palette (orange) replaces the black color in the gradient. The color with the highest index in the palette (red) replaces the white color in the gradient. The other colors spread out in the order of the palette.
