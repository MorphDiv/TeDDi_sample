The Menu Entries
The File Menu
Ctrl; N File
Creates a new project. You have to choose the project type (Audio CD, Data DVD,...).
Ctrl; O File Open...
Opens an existing project which can be selected with KDE's Open File dialog.
Ctrl; R File
This is a shortcut to re-open recently opened projects. The sub-menu belonging to this item contains a list of these projects, clicking on a specific file will open it again.
Ctrl; S File Save
Saves the current project. If there has already been a save of the document then this will overwrite the previously saved file without asking for the user's consent. If it is the first save of a new document the Save As dialog will be invoked.
File Save As...
Saves the current project with a new file name. KDE's Save As dialog appears to specify name and directory of the new project file.
File Save All
Saves all open projects. This is the same as selecting File Save for each of them.
Ctrl; C File Close
Closes the current project. If a project has been modified but not yet saved then & k3b; will ask what to do. You can choose to save or discard the changes, and you also have the opportunity to cancel closing and keep the project open.
File Close All
Closes all open projects. For each unsaved project & k3b; will ask what to do, just like it does when File Close is selected.
Ctrl; Q File Quit
Quits & k3b; after closing all of its open projects. For every unsaved project & k3b; will ask what to do, just like it does when File Close is selected.
The Project Menu
Project Add Files...
When this item is selected, the appearing dialog lets you choose one or more files to be added to the project. This has the same effect as dragging files directly from the Contents View into the Project View. If the current project is a data disc project, the added files will appear in the disc's root directory.
Project Clear Project
Removes all files and directories from the current project. The project itself remains open.
Ctrl; B Project Burn...
Opens the Burn dialog for the current project. This is in fact the same as the Properties dialog - the only difference is that there is an additional Burn button which causes & k3b; to burn a disc from project data. The Burn dialog wo n't open if the project does not contain any files.
Ctrl; P Project Properties...
Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. Here you can specify a lot of options concerning the project. Every project type has got a different set of options, most of them can be explained by using What's This (accessible by right-mouse-clicking).
Project Import Session
This Item only appears if a Data CD/ DVD or Video DVD project is active. It causes K3b to import the file entries from the previous session to the current project. You can use this when compiling files for multi-session discs. Hence that data from the previous session is always included, even if you do n't choose to make use of this command. It just helps to know what's on the disc already.
Project Clear Imported Session
This Item only appears if a Data CD/ DVD or Video DVD project is active. It causes K3b to remove the file entries from the current project that were imported by Project Import Session while keeping all of the other data in the project. Hence that making use of this command does n't actually remove anything from the disc that will be burned, it just hides these files again.
Project Edit Boot Images
This Item only appears if a Data CD/ DVD or Video DVD project is active. Here you can specify boot images in order to create bootable CDs or DVDs. A boot image can be a direct copy of a floppy or hard disk (for example, created by the dd shell command) as well as another disc's boot image. In any case it's a single file containing a complete, bootable system that is burned as a normal file. In order to let the computer know that the disc contains a boot image, the burning application creates a boot catalog file whose name can be determined in the dialog window.
The Tools Menu
Tools Copy CD...
Opens the CD Copy dialog. Without the need of a project file, it provides the ability to copy a CD's content to another disc. Alternatively, you can choose only to create an image of the source CD which can be burned anytime. There is also an option to clone the CD instead of normal copying, which should be preferred when copying CDs with defective sectors or Video CDs.
Tools Copy DVD...
Opens the DVD Copy dialog. Without the need of a project file, it provides the ability to copy a DVD's content to another disc. Alternatively, you can choose only to create an image of the source DVD which can be burned anytime. Video transcoding within the DVD Copy dialog is not yet supported, so the destination disc has to be large enough to contain all of the source disc's (video) data in its original form.
Tools Erase CD-RW...
Opens the Erase CD-RW dialog. With its help you can clear the contents of a CD-RW, or part of it.
Tools Format DVDÂ±RW...
Opens the DVD Formatting dialog. With its help you can format a DVD-R(W) or DVD+R(W), which causes the disc's contents to be deleted. & k3b; gives the choice between the "Overwrite" and "Incremental" writing modes.
Tools Burn CD Image...
Burns a previously created CD image. The Burn CD Image dialog asks to select an *. iso, *. cue or *. toc file as data source that you can instantly burn by pressing the Start button. (Nero *. nrg files are currently not supported, so you have to make use of other tools like Nrg2Iso.)
Tools Burn DVD ISO Image...
Burns a previously created DVD image. The Burn Iso9660 Image dialog asks to select an *. iso file as data source that you can instantly burn by pressing the Start button.
Tools Encode Video...
A DVD video that has already been ripped can be encoded with a little help from the Encoding Video dialog. This dialog box normally opens after ripping the DVD from within the Contents View, but can also be used standalone. It contains information about the ripped DVD video, encoding options and even video resizing and cropping abilities.
Tools Diskinfo
Shows information about the inserted disk. This information will be displayed in the Contents View and covers disk properties like type, size and track length of the CD or DVD in your drive.
The Settings Menu
Settings Toolbars
Pops up a list of & k3b; 's toolbars. If a toolbar entry is checked, it means that the toolbar is currently visible.
Settings Show/ Hide Statusbar
This enables you to show or hide the small bar at the bottom of the main window containing various information about & k3b; 's status and activities.
Settings Show Directories
Toggles the visibility of the Directory View. This view enables you to select directories and disc drives. When selected, their contents will appear in the Contents View. Disc drives have also got a context menu providing functions like Disk Info, (un)mounting the drive or ejecting the medium.
Settings Show Contents
Toggles the visibility of the Contents View. This view enables you to select files that can be dragged into the Project View in order to add them to the project. The Contents View also acts as an interface to rip audio CDs and video discs when a disc drive containing an appropriate CD/ DVD is selected in the Directory View.
Settings Show Document Header
Toggles the visibility of the document header belonging to the Project View. This is a small bar that is only visible if the Project View contains any open projects. The document header has no functionality, yet it's nice eye candy and improves clarity by separating the Project View from the other views.
Settings Configure Shortcuts...
This command opens a dialog box where the key bindings for & k3b; 's menu commands may be changed. After selecting one of the available commands from the upper part of the dialog, the shortcut for this action can be changed in the lower part.
Settings Configure Toolbars...
This command opens a dialog box where the toolbars can be customized. The drop down box on top of the dialog determines which toolbar can be edited at the moment. The Available Actions list on the left contains all commands that can be added to the toolbar, the Current Actions list on the right shows the ones that are already there. Items can be added by selecting the appropriate command out of the Available Actions list and pressing the right button to move it to the Current Actions list. Removing an item works the other way round. The up and down buttons change the commands's position within the toolbar.
Settings k3b; Setup
This opens & k3bsetup; which helps setting the right permissions needed by & k3b; in order to burn CDs and DVDs. Linux 'user rights management permits program execution and access to disc drives if no permissions have been granted by the administrator. & k3bsetup; cannot set permissions without administrator privileges, so you have to enter the root password when starting up.
Settings Configure & k3b;...
Opens the Options dialog where general program settings can be configured. Although most of & k3b; 's functionality should work out of the box, this dialog allows to customize and fine-tune the program.
