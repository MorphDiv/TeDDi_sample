Budgets
What is a budget?
A budget is a categorized list of expected income and expenses for a period.
The Budget facility of & kappname; allows you to create annual budgets. More than one Budget can be created for any year. You set monthly Budget values against any Income or Expense categories that you have defined. The values can be set in three ways, depending on the Period:
Monthly
(Default) specify a single value applied to every month in the Budget
Yearly
specify a single value to divide evenly across each month in the Budget
Individual
specify separate values for each month.
This is used for income and expenses spread irregularly through the year.
& kappname; provides a number of reports which compare actual income and expenses against the entered Budgets.
Your budgets
You can access your budgets by clicking the appropriate icon in the navigation pane at the left hand side of your & kappname; window.
Creating, changing, and deleting budgets
This section of the Budgets window displays the list of Budgets contained in the current file. If no Budget has yet been created the list will display a single empty Budget called "Budget & lt; yeargt;" where & lt; yeargt; is the current fiscal year. The list of Budgets has two columns:
Name
Name of the Budget
Year
Fiscal year of the Budget
Values from the selected Budget are displayed to the right. To select a different Budget you can click on the Budget in the list. Alternatively, when the list has focus, you can select a different Budget using the up and down keys. If you have made changes to a Budget and then select a different budget & kappname; will ask you whether you want to discard the changes.
There are five buttons above the list of Budgets.
New
Create a new budget
Rename
Edit the name of the selected Budget.
You can also edit the name of a Budget by clicking on the name of the selected Budget or double-clicking on the name of a different Budget.
Delete
Delete the selected Budget
Revert
Reverts the selected Budget to its last stored state.
Save
Accepts any unsaved changes to the selected Budget and stores them.
Additional options are available on a menu accessed by right-clicking on a Budget.
New Budget
Create a new, blank Budget.
Rename Budget
Rename the selected Budget.
Change budget year
Displays a window with a list of years to select a different budget year.
Delete budget
Delete the selected Budget.
Copy budget
Creates a copy of the selected Budget. The new Budget has the name "Copy of & lt; budgetgt;", where & lt; budgetgt; is the name of the copied Budget.
Account List
The Account List displays the list of Income and Expense Categories. As in other places in & kappname; the list is organized in a tree structure. The list can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide Subcategories within a Category. The Account List has a number of columns:
Account
Account name
Type
Account Type (Income or Expense)
Tax
Checked if a Category included in Tax Reports
VAT
Checked if a Category marked as a VAT Category
Balance
Current balance of Account. Blank for Categories
Value
Total yearly value in the Budget. If an Account has Subaccounts and the Account's list of Subaccounts is collapsed the value displayed is the sum of the values for the Account and all of its Subaccounts.
The Account List can be filtered using "Hide unused Categories". In Budgets this hides any Categories for which no value has been assigned to the Category or any of its Subcategories.
Assignments
The Assignments area shows the value for the selected Account.
Displays the name of the selected Account. If the Account is a Subaccount, the full name of the selected Account is displayed in the Account: Subaccount format.
Total
Displays the total yearly value assigned to the Account
Include subaccounts
In Reports show actual income or expenses in Subcategories belonging to the Category against the Category instead of the Subcategory.
If a Subcategory has a value defined in the Budget the income and expenses are shown against the Subcategory.
Clear
The Clear button resets the budgeted account value or values to zero.
Period
The Period radio buttons allow you to select the period for which the value applies
A single value is entered, specifying the amount per month. This is the default setting.
A single value is entered, specifying the amount per year.
Values are specified for each Calendar month. This is used where expense or income is spread irregularly through the year.
If a value is or values are already specified and the Period is changed & kappname; will ask whether to use the current total yearly value to assign the new values.
Update and Revert
For performance reasons, changes made to a Budget are not saved immediately. Instead, they first have to be stored using the Update button and then permanently saved using the & kappname; Save.
When a Budget's values are first modified, the Update and Revert buttons are enabled. Multiple changes can be made to the Budget. Pressing Update will store the changes, disable the Update and Revert buttons and enable the & kappname; Save.
The & kappname; Save only saves changes that have been stored using the Update button. Thus, if you have modified a Budget but not yet stored the changes & kappname; Save will not affect the modified Budget and the Update and Revert buttons remain enabled.
Revert undoes any changes made to a Budget since the last Update and disables the Update and Revert buttons.
Changes stored using Update but not yet saved using & kappname; Save can only be reverted by reloading the & kappname; file.
Budget Reports
& kappname; provides a number of reports to compare actual income and expenses against Budgets. These are listed in Reports under "Budgeting". There are two types of Reports:
Budget only
Reports displaying values from a Budget: Monthly Budget Displays the monthly values from a Budget. Yearly Budget Displays the monthly values from a Budget, with yearly total.
Compare Budget and Actual
Reports comparing values from a Budget to actual income and expenses. In each budget report you can find the columns Budget, Actual and Difference. Each report differs in the period that is shown:
Budget vs. Actual This Year:
From the beginning of the year until today
Budget vs. Actual This Year (YTM):
From the beginning of the year until the last day of the previous month
Yearly Budgeted vs. Actual:
From January 1st until December 31st
Monthly Budgeted vs. Actual:
From the beginning of the year until the last day of the current month
Yearly Budgeted vs. Actual (Graph):
Same as the previous report but it shows the graph by default
These reports provide a base from which custom reports can be created by changing the date range and Budget, among other options.
Reports comparing values from a Budget to actual income and expenses: Budget vs. Actual This Year Month-by-month comparison for the current year so far, with total. Monthly Budget vs. Actual Month-by-month comparison, defaulting to the current month. Yearly Budgeted vs. Actual Month-by-month comparison for the whole of the current year, with total. These reports provide a base from which custom reports can be created by changing the date range and Budget. Of the Budget reports, only the "Budget vs. Actual This Year" does not allow the Budget to be changed.
