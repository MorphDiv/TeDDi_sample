KDE
Systemsettings
file manager
In these modules, you can configure various aspects of & konqueror; 's file manager functionality.
& konqueror; 's web browser functionality has its own configuration modules.
Misc Options
Open folders in separate windows
If this option is checked, a new & konqueror; window will be created when you open a folder, rather than simply showing that folder's contents in the current window.
Show'Delete 'context menu entries which bypass the trashcan
Check this if you want Delete menu commands to be displayed on the desktop and in the file manager's context menus. You can always delete files by holding the & Shift; key while calling Move to Trash.
The settings for & konqueror; 's file manager mode on the View Modes, Navigation, Services, General and Trash pages are used by & dolphin; as well.
KControl
Use
The configuration options for the file manager are organized under tabs as follows:
Appearance
This tab contains options for customizing the appearance of & konqueror; windows, such as the default font text color.
Behavior
This tab contains a couple of & konqueror; global options.
Previews
On this tab, you can customize when & konqueror; should show previews.
Appearance
The following settings determine how text and colors are displayed in & konqueror; File Manager mode windows.
Standard font:
This is the font used to display text such as file names in & konqueror; windows.
Font size:
Lets you control the size of text, while the Standard Font setting determines the font face used.
Normal text color:
Determines the standard text color.
Height for icon text:
The maximum number of lines that can be used to draw icon text. Long lines are truncated at the end of the last line.
You can still see word-wrapped filenames by pausing the mouse pointer over the icon.
Width for icon text:
The maximum width for the icon text when & konqueror; is in multi-column view mode.
Underline filenames:
When Underline filenames is checked, filenames will be underlined so that they look like links on a web page.
Display file sizes in bytes:
The final check box on this page determines how & konqueror; displays file sizes, when you are in one of the file manager modes that normally shows this information. If you check the Display file sizes in bytes box then file sizes are always shown in bytes. If you leave it unchecked then file sizes are shown in bytes, kilobytes or megabytes, depending on their size.
Behavior
Show network operations in a single window
If unchecked, and you download a file, a dialog box will appear that shows the status of the download.
Download Dialog Box
Download Dialog Box
Individual Download Dialog Box
If you start a new transfer, another dialog box will appear. (Netscape; users will be familiar with this behavior)
If checked, all transfer status windows will be grouped together under a single dialog box.
Collected Download Dialog Box
If you choose to use the Collected download dialog box, you can delete transfers by clicking once on the transfer you want to cancel, then clicking the Delete Button on the left.
Show file tips
Here you can control if, when moving the mouse over a file, you want to see a small popup window with additional information about that file.
Show previews in file tips
Here you can control if the file tip should show a thumbnail preview of the file.
Home URL
This is the & URL; (eg; a folder or a web page) where & konqueror; will jump to when the Home button is pressed.
The default is the users home folder, indicated with a ~.
You can set a path that is your Home URL by typing into the text field, or using the browse icon. The default is ~ which is a standard shortcut for your $HOME folder. When you choose the home icon on your panel, in a file open or save dialog, or from within & konqueror; in file manager mode, this is the folder you will be shown.
The Ask confirmation for setting tells & konqueror; what to do when you choose to Delete, Trash, or Shred a file in a & konqueror; window. If any box is checked, & konqueror; asks for confirmation before performing the corresponding action.
Previews
& konqueror; has a preview feature for many file types, including HTML files, images, & PostScript; and PDF, sound, web archives (if you have the appropriate & konqueror; plugin installed) and text files.
If you enable previews for one of these, files of that particular file type will not be represented by standard icons in the filemanager, but will instead be shown as miniature previews. On slow computers, the previews can take some time to show up, so you might not want to enable this feature.
In this module you can specify which protocols you wish the previews to be available for. Creating the previews requires that & konqueror; download at least part of the file, in order to create the preview. & konqueror;, like the rest of & kde; is entirely network transparent, and will treat a remote & FTP; folder just as if it was on your local hard drive. This can result in a delay, especially if you are viewing, for example, a folder full of images over a slow network connection.
For each protocol, you can independently enable or disable previews. For example, you might enable previews for NFS mounted drives if you have a fast network, but disable them for & FTP; because your Internet connection is via a modem.
You can further refine the maximum size file that & konqueror; will attempt to show a preview for. The default is 1 MB. In other words, by default, if a file is 900 kB in size, and the protocol you are viewing the folder with is enabled, then & konqueror; will create a preview icon for it. If the file is 1.1 MB in size, & konqueror; will not make a preview, even if the protocol is enabled.
You can turn on and off previews on the fly from within & konqueror;, using the View menu. For example, if you normally want to see image previews on every protocol, but find a particular server is very slow to send you the data, you might turn it off for the present, and turn it on again later.
You may also like to enable the checkbox Increase size of previews relative to icons, in order to see more information in the thumbnails.
Many image files already contain a thumbnail. You can enable the Use thumbnails embedded in files to make use of these. This will save time waiting for thumbnails to be created when viewing a folder full of images you have not previously seen in & konqueror;.
