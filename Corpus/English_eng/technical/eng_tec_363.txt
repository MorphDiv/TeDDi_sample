Chart Type X-Y (Scatter)
Chart Wizard
you can choose a chart type.
X-Y (Scatter)
An X-Y chart in its basic form is based on one data series consisting of a name, a list of x‑values, and a list of y‑values.
Each value pair (x|y) is shown as a point in a coordinate system.
The name of the data series is associated with the y‑values and shown in the legend.
Choose an X-Y chart for the following example tasks:
scale the x‑axis
generate a parameter curve, for example a spiral
draw the graph of a function
explore the statistical association of quantitative variables
Your X-Y chart may have more than one data series.
X-Y Chart Variants
Chart Wizard
, or by choosing
Format - Chart Type
for a chart in edit mode.
Line
tab page of the data series properties dialogue box.
Data Series
dialogue box.
In this dialogue box, you can change many properties of the data series.
Insert - y-Error Bars
to enable the display of error bars.
You can enable the display of mean value lines and trend lines using commands on the Insert menu.
Points only
Tools - Options - Charts - Default Colours
.
Lines Only
This variant draws straight lines from one data point to the next.
The data points are not shown by icons.
Sort by x-values
to draw the lines in the order of the x-values.
This sorting applies only to the chart, not to the data in the table.
Points and Lines
This variant shows points and lines at the same time.
3-D Lines
3-D View
to set properties like illumination and angle of view.
Smooth Lines
Smooth Lines
to draw curves instead of straight line segments.
Properties
to set details for the curves.
Cubic Spline
interpolates your data points with polynomials of degree 3.
The transitions between the polynomial pieces are smooth, having the same slope and curvature.
Resolution
determines how many line segments are calculated to draw a piece of polynomial between two data points.
You can see the intermediate points if you click any data point.
B-Spline
uses the data points as control points to form a B-spline curve.
Those curves are built piecewise from polynomials.
The
Data points order
sets the degree k of these polynomials.
