Considerations When Building
It is reasonable that you would want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. To this end, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script to control this setup. To get a complete listing of these options, type. / configure --help. These are straight forward and will not be covered here.
If you are having trouble with & quantaplus; running properly, you should check your path to ensure that the & kde; 3 bin folder is in there. Also, be sure that you do not have any older versions of & kde; laying about that appear in PATH before your & kde; 3 bin folder. The same holds true for & Qt;.
