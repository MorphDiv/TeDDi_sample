Seahorse is a GNOME application for managing encryption keys. It also integrates with nautilus, gedit and other places for encryption operations.
With seahorse you can create and manage PGP keys, create and manage SSH keys, publish and retrieve keys from key servers, cache your passphrase so you don't have to keep typing it and backup your keys and keyring.

Passphrase for New PGP Key
Enter the passphrase for your new key twice.
When creating a key we need to generate a lot of
random data and we need you to help. It's a good
idea to perform some other action like typing on
the keyboard, moving the mouse, using applications.
This gives the system the random data that it needs.
