Getting & kde;
Where do I get & kde;?
The main distribution site for & kde; is ftp. kde. org. However, this site is often under heavy load, so you might prefer to use download. kde. org which automatically redirects you to the mirror nearest to you. You can also have a look at the list of & kde; mirror sites.
Are there & Linux; distributions that include & kde;?
Yes, major & Linux; distributions already ship & kde;. As building a distribution takes some time, they might not always contain the latest version, but for a start or to avoid downloading from the Internet, they do provide a good starting point.
You can find an up-to-date list of distributions that ship with & kde; here.
What is the current version?
Currently, the latest stable version is 4.2.1
The kde; 4.2.1 Info Page contains a lot of information specific to this release.
Where do I find & kde; snapshots?
You can get the latest snapshots from ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde/ unstable/ snapshots. You might also want to consider setting up your own SVN client in order to maintain the latest snapshot at all times. Please refer to Anonymous SVN and & kde; for further information.
Where do I get & Qt;?
& Qt; is a product of the Norwegian company Trolltech. You can always get the latest & Qt; version from their FTP; server.
And with most up-to-date & Linux; distributions, & Qt; is already included. Please see for the version of & Qt; you need.
