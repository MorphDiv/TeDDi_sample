(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a complete result information in a multi-dimenasional array on success and FALSE on error.
ldap_get_entries() function is used to simplify reading multiple entries from the result, specified with result_identifier, and then reading the attributes and multiple values.
The entire information is returned by one function call in a multi-dimensional array.
The structure of the array is as follows.
The attribute index is converted to lowercase. (Attributes are case-insensitive for directory servers, but not when used as array indices.)
return_value[ "count"] = number of entries in the result return_value[0]: refers to the details of first entry return_value[i]["dn"] = DN of the ith entry in the result return_value[i]["count"] = number of attributes in ith entry return_value[i][j] = jth attribute in the ith entry in the result return_value[i]["attribute"]["count"] = number of values for attribute in ith entry return_value[i]["attribute"][j] = jth value of attribute in ith entry
