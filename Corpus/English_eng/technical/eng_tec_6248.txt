Description
& kmousetool; clicks the mouse whenever the mouse cursor pauses briefly. It was designed to help those with repetitive strain injuries, for whom pressing buttons hurts.
& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a specified time for a drag to begin, before unclicking the mouse. This way, you can use it for drag and drop operations as well.
