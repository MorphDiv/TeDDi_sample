This & systemsettings; module allows you to configure the sound and video device preference and the backends used by Phonon.
Device Preference tab
On the left you are presented a tree list with various categories of outputs and capture. For each category you may choose what device you wish to use.
The Audio Output and Audio Capture items define the default ordering of devices which can be overridden by each sub items.
Clicking the Apply Device List To button shows a dialog which enables you to copy the selected setting from one category to many others.
Highlight a category and the available devices for this category are displayed in the list on the right. The order in this list determines the preference of the output and capture devices. If for some reason the first device cannot be used Phonon will try to use the second, & etc;
Use the Prefer and Defer buttons to change the order and the Test button to play a test sound on the selected device.
Backend tab
On the left side of this module a list of Phonon backends found on your system is shown. The order here determines the order Phonon will use the backends. Use the Prefer and Defer buttons to change this order.
Depending on the selected backend additional settings might be enabled like & eg; Deinterlacing (Media and method) for Xine.
