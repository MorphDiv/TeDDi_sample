Rehearse Timings of Slide Changes
$[officename] assists you in defining the right rehearse timings for automatic slide changes.
Prepare the slides, start the show using a special icon, tell your imaginary audience what you want to tell for the first slide, then advance to the next slide and so on. $[officename] records the display time for each slide, so the next time you play the show with automatic slide changes, the timing will be as recorded.
