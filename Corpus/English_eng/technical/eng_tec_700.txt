icon to keep the wizard from starting automatically.
The wizards for combo boxes and list boxes differ from each other in their final step.
This is because the nature of control fields:
List Boxes
In the case of a list box, the user selects one entry from a list of entries.
These entries are saved in a database table and cannot be modified through the list box.
List Box Wizard
allows two tables of a database to be linked, so that the control field can display a detailed list of a database field that is located in a different table from the one to which the form refers.
In the other tables the required field is searched for by using the field names (ControlSource) and then the fields will be completed accordingly.
If the field name is not found, the list will remain empty.
When list fields contain linked columns, the first column of the other table will be used without a query being shown first.

Combo Boxes
In the case of combo boxes, users can select one entry from the list entries or enter text themselves.
The entries, which are offered as a list from which users can select, may originate from any database table.
The entries that users select or enter so that they can be saved can be saved either in the form only, or in a database.
If they are saved in a database, they will be written to the database table on which the form is based.

Combo Box Wizard
has the
Data Processing
page as the last page, whereas in the case of list boxes this page does not exist.
Here you can enter whether and where text that has been entered is to be saved in the values table.
