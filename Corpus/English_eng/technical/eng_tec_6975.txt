Overview

Original image
Filter
The Wind filter can be used to create motion blur, but it can also be used as a general distort filter. What is characteristic about this filter is that it will render thin black or white lines. Wind will detect the edges in the image, and stretch out thin white or black lines from that edge. This is why you can create the illusion of motion, because the edges are what will be blurred in a photograph of a moving object.
Activating the filter
You can find this filter through
Options

The interface is quite simple. You can set the
You can only set the wind in two directions, either Left or Right. However, you can control which edge the wind will come from using the values Leading, Trailing or Both. Because Trailing will produce a black wind, it creates a less convincing motion blur than Leading, which will produce white wind.
The following illustrations are based on this image:

Leading
Trails will start from the front border, falling on the object itself. It suggests that a violent wind is pulling color out.
Trailing
Trails start from the back border of the object.
Both

Threshold
The threshold to detect borders. The higher it is, the fewer borders will be detected.
Strength
Higher values increase the strength of the effect.

Value Propagate
Example for the Value Propagate filter
Filter
This filter works on color borders. It spreads pixels that differ in a specified way from their neighbouring pixels.
This filter is found in the image window menu under

The result of your settings will appear in the Preview without affecting the image until you click on
The examples will be about the following image:
More white (larger value)
Pixels will be propagated from upper value pixels towards lower value pixels. So bright areas will enlarge.
More white
Bright pixels have been propagated to dark pixels in the four directions : top, bottom, right and left. Filter applied several times to increase effect.
More black (smaller value)
Pixels will be propagated from lower value pixels towards upper value pixels. So dark areas will enlarge.
More black
To bottom only
The same as above with
Middle value to peaks
On a border between the selected thresholds, the average of both values is propagated.
A thin border with a transitional color has been added to objects. It is not visible around objects with smoothed borders.
Green area zoomed x800. A thin border (one pixel wide) has been added. Its value is the average between grey (90%) and green (78%) : (90 + 78) / 2 = 84.
Foreground to peaks
The propagated areas will be filled with the foreground color of the toolbox.
In this example, the foreground color in Toolbox is Red. A thin border, one pixel wide, red, is added around objects. With smoothed objects, this border is located at the furthest limit of smoothing. Here, another border appears inside. This is an artifact due to the small size of the object which makes the smoothing area of opposite sides to overlap.
Only foreground
Only areas with the Toolbox Foreground color will propagate.
In this example, the foreground color in Toolbox is that of the green object. After applying filter several times, the green area is clearly enlarged.
Only background
Only areas with the Background color will propagate.
More opaque

These commands work like
Original layer, with a transparent background.

Applying example for the Newsprint filter
Filter
This filter halftones the image using a clustered-dot dither. Halftoning is the process of rendering an image with multiple levels of grey or color (i.e. a continuous tone image) on a device with fewer tones; often a bi-level device such as a printer or typesetter.
The basic premise is to trade off resolution for greater apparent tone depth (this is known as spatial dithering).
There are many approaches to this, the simplest of which is to throw away the low-order bits of tone information; this is what the posterize filter does. Unfortunately, the results don't look too good. However, no spatial resolution is lost.
This filter uses a clustered-dot ordered dither, which reduces the resolution of the image by converting cells into spots which grow or shrink according to the intensity that cell needs to represent.
Imagine a grid super-imposed on the original image. The image is divided into cells by the grid - each cell will ultimately hold a single spot made up of multiple output pixels in order to approximate the darkness of the original image in that cell.
Obviously, a large cell size results in a heavy loss in resolution! The spots in the cells typically start off as circles, and grow to be diamond shaped. This change in shape is controlled by a

Proper halftoning does not need antialiasing: the aim is to reduce the color depth after all! However, since this plugin is mainly for special effects, the results are displayed on screen rather than by a black/white printer. So it is often useful to apply a little anti-aliasing to simulate ink smearing on paper. If you do want to print the resulting image then set the antialising to 1 (ie, off).
Oversample
Number of subpixels to sample to produce each output pixel. Set to 1 to disable this feature. Warning: large numbers here will lead to very long filter runtimes!

Light direction
By default light comes from the upper left corner (135Â°). You can change this direction from 0 to 360 (counter clockwise).
Color variation
Each tile has only one color. So the number of colors is reduced, compared to the original image. Here you can increase the number of colors a little.

Color averaging
When this option is unchecked, the image drawing can be recognized inside tiles. When checked, the colors inside tiles are averaged into a single color.
Allow tile splitting
This option splits tiles in areas with many colors, and so allows a better color gradation and more details in these areas.

FG/BG lighting
When this option is checked, tiles are lit by the foreground color of the toolbox, and shadow is colored by the background color. Joins have the background color.

IWarp
Applying example for the IWarp filter
Filter
This filter allows you to deform interactively some parts of the image and, thanks to its Animate option, to create the elements of a fade in/fade out animation between the original image and the deformed one, that you can play and use in a Web page.
To use it, first select a deform type then click on the Preview and drag the mouse pointer.
You can find this filter through
The options of this filter are so numerous that they come in two tabs. The first tab contains general options. The second tab holds animation options.
Settings

The Settings tab allows you to set parameters which will affect the preview you are working on. So, you can apply different deform modes to different parts of the preview.
Here, the Preview is your work space: You click on the Preview and drag mouse pointer. The underlying part of image will be deformed according to the settings you have chosen. If your work is not convenient, press the
Deform Mode
Move
Allows you to
Remove
This remove the distortion where you drag the mouse pointer, partially or completely. This allows you to avoid pressing Reset button, working on the whole image. Be careful when working on an animation: this option will affect one frame only.
Grow
This option inflates the pointed pattern.
Shrink
Self explanatory.
Swirl CCW
Create a vortex counter clockwise.
Swirl CW
Create a vortex clockwise.
Deform radius
Defines the radius, in pixels (5-100), of the filter action circle around the pixel pointed by the mouse.
Deform amount
Sets how much out of shape your image will be put (0.0-1.0).
Bilinear
This option smooths the IWarp effect.
Adaptive supersample
This option renders a better image at the cost of increased calculation.
Max Depth
This value limits the maximum sampling iterations performed on each pixel.
When the value difference between a pixel and the adjacent ones exceeds this threshold a new sampling iteration is performed on the pixel.
Animate

This tab allows to generate several intermediate images between the original image and the final deformation of this image. You can play this animation thanks to the
Number of frames
That's the number of images in your animation (2-100). These frames are stored as layers attached to your image. Use the XCF format when saving it.
Reverse
This option plays the animation backwards.
Ping pong
When the animation ends one way, it goes backwards.
