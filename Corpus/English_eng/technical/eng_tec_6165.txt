URL
Element to Show
Geometry
The Webslice Widget allows you to display a part of a webpage on your desktop or in a panel. The webslice is fully interactive. Specify the URL of the webpage in the URL field. In the Element to Show field, fill in a CSS identifier (for example #mybox for elements with the id "mybox"). This is the preferred method as it works best with layout changes on the webpage. Alternatively, you can specify a rectangle on the webpage to use as slice. Use "x, y, width, height" in pixels, for example "100,80,300,360". This method is a fallback for webpages that do not provide enough semantic markup for the above mechanism. If both methods (element and geometry) are used, the element will take precedence.
