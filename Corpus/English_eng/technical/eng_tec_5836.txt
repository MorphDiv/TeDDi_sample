Introduction
& kppp; is a dialer and front end for pppd. It allows for interactive script generation and network setup. It will automate the dialing in process to your ISP while letting you conveniently monitor the entire process.
Once connected & kppp; will provide a rich set of statistics and keep track of the time spent online for you.
A built-in terminal and script generator will enable you to set up your connection with ease. You will no longer need an additional terminal program such as seyon or minicom to test and setup your connection.
& kppp; features elaborate phone cost accounting, which enables you to easily track your online costs.
We hope you enjoy this dialer, and that it eases your way onto the internet.

& kppp; is derived from ezppp 0.6, by Jay Painter. However, nearly everything in & kppp; was rewritten so ezppp and & kppp; do not have much in common any longer.

The following sections contain some fairly generic information for several common operating systems which might run & kppp;. The following sites may be of interest for further information about the ppp protocol, pppd and networking in general:

The Network Administrators' Guide:
Preparing a & Linux; system for & PPP;
In order for & kppp; (or indeed, pppd) to work, your kernel must have ppp support compiled in. If this is not the case, get yourself the latest version of pppd from any of the popular & Linux; archives (such as, and recompile your kernel with ppp support enabled.
Do n't fret, since this sounds a lot scarier than it actually is. Do n't forget to install pppd afterwards.
If you're not sure if you have a kernel with ppp support, issue the dmesg at the command prompt and look for something like this:
& PPP;: version 2.3.0 (demand dialing) TCP compression code copyright 1989 Regents of the University of California & PPP; Dynamic channel allocation code copyright 1995 Caldera, Inc. & PPP; line discipline registered
& kppp; tries to find out for itself if your kernel supports & PPP;. If not, you will be notified as soon as & kppp; starts up.
For & Linux; 2. x kernels, the pppd daemon should be version 2.3 or greater. You can find out what version your system has, by issuing the command pppd --version on the command line. None of the pppd daemons actually have a --version, but putting the option in will cause the pppd daemon to issue an error message, and then to print out a list of options and other information, which includes the version of the ppd daemon.
