A Step-By-Step Tutorial
In this chapter, & kpresenter; is introduced using a simple tutorial. We shall walk through the most basic steps that are involved in creating a presentation, and adding some basic effects.
Start a new document
When you start & kpresenter;, the usual & koffice; startup dialog appears.
The koffice; startup dialog
The & koffice; startup dialog
Select Screen on the left then select the template labeled Title (highlighted in blue in the screenshot above) by clicking on it. You can check Always use this template to make it the default template.
Now click Use This Template. This brings up the slide editor window, where you can view and edit the slides (and objects contained in them) in your document. At the moment, we just have one slide, with one object on it, which is a text box.

Insert a picture
Let's go back to the first slide now. Use the list of slides on the left of your screen.
In this section, we'll liven our presentation up a bit by adding a nice logo to the title page. To do so, the first step is to click on the Insert menu item, and then on Picture....
Using the menu to add an image
Using the menu to add an image
This brings up a file selection dialog. To learn about this or other standard & kde; dialog boxes in detail, please consult the & kde; documentation. You can browse by clicking on folder icons or by using the browser style buttons on the toolbar (highlighted in red.) Clicking the up arrow takes you up one folder level.
Find the file named koffice-logo. png, which may be in a different folder than the one shown in the screenshot below. You can also choose any other graphic file if you like! Select the file, and click OK.
Choosing a picture to add
Choosing a picture to add
Click with the & LMB; where you want to place the loge in it's original size or draw a rectangle with the left mouse (click the & LMB; and keep the button pressed) to specify the position and size for the logo. There are selection handles (little squares) visible around the border of the graphic.
The newly added image

Place the mouse cursor anywhere in the middle of the logo, and drag it to the middle of the title page. Then use the selection handles to resize it correctly.

That's it. Now you have a picture on the title page!
Insert a & koffice; object
Let's insert another & koffice; object under the picture, for example a chart.
Every & koffice; supported document can be embedded in a & kpresenter; slide. Let's choose a chart from & kchart;. To do so, the first step is to click on the Insert menu item, and then on Object.
The Insert Object menu
The Insert Object menu
A list of the & koffice; available components appears as submenu. Select Chart and then outline with your mouse the area you want to put your chart in on the & kpresenter; slide.

Once you release the mouse button, a blank chart is added on the slide. Whenever you work in the chart, the toolbars and menubar in & kpresenter; main window are replaced by those from & kchart;.

While you are in the chart, clicking with the & RMB; will bring the & kchart; settings menu which allows you to modify the parameters of the chart. Please see the & kchart; user manual to get more information on how to use & kchart;.
Click anywhere with the & LMB; outside the chart to go back to & kpresenter; slide.
A single click on the chart will allow you to drag it to change its location and also to drag the borders to make it bigger as with any other & kpresenter; object. Double click on the chart to get into & kchart; mode and modify any of the chart property.
Add a shadow to the title text
Let's continue enhancing our title page by adding a shadow behind the title. Right click anywhere on the title text. This achieves two things: the text box containing the title is selected, and a menu pops up.
Select the Shadow Objects... option in the popup menu.
The context menu

The Shadow dialog pops up. The distance between the shadow and the text is currently 0 so the shadow cannot be seen (this part of the dialog box is highlighted in red.)

Increase the distance value to 3. The effect of changing the distance can be seen in the preview window. Now click OK.

Open the Select Color dialog by clicking on the dark blue A icon on the right side of the Text toolbar (this icon has a Color... tooltip) or choose the Text menu and then click on Color... and change the color to blue.
