CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs
4.2 Indications for use
Treatment and prevention of flea infestation (Ctenocephalides canis and C. felis) in dogs.
Insecticidal efficacy duration against new infestations with fleas persists for a minimum of 4 weeks.
The veterinary medicinal product can be used as part of a treatment strategy for the control of Flea Allergy Dermatitis (FAD).
Treatment and prevention of tick infestation (Ixodes ricinus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Ixodes scapularis, Dermacentor reticulatus, Dermacentor variabilis, Amblyomma americanum) in dogs.
The veterinary medicinal product has persistent acaricidal efficacy duration of 4 weeks against ticks.
2 4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in dogs less than 8 weeks of age or with a body weight of less than 2 kg.
Do not use in case of known hypersensitivity to phenylpyrazole class compounds or any of the excipients.
Do not use on sick (e. g. systemic diseases, fever) or convalescent animals.
This product is specifically developed for dogs.
Do no use in cats, as this could lead to overdosing.
Do not use on rabbits.
4.4 Special warnings
This veterinary medicinal product is for the treatment of ticks and adult fleas.
All dogs in a household should be treated.
In cases of heavy infestation prior to treatment, the dog’ s surrounding should be vacuumed and treated with a suitable insecticide.
Dogs should not be bathed or shampooed from 48 hours before treatment.
Immersion of the animal in water or shampooing within 24 hours after treatment may reduce the efficacy of the veterinary medicinal product.
However, weekly immersion in water did not affect efficacy against fleas and ticks.
4.5 Special precautions for use
i) Special precautions for use in animals
This veterinary medicinal product is for spot-on application only.
Do not administer orally or via any other route.
Care should be taken to avoid contact of the veterinary medicinal product with the eyes of the animal.
It is important to apply the dose to an area where the dog cannot lick it off and to make sure that animals do not lick each other following treatment.
Following treatment, ticks will detach from the host within 24 to 48 hours after infestation; however, single ticks might remain on the animal.
For this reason, a transmission of infectious diseases by ticks cannot be completely excluded.
ii) Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the medicinal product to animals
As a precautionary measure, direct contact with the treated animals should be avoided and children should not be allowed to play with treated animals until the application site is dry.
It is therefore recommended to treat animals in the evening.
Recently treated animals should not be allowed to sleep in the same bed as their owners, especially children.
People with known hypersensitivity to the phenylpyrazole class compounds or any of the excipients should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
Avoid skin contact with the pipette content.
Wash hands or other exposed body parts after use with soap and water.
If accidental eye exposure occurs, the eyes should be rinsed carefully with water.
Do not smoke, eat or drink during application.
3 iii) Other precautions
Care should be taken to avoid excessive wetting of the hair with the product since this will cause a clogged appearance of hair at the treatment spot.
However, should this occur, it will disappear within 24 hours post application.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
The following local reactions may be observed at the application site: fur discoloration, local alopecia or pruritus.
Local cosmetic effects at the application site, such as a greasy appearance or clumpiness of hair are common.
However, those signs disappear within 24 hours of the application.
A brief period of hypersalivation may occur if the animal licks the application site immediately after treatment.
This is not a sign of intoxication and disappears within minutes without treatment.
Correct application will minimise licking of the application site.
4.7 Use during pregnancy and lactation
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation, nor in breeding animals, although in laboratory animal studies no indications of relevant effects on reproduction or fetal development were observed.
Use only accordingly to the benefit/ risk assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
None known.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route

4 Tick treatment and prevention
Pyriprole kills ticks within 48 hours post-exposure.
One application has acaricidal efficacy duration of 4 weeks.
Method of administration
For external use only.
Remove one pipette from the package.
Hold it in an upright position.
Tap the narrow part of the pipette to ensure the contents remain within the main body of it.
Break the top of the snap-off top along the scored line.
Part the coat on the back of the animal between the shoulder blades until the skin is visible.
Place the tip of the pipette on the skin and squeeze it gently several times at one or two spots to empty the contents onto the skin.
Apply the 5 ml pipette to 2-3 spots down the backline of large dogs in order to prevent run-off.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes)
Mild neurological signs such as slight incoordination and unsteadiness were observed in some animals treated once a month at three times the recommended maximum dose for six consecutive months.
Those signs disappeared within 3 hours following administration.
In one out of 8 dogs repeatedly treated with five times the recommended dose, the following transient adverse effects were observed: tremors, ataxia, panting and convulsions.
These signs disappeared within 18 hours following administration.
Following an overdose of 10 times the maximum dose on a single occasion the following adverse effects were seen: vomiting, anorexia, reduced body weight, muscle tremors, seizures, unsteadiness, laboured breathing.
All signs resolved within 48 hours, with the exception of the loss of appetite.
An overdose of the veterinary medicinal product will cause a clogged appearance of hair at the treatment spot for up to 24 hours.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Not applicable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Ectoparasiticides for topical use; ATCvet code:
QP53AX26
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
The veterinary medicinal product is an insecticidal and acaricidal solution for spot-on use, containing pyriprole as active ingredient.
Pyriprole is an insecticide and acaricide belonging to the phenylpyrazole class.
It acts by interacting with ligand-gated chloride channels, in particular those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby blocking pre- and post-synaptic transfer of chloride ions across cell membranes.
This results in uncontrolled activity of the central nervous system and death of fleas and ticks.
In dogs, adverse reactions are associated with neurological signs caused by metabolites of the active substance.
5 Parasites are killed through contact rather than by systemic exposure.
Pyriprole kills fleas within 24 hours and ticks (Ixodes ricinus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Dermacentor reticulatus, Ixodes scapularis, Dermacentor variabilis, Amblyomma americanum) within 48 hours post-exposure.
Adult fleas are killed before they lay eggs for a minimum of 4 weeks after treatment.
Since Prac-tic completely eliminates egg production, it breaks the flea life cycle.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
In dogs, after topical administration pyriprole is slowly absorbed by skin, leading to a systemic exposure by its two main metabolites.
Following topical administration pyriprole is rapidly distributed in the hair coat of dogs within one day after application.
It can be found in the hair coat throughout the treatment interval.
Environmental properties
Pyriprole may be harmful to aquatic organisms.

Break the top of the snap-off top along the scored line.
Part the coat on the back of the animal between the shoulder blades until the skin is visible.
