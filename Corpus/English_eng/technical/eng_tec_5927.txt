Calendar Tool
Insert
Start date:
End date:
End date is before start date! Please make sure that end date comes after start date.
Error
Calendars should not be longer than 10 years. If you really need such long periods you need to split them up.
Start and end dates are equal! Only one day will be inserted, do you want to continue?
Warning
Creating a calendar for a longer period than a year can take up a lot of space, do you want to continue?
The area where the calendar is inserted is NOT empty, are you sure you want to continue, overwriting existing data? If you choose No the area that would be required for the desired calendar will be selected so you can see what data would be overwritten.
