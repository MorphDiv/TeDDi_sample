Compounding Term
Present _Value:
Periodic Interest _Rate:
Calculates the number of compounding periods necessary to increase an investment of present value to a future value, at a fixed interest rate per compounding period.
_Future Value:
C_alculate
Double-Declining Depreciation
Calculates the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified period of time, using the double-declining balance method.
C_ost:
_Life:
_Period:
Future Value
Calculates the future value of an investment based on a series of equal payments at a periodic interest rate over the number of payment periods in the term.
_Periodic Payment:
_Number Of Periods:
Gross Profit Margin
Calculates the resale price of a product, based on the product cost and the wanted gross profit margin.
_Margin:
Periodic Payment
Calculates the amount of the periodic payment of a loan, where payments are made at the end of each payment period.
_Principal:
_Term:
Present Value
Calculates the present value of an investment based on a series of equal payments discounted at a periodic interest rate over the number of payment periods in the term.
Periodic Interest Rate
Calculates the periodic interest necessary to increase an investment to a future value, over the number of compounding periods.
Straight-Line Depreciation
_Cost:
_Salvage:
Calculates the straight-line depreciation of an asset for one period. The straight-line method of depreciation divides the depreciable cost evenly over the useful life of an asset. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Sum-Of-The-Years'-Digits Depreciation
Calculates the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified period of time, using the Sum-Of-The-Years'-Digits method. This method of depreciation accelerates the rate of depreciation, so that more depreciation expense occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Payment Period
Future _Value:
Calculates the number of payment periods that are necessary during the term of an ordinary annuity, to accumulate a future value, at a periodic interest rate.
