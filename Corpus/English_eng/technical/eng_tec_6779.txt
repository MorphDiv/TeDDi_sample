Unable to construct a GUI element. Your KMLDonkey installation is incomplete.
Unable to construct a requested GUI element. This is most likely because the GUI specification data file (kmldonkeyui. rc) has been installed in the wrong location, or has not been installed at all. If you installed KMLDonkey from a binary package, please report this to the packager at once. If you installed from source, check that you configured KMLDonkey to use the same install prefix as your KDE installation (see the README file accompanying the KMLDonkey source for details), and that your system does not keep KDE files in non-standard locations (Mandriva Linux systems, in particular, are known to do this).

Text & encoding:
The character set to use to decode the strings sent by the core.
Although MLDonkey does not understand about character encodings, you may well encounter text on the Donkey network that has been encoded in various national character sets. While you should, in general, use the ISO 8859-1 encoding - the de-facto network standard - you can choose a different character encoding here if you expect most of the text you encounter to be encoded in a certain national character set. Note: Changing this causes KMLDonkey to reconnect to the core. Changing it to something incompatible with the ISO 8859-1 character set may cause unpredictable behavior.
