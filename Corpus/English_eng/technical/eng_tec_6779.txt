Introduction
Conduit's goals are to synchronize your data as seamlessly as possible, be it from remote device or remote websites. It is about extending your life as you see it needs to be, no longer constrained by data, devices or formats. Conduit enables you to take your data where you want when you want. All of your mobile devices could be synchronized automatically by Conduit. Home file back-ups to a remote server? Synced automatically.
It may sometimes seem that Conduit is overly complicated, one of the design goals has always been to make the interface as simple and intuitive as possible. However Conduit is much more powerful then the simplistic design may lead on. This documentation will describe all the configuration options for groups and data providers, while the following gives some examples of items you may wish to synchronize;
A


Directories (important files)
Photos
Bookmarks (web and feeds)
Music



The user might also use one of the many popular online services including
A second laptop, also running GNOME
A mobile phone

Its hard enough keeping your information organized when limited to the desktop, let alone the added burden of keeping your information in sync with any of the other services or devices listed above.
Our goal for Conduit is to allow GNOME users to keep their information in sync. Irrespective of the type, irrespective of the way in which that information is stored. Conduit should just work.
Understanding the Conduit Interface
Conduit has a few basic concepts worth understanding before you begin. Knowing these concepts will help you discover things that you never knew you could keep in sync, for example, uploading photos right from your mobile phone to Picasa!
Conduit GUI
The Parts of the Conduit GUI

The file, edit and help menus store operations which apply to all groups. For more information on the contents of these menus, see below.
The Menu
Located on the left hand side of the window, lists all of the data providers that are detected and ready for use on your system.
Data providers are the source or destination of data you wish to sync. Please refer to the
The Data Provider Pane
Used to create groups of data providers to synchronize. Drag a data source to the left of the canvas pane and one or more data sinks to the right of the data pane to create a group. For more explanation on groups please check
The Canvas Pane
If you receive any conflict notifications while trying to run a sync job they will be listed here. For information on how to deal with possible conflicts please check the
The Conflicts Pane
The Menus
The File Menu



The Edit Menu


The Help Menu



The Preferences Window
The Conduit preferences is accessed from the Edit menu. Any setting or change that you make within the preferences menu affect all of your sync groups and basic Conduit operations.
Configuration Tab
The configuration tab is where all of Conduit's global settings are configured. There are six global settings:
Save Settings on Exit
Instructs Conduit that all configured dataproviders and groups should be saved when the application exits.
Show Status Icon
Shows a status icon in the notification area. This icon animates to indicate a sync is in progress.
Minimize to Notification Area
Instructs Conduit to minimize to the notification area instead of to the panel.
Use Built in Web Browser
When a data provider requires that you log onto a website, this option tells Conduit to use its own web browser to do so.
When an Item Has Been Deleted
Where There is a Two Way Conflict
Data Providers Tab
This tab shows a list of the data providers that are currently installed.
Data Conversions Tab
This tab lists the data conversions that Conduit is capable of performing.
Mapping DB
This is a list of the UID that Conduit uses to maintain accurate sync data from different sources. Here you have the option to clear the mapping database.
The Web Login Window
Sometimes you will be required to log into a website associated with certain data providers. The frequency at which you may have to log in is not determined by Conduit, but by the security policy of the respective data provider. For example, Box.net requires you to log in every time Conduit is run, whereas Flickr only requires you to log in once, to give permission to Conduit to upload photos. If you are required to log into a website, and you have selected the

Data Providers and Groups
Conduit represents the things your want to synchronize graphically. When data providers get added to the canvas, they get arranged into so called groups. A group is a collection of data providers that share data. In the figure below you will see the following parts
Conduit Depicts Synchronizations Graphically
Parts of a Synchronization Group
A data provider for synchronizing two way whose status indicates that it is ready to be synchronized.
A group containing two folder dataproviders. The arrow has two ends, indicating that the two dataproviders will undergo a two way synchronization, that is data will flow in both directions, and both folders will contain the same information once the sync finishes.
A second folder data provider. By convention, data providers that lie on the right side of groups are called data sinks. This is because during a one way sync, data can only flow into them.
A Facebook and Picasa data provider for uploading images to those sites. Notice that that the group has three data providers, and the arrow has changed to indicate that data will flow in only one direction, that is images will be uploaded from F-Spot to Facebook and Picasa.
Synchronizing Something
This section describes the steps required to synchronize two data providers. The example given illustrates how to synchronize two folders but the concepts are applicable to anything you wish to synchronize. If you need more information on specific settings please refer to the corresponding section of the documentation.

The top group depicts a two way synchronization of two folders
The bottom group depicts a one way sync of images, from F-Spot to Facebook, and to the Picasa web albums.
Example 1: Synchronizing Two Folders
The following steps will recreate the two way synchronization group shown as
On your desktop create three folders named folder1, folder2, and folder3. Drag a file of your choice into folder1.
Start Conduit
Add a data provider for
From the data provider pane, drag the folder data provider and drop it on the left hand side of the canvas pane. This will be the data source that we are going to sync from.
Configure
Configuring Folder 1
Double click on the data provider you recently dropped on the canvas. This will bring up the folder configuration window as shown below. Enter something memorable in the name field and change the
Add a data provider for
Drag another folder data provider from the pane on the left. This time drop it adjacent to the folder1 dataprovider. This should result in an arrow connecting it to folder1 being created.
Configure
Configure the data provider so that its
Configure the synchronization parameters
Right click on the associated group, and under sync options, select a two way sync. Since this is just a basic run through on how to setup a sync we are not going to go through any advanced syncing options in this section of the documentation. If you wish more information on the options available, please see
Synchronize the two folders by right clicking on them and selecting sync, or from the File menu. Once the sync is finished you should see the file that you placed in folder1 on your desktop within folder2.
Example 2: Exporting Images to Multiple Destinations
The second group shown in
Start F-Spot
Drag a F-Spot data provider from the data provider pane and drop it onto an empty spot on the canvas. A new group containing just the F-Spot data provider will be created.
Drag Facebook and Picasa data providers into the Group that was just created.
Configure the data providers by double clicking on them.
Now synchronize the group to upload photos. You will be prompted to log into Facebook using the Conduit login window, shown in
Summary
All sync operations work exactly like this. The only difference is the data you are syncing and the providers you are using. You always follow the same sequence of steps,
Add dataproviders to create a new group, or to an existing group.
Configure the data providers. Each data provider requires a unique configuration. For reference on these please the
Configure the group, selecting what should happen on conflict, etc.
Synchronize the dataproviders as you wish.
Network Synchronization
If you have two computers at home, Conduit can be used to synchronize the data between them, directly, without first having to store the data somewhere else first. The steps below will illustrate how to synchronize Tomboy notes on two computers, called nzjrs-desktop and nzjrs-laptop. The following key will be used to help explain the setup procedure.


Network Synchronization Tip
The process below, although describing Tomboy note synchronization, could be suitably modified to synchronize all sorts of data between two computers, including Contacts, Calendar information, and even F-Spot photos.
Configuration of the First Computer
On the first computer create a synchronization group connecting Tomboy to the Network dataprovider, which is listed in the Miscellaneous category in the dataprovider pane. This makes Tomboy available for synchronization on the second computer.
After a short delay, this will result in a new category being created on the second computer. The category will take the name of the first computer, nzjrs-desktop in my case, and it shall contain any dataproviders currently available for synchronization.
Configuration of the Second Computer
Still on the second computer, drag the Tomboy dataprovider from the newly created category onto the canvas. Notice how its name is Remote Tomboy, indicating it refers to data on the remote, or first, computer.
Finally, on the second computer, start the sync in the normal manner.
Your tomboy notes should now be synchronized between the two computers.
File Synchronization
Due to performance and security reasons, we do not recommend using the network sync feature to synchronize large files between two computers. We hope to address this limitation in the future.
