Configuring the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
The Work Breakdown Structure introduces numbering for all tasks in the project, according to the task structure. The tasks are numbered in a fashion that reflects the structure of the project. The WBS is defined as a tree structure.
The WBS
The WBS
You can configure the way you want the WBS to look in your project. To do so, you can use the Tools Define WBS Pattern... menu. This displays the WBS Definition Dialog.

Code
Default is Number but you can set the WBS code to be Roman Numbers or Letters, either upper case or lower case.
Separator
The default separator is a dot and can be set to anything else you want. The separator defines the way the tree will look. On the screenshot above, the separator is the dot.
Instead of having the same code for all levels (for example 3.2.1) you can define a different code for each level. For this you can check Use Levels and then you define each level code and separator.
For example if you want your tree to be 1: II-B you will set level 0 to Number and separator:, level 1 will be Roman upper case and separator - and level 2 will be Letter upper case.
This is illustrated on the next screenshot.

To set a new level, choose the level number in the box near the Add Level button then click the Add Level button. Then choose the Code for the level and the separator.

Add a level
To remove a level, choose the level number in the first column of the list and click on it. The level row is then highlighted and the level number changes to bold. Then click the Remove button. This is demonstrated on the screenshot with Level 2.

Generate WBS Code
The WBS code is auto-generated; simply choose Generate WBS Code from the Tools menu to generate the WBS code for the project.
After you changed the WBS definition you will want to generate the new WBS.
