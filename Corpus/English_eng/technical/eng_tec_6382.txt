File properties
Starting from & kplayer; 0.5 each file and URL has its own set of properties. They include information that & kplayer; found out about the file, like time length, video size, frame rate, bitrates, and so on, as well as various options you can set, like name, video aspect, subtitles, and many more.
Most properties can be set through the File Properties dialog. The Properties dialog for the currently loaded file or URL can be opened from the File menu, or using the Properties button on the main toolbar, or from the right click popup menu. You can also open the Properties dialog for an entry in the multimedia library by right clicking it and selecting Properties..., or by using the Properties... command on the Library menu.
An easier way to set file properties is by holding the & Shift; key when changing a setting. For example, if you hold & Shift; and select Soft Frame Dropping from the Player menu, & kplayer; will remember that setting for the current URL, and use it the next time you play it. After it is done playing the current URL, it will revert the Frame drop setting to the default, the one that was in effect before you changed it with & Shift;. On the other hand, if you change the Frame drop setting without holding & Shift;, the new setting will become the default, and will be used for all URL s that do not have it set explicitly.
Volume, contrast, brightness, hue and saturation are handled in a special way when it comes to file properties. Instead of remembering the exact setting when you hold & Shift;, & kplayer; will remember the setting relatively to the default.
For example, if you have a file that was recorded louder than your other files, when playing that file you can hold & Shift; and adjust the volume level to be the same as for other files. & kplayer; will remember this as something like lower the volume by 10 units when playing this file. If later you for example have a party and need to play your files louder than usual, you turn the volume up (without holding & Shift;), so all files play louder, then when the turn of that one file comes, & kplayer; will lower the volume by 10 units while playing it, so it again has the same volume level as the other files, and then turn the volume 10 units up when it moves to the next file.
Another example, you find a video that is dark and so needs to be played with higher brightness than other videos. So you hold the & Shift; key and drag the brightness slider up. & kplayer; remembers the higher brightness for this file, and then goes back to playing at normal brightness when you play another file. Suppose you did that at night, and next time you play the videos during daylight, so you want to play all of them at higher brightness. Then you drag the brightness slider up, this time without holding & Shift;, so the setting is made the default and applied to all videos that do not have a brightness property set. When the turn of the dark video comes, & kplayer; sees that it needs to be played at an even higher brightness and turns it further up, but only for the duration of that one video, and then restores it back to the default you set.
Choosing the Full Screen command or clicking the Maximize or Restore button in the title bar while holding & Shift; will set the Full screen property. Choosing an aspect command with & Shift; will set the Display size property to set aspect and the aspect you choose, and also will set the Maintain aspect property. A zooming command on the View menu when chosen with & Shift; will set the Display size property to set size and the fixed size, and so will resizing the window if you press & Shift; before you begin resizing the window.
This special function of the & Shift; key can be turned off on the Controls page in kplayer; Settings.
There are two special cases when you can also hold & Shift; to modify & kplayer; behavior. First, you can hold & Shift; when telling it to play a file or URL or dropping files onto & kplayer; window. & kplayer; will then load the first file or URL but will not start playing it. You can then open its File Properties and make your choices before starting to play it.
Second, if you hold & Shift; when choosing the Play command from the Player menu or clicking the Play button, & kplayer; will first stop the helper process that it runs once for each file to try and figure out the time length of the file. This is needed rarely if ever, only when the helper process causes any problems.
& kplayer; will remember properties for every file or URL that it opens, even those that are removed from the playlist, until the total number reaches the limit set on the General page in kplayer; Settings under Meta information cache size limit, by default 10000. After that it will start discarding the oldest entries. Playing an entry makes it the most recent entry in the cache. If you have very many files, you can set the cache size limit higher, but as some point it may start affecting & kplayer; performance.
Following are the available file properties, listed by pages in the File Properties dialog.
General properties
Name
This is the name that & kplayer; will display for this file or URL in the multimedia library, on the current playlist and also in the title bar when the file is loaded. Changing this property will not change the actual file system name of the file.
Path or URL
The file system path to the file or the URL of the file or stream. This property is read only. To use a different path or URL, open it with the Play... or Play URL... command on the File menu, or by dragging and dropping it onto & kplayer; window, or starting & kplayer; with URL argument(s), for example by launching files from & konqueror; File Manager or clicking a link in & konqueror; Web Browser.
Type
The type of the item. For a device, track, title or channel it is the device type. For other items it is the MIME type if known.
Frequency
The frequency in MHz of a DVB, PVR or TV channel. For other items this property is not applicable and not shown.
Playlist
& mplayer; currently is not smart enough to automatically detect and play a playlist file like pls or m3u, so & kplayer; has to explicitly tell it to parse a file as a playlist. The auto setting lets & kplayer; use the file extension to guess if it is a playlist file. The playlist extensions & kplayer; recognizes are ram, rpm, smi, smil, asx, m3u, pls and strm. If a file that is not a playlist has one of these extensions, or a playlist file has a different extension, you will need to correctly set this property in order to be able to play the file or stream.
Length
The time length of the file. & kplayer; tries to detect it with precision of one tenth of a second, and usually gets it pretty close to the real length. This property is read only.
Channels
The list of channels available on a TV or PVR device. & kplayer; chooses the default channel list based on the country setting in & kcontrolcenter;, or Western Europe if that is not set. You can change the channel list here. Not applicable to other items.
Driver
Input driver for a TV or PVR device. By default this is set to Video4Linux 2, but if your driver only supports the old Video4Linux interface, like for example the gspcav1 driver, select Video4Linux from this list. Not applicable to other items.
Channel file
A DVB device needs a file listing the available channels and their properties. & kplayer; looks for a file having channels. conf as part of its name in ~/. mplayer, / etc/ mplayer and / usr/ local/ etc/ mplayer and uses the first matching file it finds. You can change the channel file path here. If you do n't have a channel file, you can generate it using the scan utility that comes with DVB drivers.
Size properties
Resolution, Original size and Current size
Resolution of the video is adjusted to the correct aspect ratio to get the original video size, which is then adjusted to get the current size by taking into account any filters applied to the video. These properties are empty for audio only files, and they are read only, but see the next property.
Display size
Here you can set the initial video size & kplayer; will use when it starts playing the file, unless you turned off the option to Resize main window automatically on the General page in kplayer; Settings. The default setting will use the Minimum initial video width option from the General page in kplayer; Settings. The set size setting will use the fixed initial size you specify. The set aspect setting will again use the Minimum initial video width option, but will apply the fixed initial aspect you specify.
Full screen
Normally you would leave this at the default setting, which will keep the full screen state of the previous file. The yes setting will force full screen mode unless this is an audio only file, and the no setting will force the normal windowed mode.
Maximized
When the file is not played full screen, the yes setting for this option will force maximized window mode, and the no setting will force normal window mode. The default setting will keep the window state of the previous file.
Maintain aspect
Here you can set the Maintain aspect option specifically for this file. The default setting will keep the Maintain aspect option you choose globally.
Video properties
Track
The auto option tells & mplayer; to choose a video track automatically. The set ID option lets you enter a number giving the video track ID to play. This option is set when you select a video track from the Video submenu of the Player menu. The submenu will list the available video tracks for files and streams that have more than one video track.
Contrast, Brightness, Hue and Saturation
The default option uses the same setting as for other files. The set to option sets the specified initial contrast, brightness, hue or saturation when loading the file. The add and subtract options adjust the contrast, brightness, hue or saturation relative to the normal setting. See the introduction section of this HOWTO for more details and some examples of how this works.
Codec
Specifies the video codec to use when playing this file. The default setting will use the codec chosen on the Video page in kplayer; Settings, normally auto. The auto setting will tell & mplayer; to choose the codec it thinks is the best for playing this file.
Bitrate and Framerate
The video bitrate and framerate of the file or stream. These properties are read only.
Input
The auto option tells & mplayer; to choose a TV or DVB input automatically. The set to option lets you enter a number giving the device input to use. Only applicable to TV, PVR and DVB devices.
Format
The auto option tells & mplayer; to choose a TV video output format automatically. The other options let you specify the video format explicitly. Only applicable to TV and PVR devices.
Norm
The auto option tells & mplayer; to choose a TV norm automatically. The set ID option lets you enter a number giving the TV norm. The other options let you specify the TV norm explicitly. Only applicable to TV and PVR devices.
Audio properties
The auto option tells & mplayer; to choose an audio track automatically. The set ID option lets you enter a number giving the audio track ID to play. This option is set when you select an audio track from the Audio submenu of the Player menu. The submenu will list the available audio tracks for files and streams that have more than one audio track.
Volume
The default option uses the same sound volume as for other files. The set to option sets the specified initial volume when loading the file. The add and substract options will adjust the volume relative to the normal volume level. See the introduction section of this HOWTO for more details and some examples of how this works.
Delay
Delay of the sound relative to video. By default this property is remembered automatically when you use Increase Delay and Decrease Delay commands from the Audio submenu of the Player menu. The default setting always resets audio delay to zero when a file is loaded.
This specifies the audio codec to use when playing this file. The default setting will use the codec chosen on the Audio page in kplayer; Settings, normally auto. The auto setting will tell & mplayer; to choose the codec it thinks is the best for playing this file.
Bitrate and Samplerate
The audio bitrate and samplerate of the file or stream. These properties are read only.
Mode
The auto option tells & mplayer; to choose a TV audio mode automatically. The other options let you specify the audio mode explicitly. Only applicable to TV and PVR devices.
The auto option tells & mplayer; to choose a TV or DVB audio input automatically. The set to option lets you enter a number giving the audio input to use. Only applicable to TV, PVR and DVB devices.
Immediate mode
When disabled, & mplayer; will capture audio from the same device as video. When enabled, tells & mplayer; to capture audio through a cable going from the TV card to the sound card. Only applicable to TV and PVR devices.
Capture and Device
The audio capture system, either ALSA or OSS, and the input device. Only applicable to TV and PVR devices.
Subtitle properties
The none option disables subtitle display. The external option tells & mplayer; to display subtitles loaded from an external file given by the External path property below. The set ID option lets you enter a number giving the ID of an internal subtitle track to display. This option is set when you load subtitles from a subtitle file or when you select a subtitle track or the None option from the Subtitles submenu of the Player menu. The submenu lists the available subtitles for files and streams that have embedded subtitle tracks or for which you load subtitles from a subtitle file.
External path
Path to the subtitle file to be loaded for this file or stream. This property is set automatically when you use the Load Subtitles... command on the File menu or drag and drop subtitle files onto & kplayer; window or use a command on the Subtitles submenu of the Player menu to display subtitles from an external subtitle file.
External type
The auto option tells & kplayer; to determine the type of the external subtitles based on the file extension. The vobsub option sets the VobSub type explicitly, and the normal option tells & kplayer; that these are not VobSub subtitles.
Encoding
The encoding of the text in the subtitle file. If & mplayer; does not decode the subtitles properly, set this property to the correct encoding. You can also set the encoding globally in kplayer; Settings if most of your subtitle files share the same encoding.
Framerate
The auto option uses the frame rate of the video file. If the subtitle file does not have the same framerate as the video, specify it in this property.
Autoload
Tells & kplayer; whether to try to autoload subtitles for this file. The default setting uses the Autoload options from the Subtitles page in kplayer; Settings. This property is only available for local files. For all other URL s it is set to no.
Position
Vertical subtitle position, 0 being at the top of the video area, and 100 at the bottom. The default setting simply keeps the last used position.
Delay of the subtitles relative to video. By default this property is remembered automatically when you use Increase Delay and Decrease Delay commands from the Subtitles submenu of the Player menu. The default setting always resets subtitle delay to zero when a file with subtitles is loaded.
Closed caption
Choose whether to display or hide closed caption subtitles. You can set this property on a device, on a disk, or on an individual title on a DVD. Other kinds of media do not have this property.
Advanced properties
Additional command line arguments
Lets you specify additional arguments to be passed to & mplayer;. You can either append the arguments to the ones given on the Advanced page in kplayer; Settings or override them. The default option uses the arguments given in kplayer; Settings.
Demuxer
This specifies the demultiplexer to use when playing this file. The default setting will use the demuxer chosen on the Advanced page in kplayer; Settings, normally auto. The auto setting will tell & mplayer; to choose the demuxer it thinks is the best for playing this file.
Frame drop
If your system is too slow to play the file properly, you can tell & mplayer; to drop some frames. The soft setting drops fewer frames than the hard one, so you should try it first. The default setting uses the Frame drop option from the Advanced page in kplayer; Settings. You can also change this option while playing a file using commands on the Advanced submenu of the Player menu. If you hold & Shift; when choosing them, & kplayer; by default will remember the property for the current file.
Cache size
Here you can set the cache size & mplayer; should use for this file. See the Cache size sections in Advanced configuration micro-HOWTO, kde; I/ O Slaves micro-HOWTO and Online Radio and TV micro-HOWTO for details.
Build index
This property allows you to choose whether & mplayer; should build a new index always (force), never (no) or only if the file does not have it (yes).
Use KIOSlave
Some URL types, like HTTP, FTP and Samba, can be played either directly with & mplayer; or through a kde; I/ O Slave. Generally you should set this option if & mplayer; cannot play those URL s directly.
Use temporary file
When playing a URL using a & kde; I/ O Slave, data can either be passed to & mplayer; through a named pipe or stored in a temporary file before playing. For URL s passed directly to & mplayer; this option has no effect.
Hardware compression
Enables MJPEG compression in hardware for a TV device and lets you specify the decimation (image size) and the compression quality from 0 to 100. Only applicable to PVR and TV devices that support hardware compression.
Original size
Bitrate
The audio bitrate of the file. This property is read only. For variable bitrate files this will show the initial bitrate.
Visibility
Subtitle visibility. The default setting always shows subtitles when a file with subtitles is loaded.
