Show available commands
Command (see --commands)
Arguments for command
Syntax:
kfmclient openURL'url '['mimetype'] # Opens a window showing'url '. # 'url' may be a relative path # or file name, such as. or subdir/ # If'url 'is omitted, $HOME is used instead.
# If'mimetype 'is specified, it will be used to determine the # component that Konqueror should use. For instance, set it to # text/ html for a web page, to make it appear faster
kfmclient newTab'url '['mimetype'] # Same as above but opens a new tab with'url 'in an existing Konqueror # window on the current active desktop if possible.
kfmclient openProfile'profile '['url'] # Opens a window using the given profile. # 'profile 'is a file under ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqueror/ profiles. # 'url' is an optional URL to open.
Profile %1 not found
Syntax Error: Not enough arguments
Syntax Error: Too many arguments
Syntax Error: Unknown command '%1 '
kfmclient openProperties'url '# Opens a properties menu
kfmclient exec ['url '['binding']] # Tries to execute'url '. 'url' may be a usual # URL, this URL will be opened. You may omit # 'binding '. In this case the default binding
# is tried. Of course URL may be the URL of a # document, or it may be a *. desktop file.
# This way you could for example mount a device # by passing'Mount default 'as binding to # 'cdrom. desktop'
kfmclient move'src ''dest' # Moves the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kfmclient download ['src '] # Copies the URL'src' to a user specified location '. # 'src' may be a list of URLs, if not present then # a URL will be requested.
kfmclient copy'src ''dest' # Copies the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kfmclient sortDesktop # Rearranges all icons on the desktop.
kfmclient configure # Re-read Konqueror's configuration.
kfmclient configureDesktop # Re-read kdesktop's configuration.

kfmclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html / / Opens the file with default binding
kfmclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html Netscape / / Opens the file with netscape
kfmclient exec ftp: / /localhost/ / / Opens new window with URL
kfmclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ emacs. desktop / / Starts emacs
kfmclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop / / Opens the CD-ROM's mount directory
kfmclient exec. / / Opens the current directory. Very convenient.
