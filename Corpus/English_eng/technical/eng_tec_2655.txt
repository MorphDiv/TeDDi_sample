Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
dbplus_rcreate() will create a new relation named name.
An existing relation by the same name will only be overwritten if the relation is currently not in use and overwrite is set to TRUE.
domlist should contain the domain specification for the new relation within an array of domain description strings. (dbplus_rcreate() will also accept a string with space delimited domain description strings, but it is recommended to use an array).
A domain description string consists of a domain name unique to this relation, a slash and a type specification character.
See the db+ + documentation, especially the dbcreate( 1) manpage, for a description of available type specifiers and their meanings.
