PHP Manual

(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Given a string containing a path to a file, this function will return the name of the directory.
On Windows, both slash (/) and backslash (\) are used as path separator character.
In other environments, it is the forward slash (/).
Example 1. dirname() example
$path = "/ etc / passwd"; $file = dirname ($path); / / $file is set to" / etc "
Note:
In PHP 4.0.3, dirname() was fixed to be POSIX-compliant.
Essentially, this means that if there are no slashes in path, a dot ('.') is returned, indicating the current directory.
Otherwise, the returned string is path with any trailing / component removed.
Note that this means that you will often get a slash or a dot back from dirname() in situations where the older functionality would have given you the empty string.
See also: basename(), pathinfo(), and realpath().
