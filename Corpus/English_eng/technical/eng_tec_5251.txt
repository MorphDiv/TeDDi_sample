The only array operator in PHP is the + operator.
It appends the right handed array to the left handed, whereas duplicated keys are NOT overwritten.
$a = array( "a "= "apple", "b" = "banana"); $b = array("a "= "pear", "b" = "strawberry", "c "= "cherry"); $c = $a + $b; var_dump($c);
array( 3) {["a"]= string(5) "apple "["b"]= string(6) "banana" ["c"]= string(6) "cherry "}
