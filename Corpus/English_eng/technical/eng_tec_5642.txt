Bomber
Introduction
Gametype:
Arcade
Number of possible players:
One
& bomber; is a single player arcade game. The player is invading various cities in a plane that is decreasing in height.
The goal of the game is to destroy all the buildings and advance to the next level. Each level gets a harder by increasing the speed of the plane and the height of the buildings.
How To Play
The player is flying a plane in a city. The plane flies from left to right. Everytime it disappears off the side of the play area, it reappears on the left side again, but lower than it was before.
The player has to destroy all the buildings to clear the level. If the plane crashes into a building, then the player loses a life and the plane is moved to the top left of the play area again.
Buildings are destroyed by dropping bombs on them. This can be done by clicking the & LMB; or pressing the Space key. The bomb will fall from the plane and hit anything directly below it.
After clearing a level, the player advances to the next level. Each level gets slightly harder than the previous level as the buildings get taller and the plane gets faster.
