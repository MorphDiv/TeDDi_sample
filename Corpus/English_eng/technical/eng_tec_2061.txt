Defining Print Ranges on a Sheet
You can define which range of cells on a spreadsheet to print.
The cells on the sheet that are not part of the defined print range are not printed or exported.
Sheets without a defined print range are not printed and not exported to a PDF file, unless the document uses the Microsoft Excel file format.
For files opened in Excel format, all sheets that do not contain a defined print range are printed.
The same behaviour occurs when you export the Excel formatted spreadsheet to a PDF file.

Format - Print Ranges - Define

To Add Cells to a Print Range
