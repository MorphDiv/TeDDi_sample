Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
mysql_close() closes the connection to the MySQL server that's associated with the specified link identifier.
If link_identifier isn 't specified, the last opened link is used.
Using mysql_close() isn't usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are automatically closed at the end of the script's execution.
See also freeing resources.
Example 1.
MySQL close example
?php $link = mysql_connect( "localhost", "mysql_user", "mysql_password") or die("Could not connect: ". mysql_error()); print ("Connected successfully"); mysql_close($link);?
