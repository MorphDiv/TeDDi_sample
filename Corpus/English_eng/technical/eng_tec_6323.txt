Monitor & Display
This module allows you to change the various monitor and display settings.
Changes in this module are stored in / etc/ X11/ xorg. conf and are the main settings that control the refresh rate, resolution, color, power saving, and driver configuration. This module is separated into four sections:
Size, Orientation, & Positioning (see)
Color & Gamma (see)
Hardware (see)
Power saving (see)
Size, Orientation, & Position
This section allows you to configure the Screen size, Refresh, Monitor Orientation, as well as a Second screen if you have one installed.
Monitor Orientation
Normal
This is the default setting and the most common setting. This will cause your desktop to be displayed horizontally.
Left edge on top
This setting will allow you to rotate your desktop ninety degrees clockwise, or to the right. Screen resolutions are greater horizontally, so this setting is used mostly for people who write often and need a page to be displayed longer than it would be in the Normal orientation.
Right edge on top
This is the same as the previous, Left edge on top, however it rotates your desktop ninety degrees counter-clockwise, or to the left.
Upsidedown
This option flips your desktop orientation horizontally, making the desktop appear upside down. This is used if you were to mount your monitor upside down from a shelving unit or such. After doing so, selecting this will make your desktop appear correctly and not upside down.
Second screen
Clone primary screen
This option puts your desktop on both displays.
Dual screen
This option extends your desktop to another screen providing you with double the amount of workspace.
Screen size
Lower
This side of the slider provides a lower resolution.
Higher
This side of the slider provides a higher resolution.
Resolution
Dropdown dialog
This dropdown selection allows you to select a proper resolution. Depending on your monitor, you may only have one selection.
Color & Gamma
This section allows you to configure the color calibration of your display by utilizing a pre-configured setting or by your own custom setting. Unless you are sure about what settings you need, the default color and gamma is usually the best.
Color calibration image
Gamma controls how your monitor displays colors.
For accurate color reproduction, adjust the gamma correction sliders until the squares blend into the background as much as possible.
Screen
This option allows you to select the screen you would like to configure. You will only have Screen 1 as a selection unless you have more than one display.
Gamma correction
All
This slider allows you to control the red, green, and blue colors at one time in unison.
Red
Green
Blue
This selection allows you independently change each color setting to your preference.
Target gamma
This dropdown dialog allows you to select from various pre-configured settings which are considered an industry standard in some aspects.
