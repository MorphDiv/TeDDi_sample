Referencing a Cell in Another Document
In a sheet cell you can show a reference to a cell in another sheet.
In the same way, a reference can also be made to a cell from another document provided that this document has already been saved as a file.
To Reference a Cell in the Same Document
Open a new, empty spreadsheet.
By way of example, enter the following formula in cell A1 of Sheet1:
=Sheet2.A1
Sheet 2
tab at the bottom of the spreadsheet.
Set the cursor in cell A1 there and enter text or a number.
If you switch back to Sheet1, you will see the same content in cell A1 there.
If the contents of Sheet2.A1 change, then the contents of Sheet1.A1 also change.
To Reference a Cell in Another Document
File - Open
, to load an existing spreadsheet document.
File - New
, to open a new spreadsheet document.
Set the cursor in the cell where you want to insert the external data and enter an equals sign to indicate that you want to begin a formula.
Now switch to the document you have just loaded.
Click the cell with the data that you want to insert in the new document.
Switch back to the new spreadsheet.
In the input line you will now see how $[officename] Calc has added the reference to the formula for you.
The reference to a cell of another document contains the name of the other document in single inverted commas, then a hash #, then the name of the sheet of the other document, followed by a point and the name of the cell.
Confirm the formula by clicking the green tick mark.
If you drag the box in the lower right corner of the active cell to select a range of cells, $[officename] automatically inserts the corresponding references in the adjacent cells.
As a result, the sheet name is preceded with a &quot; $ &quot; sign to designate it as an absolute reference.
