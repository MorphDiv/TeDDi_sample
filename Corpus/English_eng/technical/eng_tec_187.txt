Statistical Functions Part Four
MAX function
MAX
Returns the maximum value in a list of arguments.
Returns 0 if no numerical value and no error was encountered in the cell range(s) passed as cell reference(s).
Text cells are ignored by MIN() and MAX().
The functions MINA() and MAXA() return 0 if no value (numeric or text) and no error was encountered.
Passing a literal string argument to MIN() or MAX(), e.g.
MIN( &quot; string &quot; ), still results in an error.
Syntax:
MAX(Number1; Number2; ...
Number30)
Number1; Number2; ...
Number30
are 1 to 30 numerical values or ranges.
Examples:
=MAX(A1; A2; A3; 50; 100; 200)
returns the largest value from the list.
=MAX(A1:B100)
returns the largest value from the list.
MAXA function
MAXA
Returns the maximum value in a list of arguments.
Unlike MAX, you can also use text strings.

Syntax:
MAXA(Value1; Value2; ...
Value30)
Value1; Value2; ...
Value30
are 1 to 30 values or ranges.
Text has the value of 0.

returns the largest value from the list.
=MAXA(A1:B100)
returns the largest value from the list.
MEDIAN function
MEDIAN
Returns the median of a set of numbers.
In a set containing an uneven number of values, the median will be the number in the middle of the set and in a set containing an even number of values, it will be the mean of the two values in the middle of the set.
Syntax:
MEDIAN(Number1; Number2; ...
Number30)
Number1; Number2; ...

7.
MIN function

Returns the minimum value in a list of arguments.
Returns 0 if no numerical value and no error was encountered in the cell range(s) passed as cell reference(s).
Text cells are ignored by MIN() and MAX().
The functions MINA() and MAXA() return 0 if no value (numeric or text) and no error was encountered.
Passing a literal string argument to MIN() or MAX(), e.g.
MIN( &quot; string &quot; ), still results in an error.
Syntax:
MIN(Number1; Number2; ...
Number30)
Number1; Number2; ...

Syntax:
MINA(Value1; Value2; ...
Value30)
Value1; Value2; ...
Value30
are 1 to 30 values or ranges.
Text has the value of 0.
Example:
=MINA(1; &quot; Text &quot; ; 20)
returns 0.
=MINA(A1:B100)
returns the smallest value in the list.

Text has the value of 0.
Example:
=AVERAGEA(A1:A50)
MODE function
most common value
mw added one entry
MODE
Returns the most common value in a data set.
If there are several values with the same frequency, it returns the smallest value.
An error occurs when a value doesn't appear twice.
Syntax:
MODE(Number1; Number2; ...

Number1; Number2; ...
Number30
are 1 to 30 numerical values or ranges.
Example:
=MODE(A1:A50)
NEGBINOMDIST function
negative binomial distribution
