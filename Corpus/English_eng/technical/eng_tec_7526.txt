Dogs
4.2 Indications for use
Treatment of acute localised moist dermatitis.

Do not use in dogs with extensive lesions.
Do not use in dogs with infected lesions of bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic origin or with ulcerated lesions.
Do not use in animals suffering from Cushing’ s syndrome.

4.4 Special warnings for each target species
Since glucocorticosteroids can slow growth, use in young, growing animals should be well controlled and large lesions should not be treated.
4.5 Special precaution(s) for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Lesions should be monitored closely for signs of infection.
In case of diabetes mellitus, the potential systemic effects of the product may influence glycaemia.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
This product belongs to the class of dermocorticoids.
The therapeutic use of these substances in humans has been recognised to induce local side effects such as skin thinning, skin weakness, delayed healing process and secondary infections.
Avoid contact with the product.
Wear disposable gloves when applying the product.
Wash hands after use.
2/ 15 4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
On rare occasions hyperaemia of the treated area has been observed.
4.7 Use during pregnancy and lactation
Do not use in dogs for breeding nor in lactating or pregnant bitches.
4.8 Interaction with other veterinary medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Do not apply other topical preparations concomitantly to the same lesions.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
During initial treatment apply the cream twice daily.
Apply a 1 cm strip (0.2 g) of cream per 10 cm2 of lesion.
Treat for 7 to 14 days.
The treatment period should not exceed 14 days.
Clean the affected areas and clip the hair covering the lesions before application.
Wearing disposable gloves, apply the cream gently to the lesion.
It is recommended that the animal be distracted for several minutes following treatment to prevent licking (oral absorption of the cream is not harmful to the dog, but removal of the cream by licking directly after treatment might decrease efficacy).
The dog should be re-examined by the veterinarian if the lesion is not cured after 14 days of treatment.
4.10 Overdose
The maximum total surface of lesions (treated in cm2) should not exceed 10 times the body weight (in kg).
For example, the total surface area treated of a dog weighing 5 kg should not exceed 50 cm2).
Overdosing, i. e. application rate of more than twice a day, or extension of the duration of treatment, increases the risk of glucocorticoid systemic effects particularly when administered on extensive lesions.
4.11 Withdrawal periods
Not applicable.
