Printing Rows or Columns on Every Page
If you have a sheet that is so large that it will be printed multiple pages, you can set up rows or columns to repeat on each printed page.
As an example, If you want to print the top two rows of the sheet as well as the first column (A)on all pages, do the following:
Format - Print Ranges - Edit
.
The
Edit Print Ranges
dialogue box appears.
Rows to repeat
area.
The dialogue box shrinks so that you can see more of the sheet.
Select the first two rows and, for this example, click cell A1 and drag to A2.
In the shrunken dialogue box you will see $1:$2.
Rows 1 and 2 are now rows to repeat.
Rows to repeat

The dialogue box is restored again.

Click column A (not in the column header).
