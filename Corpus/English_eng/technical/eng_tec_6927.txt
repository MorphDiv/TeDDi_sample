Fine Tuning your Browsing Experience
Using your own style for webpages
Webpages come in every possible set of colors and fonts, and sometimes this does n't give the best result. For example, if you have visual difficulties, it may be impossible to read certain combinations of background and text colors. & konqueror; provides a way to choose your own colors and apply them to all webpages. Here's how:
Open & konqueror; and go to Settings Configure Konqueror....
In the configuration dialog that appears, select the Stylesheets page on the left hand side.
On this page, choose Use accessibility stylesheet defined in "Customize" tab, then go to the Customize tab, and choose the settings you prefer.
Close all & konqueror; windows (you may need to restart & kde; to be sure) and when you re-open them, your settings should be applied.
