Mouse This module allows you to choose various options for the way in which your pointing device works. Your pointing device may be a mouse, trackball, or some other hardware that performs a similar function.
& General
If you are left-handed, you may prefer to swap the functions of the left and right buttons on your pointing device by choosing the'left-handed 'option. If your pointing device has more than two buttons, only those that function as the left and right buttons are affected. For example, if you have a three-button mouse, the middle button is unaffected.
The default behavior in KDE is to select and activate icons with a single click of the left button on your pointing device. This behavior is consistent with what you would expect when you click links in most web browsers. If you would prefer to select with a single click, and activate with a double click, check this option.
Activates and opens a file or folder with a single click.
If you check this option, pausing the mouse pointer over an icon on the screen will automatically select that icon. This may be useful when single clicks activate icons, and you want only to select the icon without activating it.
If you have checked the option to automatically select icons, this slider allows you to select how long the mouse pointer must be paused over the icon before it is selected.

Pointer acceleration:
This option allows you to change the relationship between the distance that the mouse pointer moves on the screen and the relative movement of the physical device itself (which may be a mouse, trackball, or some other pointing device.) A high value for the acceleration will lead to large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small movement with the physical device. Selecting very high values may result in the mouse pointer flying across the screen, making it hard to control.
Pointer threshold:
The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move on the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement is smaller than the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set to 1X; thus, when you make small movements with the physical device, there is no acceleration at all, giving you a greater degree of control over the mouse pointer. With larger movements of the physical device, you can move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.
msec
Double click interval:
The double click interval is the maximal time (in milliseconds) between two mouse clicks which turns them into a double click. If the second click happens later than this time interval after the first click, they are recognized as two separate clicks.
Drag start time:
If you click with the mouse (e. g. in a multi-line editor) and begin to move the mouse within the drag start time, a drag operation will be initiated.
Drag start distance:
If you click with the mouse and begin to move the mouse at least the drag start distance, a drag operation will be initiated.
Mouse wheel scrolls by:
If you use the wheel of a mouse, this value determines the number of lines to scroll for each wheel movement. Note that if this number exceeds the number of visible lines, it will be ignored and the wheel movement will be handled as a page up/ down movement.

You have a Logitech Mouse connected, and libusb was found at compile time, but it was not possible to access this mouse. This is probably caused by a permissions problem - you should consult the manual on how to fix this.
