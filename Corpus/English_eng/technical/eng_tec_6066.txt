About Your & kde; Account
& kde; stores information about your personal settings in a few different places:
The hidden directory. kde (note the period at the beginning), located in your home directory, contains a large number of files that store & kde; settings. Some subdirectories you may find useful are:. kde/ share/ config, which contains configuration files for individual applications;. kde/ Autostart, which contains links to applications which should start each time you start & kde;; and. kde/ share/ apps/ kabc, where your address book is stored.
The environment variables KDEDIR and KDEDIRS tell & kde; where its files are stored. You will usually only need to set KDEDIR to the directory in which & kde; is installed, but sometimes you might have other & kde; programs installed elsewhere: in this case, you can use the KDEDIRS environment variable. Set KDEDIRS to a list of all the directories containing & kde; programs, separated by commas. For example, if you have & kde; programs in both / usr/ local/ kde and / home/ phil/ kde, you can use export KDEDIR=/ usr/ local/ kde, / home/ phil/ kde if you use bash or setenv KDEDIR=/ usr/ local/ kde, / home/ phil/ kde if you use sh.
