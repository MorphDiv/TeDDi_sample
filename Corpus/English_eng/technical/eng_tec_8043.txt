EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ALDURAZYME
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Aldurazyme?
Aldurazyme is a solution for infusion (drip into a vein).
It contains the active substance laronidase.
What is Aldurazyme used for?
Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological symptoms of the disease (not connected with the brain or nerves).
MPS I is a rare, inherited disease, where the level of α -L-iduronidase enzyme activity is much lower than normal.
This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, GAGs) are not broken down, so they build up in most of the organs in the body and damage them.
The non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can be an enlarged liver, stiff joints which make moving more difficult, less lung volume, heart disease and eye disease.
Because the number of patients with MPS I is low, the disease is considered ‘ rare’, and Aldurazyme was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 14 February 2001.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Aldurazyme used?
Aldurazyme treatment should be supervised by a doctor experienced in the management of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.
Administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic where resuscitation equipment is available, and patients may need to receive some medicines before the infusion to prevent an allergic reaction.
Aldurazyme is given once every week as an intravenous infusion.
Aldurazyme is designed for long-term use.
How does Aldurazyme work?
The active ingredient in Aldurazyme, laronidase, is a copy of the human enzyme α -L-iduronidase.
It is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: the enzyme is made by a cell which has received a gene (DNA) that makes it able to produce the enzyme.
Laronidase replaces the enzyme missing in patients with MPS I.
By supplying the missing enzyme, the symptoms of MPS I are controlled and this improves the patient ’ s quality of life.

Aldurazyme has been studied in 45 patients aged five years and over with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS I.
The study compared the effect of Aldurazyme to that of placebo (a dummy treatment).
The main measure of effectiveness was the lung function (forced vital capacity, FVC) and the distance the patients could walk over six minutes before and after 26 weeks of treatment, but the study continued for up to four years.
Aldurazyme has also been studied in 20 children below the age of five years who received Aldurazyme for a year.
The study was looking mainly at the safety of the medicine, but it also measured its effectiveness (looking at its effect on reducing levels of GAGs in the urine and on the size of the liver).
What benefit has Aldurazyme shown during the studies?
The study showed that Aldurazyme had improved both the FVC and the walking ability of patients at 26 weeks.
This effect was maintained for up to four years.
In children under five years of age, Aldurazyme reduced the levels of GAGs in the urine by about 60% and half of the children treated had a liver of a normal size at the end of the study.
What is the risk associated with Aldurazyme?
Most of the side effects seen with Aldurazyme are reactions caused by the infusion rather than the medicine itself.
These are generally mild to moderate in intensity and decrease with time.
The most common side effects with Aldurazyme in patients over the age of five (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are headache, nausea (feeling sick), abdominal (tummy) pain, rash, arthropathy (damage to the joints), arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the extremities (hands and feet), flushing, pyrexia (fever) and reactions at the site of the infusion.
In patients under five years of age, the very common side effects are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (fast heart rate), pyrexia and chills.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Aldurazyme, see the Package Leaflet.
Almost all patients who receive Aldurazyme develop antibodies (proteins that are produced in response to Aldurazyme).
The effect of these on the safety and effectiveness of the medicine is not fully known.
Aldurazyme should not be used in people who may have a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) to laronidase or any of the other ingredients.
Why has Aldurazyme been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Aldurazyme gives effective control of the symptoms of MPS I.
The Committee decided that Aldurazyme’ s benefits are greater than its risks for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS I.
The Committee recommended that Aldurazyme be given marketing authorisation.
Aldurazyme has been authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’.
This means that, because the disease is rare, it has not been possible to obtain complete information about Aldurazyme.
Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary.
What information is still awaited for Aldurazyme?
The company that makes Aldurazyme will monitor patients receiving Aldurazyme, looking at reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.
Other information about Aldurazyme:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aldurazyme to Genzyme Europe B. V. on 10 June 2003.
The record of Aldurazyme’ s designation as an orphan medicine is available here The full EPAR for Aldurazyme can be found here.
