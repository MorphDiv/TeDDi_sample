Configuring & kpresenter;
The Configure Autocorrection... Dialog
Auto correction is a system for correcting common typing errors, converting abbreviations to their full spelling and adjusting capitalization. As you could guess from its name, this all occurs automatically, while you are editing your document.
Enabling/ Disabling Autocorrection
To toggle autocorrection on, select Text Autocorrection Enable Autocorrection from the menubar. When enabled, autocorrection makes changes to your document as you type. You can determine which changes to make by configuring autocorrection, as explained below.
To toggle autocorrection off, select Text Autocorrection Disable Autocorrection from the menubar. When disabled, autocorrection changes are not made. You can, however, apply autocorrection manually, using the Text Autocorrection Apply Autocorrection menu.
To adjust the options for autocorrection, select Settings Configure Autocorrection... from the menubar.
A dialog window appears to help you set your options, with four tabs: Simple Autocorrection, Custom Quotes, Advanced Autocorrection and Exceptions.
Simple Autocorrection
Simple Autocorrection
Simple Autocorrection
Convert first letter of a sentence automatically to uppercase
When selected, & kpresenter; will automatically capitalize the first letter after a period. You can tell & kpresenter; when not to alter capitalization in certain instances (ie ;“ Sr.” or“ Jr. ”). For more details, see the section entitled Autocorrection Exceptions.
Convert two uppercase characters to one uppercase and one lowercase character
When selected, & kpresenter; will automatically convert a double capital letter (a common typographical error), into a single capital letter. You can tell & kpresenter; when not to alter capitalization in certain instances. For more details, see the section entitled Autocorrection Exceptions.
Autoformat URLs
When selected, & kpresenter; will scan text for patterns which suggest a certain section of text is a & URL; and automatically creates a link.
Suppress double spaces
When checked, & kpresenter; will ignore the second space typed. This prevents users from adding double spaces between words or sentences
Remove spaces at the beginning and end of paragraphs
When selected, & kpresenter; will automatically remove spaces at the beginning and/ or the end of a line of text.
Automatically do bold and underline formatting
When selected, & kpresenter; will look for words surrounded by asterisks (*). It will remove the asterisks and change the font of all words in between the two asterisks to bold face.
& kpresenter; will also look for words surrounded by underscores (_). It will remove the underscores and underline all words in between the two underscores.
Replace 1/ 2... with ½...
When selected, & kpresenter; will automatically change 1/ 2, 1/ 3 and 3/ 4 to their single character equivalents.
Use autonumbering for numbered paragraphs
If you start a paragraph with a number and a symbol (1) for example), & kpresenter; will automatically convert that paragraph to a numbered paragraph. All future paragraphs will be consecutively numbered.
Replace 1st with 1^st...
When selected, & kpresenter; will automatically change 1st to 1 st.
Capitalize name of days
Automatically capitalize the days of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc...).
Use list-formatting for bulleted paragraphs
When selected, & kpresenter; will look for lines that begin with -, and automatically convert the paragraph style to a bulleted list. The bullet is selected with the left button below this option.
Custom Quotes
Select the tab labeled Custom Quotes
Custom Quotes
Custom Quotes
Replace double quotes with typographical quotes
When selected, this option will replace the standard keyboard double quotes, with typographical quotation marks. If you want to change the quotation character, click on one of the buttons. Clicking on Default, restores the default quotation marks.
Replace single quotes with typographical quotes
When selected, this option will replace the standard keyboard single quotes, with typographical quotation marks. If you want to change the quotation character, click on one of the buttons. Clicking on Default, restores the default quotation marks.
Advanced Autocorrection
To switch to the Advanced Autocorrection, click on the tab labeled Advanced Autocorrection.
Advanced Autocorrection
Advanced Autocorrection
This allows you to automatically have & kpresenter; replace one string of text with another. This can be useful for special symbols, commonly used abbreviations that you want spelled out, or common typing errors.
& kpresenter; uses different autocorrection strings depending on the language. Set the correct language using the combo box labeled Replacement and exceptions for language:.
The check box labeled Enable word replacement is used to toggle on and off the autoreplacement features of & kpresenter;. If there is no mark in the check box, then & kpresenter; will not perform any autoreplacements from the list in this dialog.
If there is a mark in the check box labeled Replace text with format & kpresenter; will not only change the text when it finds a match, but it will change the formatting of the new text. If there is no mark in this check box, then & kpresenter; uses the same formatting options for the replaced text as it found in the search text. For more information on setting the format options for replacement text, see the section on Changing the format of the autocorrection string.
Adding an autocorrection string
To add an autocorrection string, simply type the text you want & kpresenter; to check for in the text box labeled Find:, then enter the text you want & kpresenter; to substitute in the text box labeled Replace:.
If you want to insert symbols or special characters not available on your keyboard, you can click the buttons with three periods on them and select a special character from the table provided.
When these are entered, click Add.... Your text strings are now added to the table.
Editing an autocorrection string
Changing the text you want to find.
& kpresenter; does not allow you to change the text to search for. This is to prevent disastrous mistakes.
Instead, you must delete the current autocorrection rule and add a new text string with the corrected text to find.
Changing the text you want to replace.
Begin by clicking once on the string you want to edit. It will be highlighted and the find and replace text will be listed in the text boxes above. You can alter the replacement text. When you are done, simply click on the Modify button.
Deleting an autocorrection string
Simply click on the string you want to delete. Now click the Remove button. The string is removed.
Be aware that & kpresenter; does not give you a chance to back out once you have deleted a string. Be sure you have selected the correct string before you click the Remove button.
Changing the format of the autocorrection string
Currently, you must create the autocorrection string before you can format it.
Once the autocorrection string has been created, simply click on it once with the & LMB;.
Now click on the Change Format... button. A small dialog will appear:
You can use this dialog to select the format of the replaced text.
The left column consists of 13 check boxes. If there is a mark in the check box, then & kpresenter; will change any replaced text to match the property selected. If no mark is in the check box, & kpresenter; does not consider that property when replacing text.
Family:
Use this combo box to select the font family you want your replacement text to use.
Size:
Use this spin box to set the font size you want & kpresenter; to use for your replaced text.
Color: and Background color:
Clicking on either of these two buttons allows you to select the font color and/ or background color respectively, you want & kpresenter; to use.
Bold: and Italic:
Use these Yes / No radio buttons to determine whether you want & kpresenter; to change the fonts to boldface or italicized fonts.
Strikeout:
You can select None, Single, Double or Simple Bold to use for the replacement text.
Underline:
You can select None, Single, Double, Simple Bold or Wave to use for the replacement text.
Vertical alignment:
You can select Normal, Superscript or Subscript to determine what font alignment you want & kpresenter; to use.
Shadow: and Word by word:
Use these Yes / No radio buttons to determine whether you want & kpresenter; to use shadow text and/ or word by word underlining and strikethrough in the replacement text.
Capitalization:
You can select Normal, Uppercase, Lowercase, or Small Caps to determine what capitalization to use for the replacement text.
Language:
You can select the language of the text you will use to replace the found text.
Once you have selected your options, click OK to accept your text options.
Click Cancel to ignore all changes.
Click Reset to restore the options dialog box to the initial values prior to making any changes.
Click Clear to remove all marks from the checked options.
Exceptions
There are instances where & kpresenter; will make autocorrection changes that are inappropriate. You can use the fourth tab of this dialog to define exceptions to the rules previously discussed.
The dialog for exceptions is shown below:
Exceptions
Exceptions
To prevent & kpresenter; from deciding an abbreviation or other text is the end of a sentence, simply enter the text fragment in the text box below Do not treat as the end of a sentence:. Then click Add.
As an example: Adding Jr. to this dialog prevents
Robert Jones Jr. is a friend of the family.
from being changed to:
Robert Jones Jr. Is a friend of the family.
To remove an erroneous entry, simply click once on the wrong entry with the & LMB; and click on the Remove button.
The second set of boxes performs a similar function to the first except text entered in these boxes will allow two capital letters in a word if it is entered in this text box.
Simply enter the word in the text box below Accept two uppercase letters in:. Then click Add.
As an example: Adding CD to this dialog prevents
CD
Cd
Manually applying autocorrection
If autocorrection is turned off in your document, you can manually enable autocorrection.
To manually apply autocorrection, first configure your options by using the autocorrection dialogs.
Then select Text Autocorrection Apply Autocorrection from the menubar.
& kpresenter; will start at the beginning of the document and apply all selected autocorrection options to the entire document.
When & kpresenter; is finished, it will return you to your document for further editing.
For more information on enabling and disabling autocorrection, see Enabling/ Disabling Autocorrection.
The Configure Completion Dialog
Autocompletion allows you to type the first few letters of a commonly used word (often technical or job specific), and tells & kpresenter; to finish typing the word for you. This is often very useful when you have lengthy technical words.
Using autocompletion
Using autocompletion could not be easier. Simply type the first few letters of the word you want & kpresenter; to finish, and press Ctrl; E. & kpresenter; will look through the list of autocompletion words and if it finds a word which begins with those letters, it will finish entering the remainder of the word.
Adding words to autocompletion
& kpresenter; maintains a list of words for each user that will be used for autocompletion.
You can add words to this list one of two ways:
& kpresenter; can automatically add new words to the completion list for later approval. This is selected using the dialog.
Individual words can be added to the list by using the dialog.
Configuring autocomplete
To configure autocompletion, select Settings Configure Completion... from the menubar. This will bring up a dialog.
Completion Dialog
Completion Dialog
Enable word completion
It is used to toggle autocompletion on and off.
Add
By clicking this button you can manually add an individual word to the completion list.
Remove
To remove words from the completion list, select the word with the & LMB; from the list, then click this button.
Automatically add new words to suggestion list
This option will add any word equal to or longer than the Characters needed: to the list of proposed autocompletion words.
The large listbox in the center of the dialog contains the current proposed list of autocompletion words.
Not all words listed in the list box will be immediatly affected by autocompletion when entered into this dialog.
Show words in tooltip
If this option is enabled, a tooltip box will appear when you type the beginning of a word that exists in the completion list. To complete the word, press the key you set to accept suggestions in the Key to accept suggestion: drop-down list.
Characters needed:
Use this spinbox/ slider combination to prevent & kpresenter; from automatically adding short words to the completion list. You can select any value from 5-100 and the words will need to be at least the number of characters set here to be added in the list.
Suggest words:
This spinbox/ slider combination can be adjusted to allow more or less words into the autocompletion list. This option is most important when Automatically add new words to suggestion list is enabled. This option keeps the list from becoming too cumbersome. You can select any value from 1 to 500.
Append space
If checked, it adds a single space to the end of a word after autocompletion, this means it is not necessary to add the space manually for the next word.
Key to accept suggestion:
Set the key you want to use when an autocompleted word is suggested to you and you want to accept it. You can choose Enter, Tab, Space, End or Right.
Make Default
A word is not part of autocompletion until the list is saved to disk. At that moment, & kpresenter; will use that saved list for all autocompletion, until the list is replaced with another saved list.
Some of the words in the autocompletion list may not have been saved yet.
To save the current list to disk and have & kpresenter; begin using this new list for autocompletion, click this button.
Click OK to save your options. Click Cancel to abort all changes. Click Reset to reset to the state after you clicked on the Make Default button.

Skip all uppercase words
If this option is checked, the all uppercase words will not be checked for spelling. This option is also used when you choose the Text Spellcheck Spelling... menu option.
This is useful if the document you are working on uses a large number of acronyms. If this box is left unchecked, most of those acronyms will be incorrectly marked. By placing a mark in this checkbox, & kpresenter; will not mark the acronyms as misspelled.
Skip run-together words
If checked, then concatenated words made of existing words are not spellchecked. This is useful in some languages. This option is also used when you choose the Text Spellcheck Spelling... menu option.
Examples of such words are shutout, cannot and blackout.
Checking this box will help prevent & kpresenter; from flagging website and email addresses for spelling errors. These addresses often contain words run together.
Ignore These Words
You can have here a list of words you want to ignore in all spellchecking.
Write a word in the field then click on the Add button to add it in the list. Once the word is added in the list, even if you click the Cancel button of the configuration dialog, it will stay in the list.
