Inserting Brackets
%PRODUCTNAME
Math, can brackets be shown separately so that the distance between them is freely definable?
You can set individual brackets using &quot; left &quot; and &quot; right &quot; , but the distance between the brackets will not be fixed, as they adapt to the argument.
Nevertheless, there is a way to display brackets so that the distance between them is fixed.
To accomplish this, place a &quot; \ &quot; (backslash) before the normal brackets.
These brackets now behave like any other symbol and the alignment is the same as with other symbols:
left lbrace x right none
size *2 langle x rangle
size *2 \langle x \rangle
