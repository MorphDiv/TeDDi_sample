Introduction
& kdiskfree; displays the available file devices (hard drive partitions, floppy and & CD; drives, & etc;) along with information on their capacity, free space, type and mount point. It also allows you to mount and unmount drives and view them in a file manager.
& kdiskfree; is similar to the & kcontrolcenter; Disk-Free module, but takes up less screen space. It is useful if you want to keep a & kdiskfree; window available at all times.
Using & kdiskfree;
Starting & kdiskfree;
Type kdf at a command prompt or select Disk Free from the System group in the K menu. The standard & Qt; and & kde; command options are available, and can be listed by entering kdf --help at the command prompt.
The Main window
The main & kdiskfree; window displays the available file devices.
Normally, the following pieces of information are included:
kdiskfree; Screen
kdiskfree; Screen
an icon depicting the type of storage
device name
filesystem type
total size
mount point
free disk space
the percentage of space used as a number and as a graph.
In the picture above, four devices are shown: one reiserfs-formatted hard drive partition mounted at the file system root (/), two & CD-ROM; 's, and a floppy drive.
Left clicking on the header of a particular column sorts the devices according to that variable. A second left click sorts in the opposite order.
Clicking on a row pops up a menu. If that device is not currently mounted, the Mount Device option is available. If the device is mounted, it can be unmounted by choosing Unmount Device. Selecting Open in File Manager opens a new window with a graphical view of the files on that device.

This dialog has two tabbed windows, General Settings and Mount Commands
General Settings
Click on the word visible or hidden to turn display of an data field on or off.
Change the update frequency by moving the slider. The value in the box on the left is the interval (in seconds) between updates of the & kdiskfree; display to reflect the current status.
The File Manager setting controls the command executed when the Open Filemanager popup menu item is selected.
There are also two check boxes. One controls if a file manager window will be automatically opened when a device is mounted. The other causes an alert window to pop up if a disk gets critically full.
Mount Commands
Allows the user to specify the mount and unmount commands for a given device, as well as the icon used to represent it. More information on these commands can be found on the man page for mount (type man mount at the command prompt).
