Diff Program
You can select a different diff program here. On Solaris the standard diff program does not support all the options that the GNU version does. This way you can select that version.
Select the format of the output generated by diff. Unified is the one that is used most frequently because it is very readable. The KDE developers like this format the best so use it for sending patches.
Output Format
Lines of Context
The number of context lines is normally 2 or 3. This makes the diff readable and applicable in most cases. More than 3 lines will only bloat the diff unnecessarily.
Number of context lines:
Format
General
& Treat new files as empty
This option corresponds to the -N diff option.
With this option enabled diff will treat a file that only exists in one of the directories as empty in the other directory. This means that the file is compared with an empty file and because of this will appear as one big insertion or deletion.
& Look for smaller changes
This corresponds to the -d diff option.
With this option enabled diff will try a little harder (at the cost of more memory) to find fewer changes.
Optimize for large files
This corresponds to the -H diff option.
This option lets diff makes better diffs when using large files. The definition of large is nowhere to be found though.
& Ignore changes in case
This corresponds to the -i diff option.
With this option to ignore changes in case enabled, diff will not indicate a difference when something in one file is changed into SoMEthing in the other file.
Ignore regexp:
This option corresponds to the -I diff option.
When this checkbox is enabled, an option to diff is given that will make diff ignore lines that match the regular expression.
Add the regular expression here that you want to use to ignore lines that match it.
& Edit...
Clicking this will open a regular expression dialog where you can graphically create regular expressions.
Whitespace
Expand tabs to spaces in output
This option corresponds to the -t diff option.
This option does not always produce the right result. Due to this expansion Kompare may have problems applying the change to the destination file.
Ignore added or removed empty lines
This option corresponds to the -B diff option.
This can be very useful in situations where code has been reorganized and empty lines have been added or removed to improve legibility.
Ignore changes in the amount of whitespace
This option corresponds to the -b diff option.
If you are uninterested in differences arising due to, for example, changes in indentation, then use this option.
Ignore all whitespace
This option corresponds to the -w diff option.
This is useful for seeing the significant changes without being overwhelmed by all the white space changes.
Ignore changes due to tab expansion
This option corresponds to the -E diff option.
If there is a change because tabs have been expanded into spaces in the other file, then this option will make sure that these do not show up. Kompare currently has some problems applying such changes so be careful when you use this option.

File Pattern to Exclude
If this is checked you can enter a shell pattern in the text box on the right or select entries from the list.
Here you can enter or remove a shell pattern or select one or more entries from the list.
File with Filenames to Exclude
If this is checked you can enter a filename in the combo box on the right.
Here you can enter the URL of a file with shell patterns to ignore during the comparison of the folders.
Any file you select in the dialog that pops up when you click it will be put in the dialog to the left of this button.

Cervisia diff viewer
This will compare URL1 with URL2
This will open URL1 and expect it to be diff output. URL1 can also be a '- 'and then it will read from standard input. Can be used for instance for cvs diff | kompare -o -. Kompare will do a check to see if it can find the original file(s) and then blend the original file(s) into the diffoutput and show that in the viewer. -n disables the check.
This will blend URL2 into URL1, URL2 is expected to be diff output and URL1 the file or folder that the diffoutput needs to be blended into.
Disables the check for automatically finding the original file(s) when using '- 'as URL with the -o option.
Use this to specify the encoding when calling it from the command line. It will default to the local encoding if not specified.
