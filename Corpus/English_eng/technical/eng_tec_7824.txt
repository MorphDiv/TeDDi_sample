ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Yttriga radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
1 ml sterile solution contains 0.1-300 GBq Yttrium (90Y) on the reference date and time (corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium [90Y]) (as Yttrium [90Y] chloride).
Each vial contains 0.1-300 GBq, corresponding to 0.005-15 micrograms of Yttrium (90Y), at reference date and time.
The volume is 0.02-5 ml.
The theoretical specific activity is 20 GBq/ microgram of Yttrium (90Y) (see section 6.5).
Yttrium (90Y) chloride is produced by decay of its radioactive precursor Strontium (90Sr).
It decay by emission of beta radiation of 2.281 MeV (99.98%) of maximal energy to stable Zirconium (90Zr).
Yttrium (90Y) has a half-life of 2.67 days (64.1 hours).
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
To be used only for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide.
Radiopharmaceutical precursor - Not intended for direct use in patients.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Yttriga is only to be used by specialists experienced with in vitro radiolabelling
Posology
The quantity of Yttriga required for radiolabelling and the quantity of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal product that is subsequently administered will depend on the medicinal product radiolabelled and its intended use.
Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
Method of administration
Yttriga is intended for in vitro labelling of medicinal products which are subsequently administered by the approved route.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not administer Yttriga directly to the patient.
Yttriga is contraindicated in the following cases:
- Hypersensitivity to Yttrium (90Y) chloride or to any of the excipients
2
- Established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6)
For information on contraindications to particular Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga refer the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The contents of the vial of Yttriga is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides or other substrates.
Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings and receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and appropriate licences of the competent authorities.
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared by the user in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements.
For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
Particular care should be taken when administering radioactive medicinal products to children and adolescents.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies of Yttrium (90Y) chloride with other medicinal products have been performed, because Yttriga is a precursor solution for radiolabelling medicinal products.
For information concerning interactions associated with the use of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Before administration of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal product pregnancy has to be excluded.
Alternative techniques which do not involve ionising radiation should always be considered.
Before administering a radioactive medicinal product to a mother who is breast feeding, consideration should be given to whether the investigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased breastfeeding.
If the administration cannot be delayed, a lactating mother should be advised to stop breastfeeding.
Further information concerning the use of a Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal in pregnancy and lactation is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Effects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelIed.
3 4.8 Undesirable effects
Possible side effects following the intravenous administration of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled a medicinal product prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga, will be dependent on the specific medicinal product being used.
Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
For each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely clinical benefit.
The activity administered must be such that the resulting radiation dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing in mind the need to obtain the intended therapeutic result.
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects.
The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations.
In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease itself.
4.9 Overdose
The presence of free Yttrium (90Y) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of Yttriga will lead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoetic stern cell damage.
Therefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of Yttriga, the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced by immediate (i. e. within 1 hour) administration of preparations containing chelators like Ca- DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the elimination of the radionuclide from the body.
The following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use Yttriga for labelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes:
- Ca-DTPA (Trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or
- Ca-EDTA (Calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate)
These chelating agents suppress yttrium radiotoxicity by an exchange between the calcium ion and the yttrium due to their capacity of forming water soluble complexes with the chelating ligands (DTPA, EDTA).
These complexes are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.
1 g of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 – 4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100 – 250 ml of dextrose, or normal saline).
The chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma.
However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does not preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency.
Intravenous administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours.
In any case the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions immediately taken if there is evidence of damage to the blood marrow.
The toxicity of the free Yttrium (90Y) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body during therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents.

{code} [pending]
The pharmacodynamic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/ package leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetic properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga, prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
In the rat, following intravenous administration, Yttrium (90Y) chloride is rapidly cleared from the blood.
At 1 and 24 hours, blood radioactivity decreases from 11.0% to 0.14% of the administered activity.
The two main organs where Yttrium (90Y) chloride distributes are the liver and bones.
In the liver, 18% of the injected activity is taken up 5 min after injection.
Liver uptake decreases then to 8.4% 24 hours after injection.
In bone, percentage of injected activity increases from 3.1% at 5 min to 18% at 6 hours and then decreases with time.
Faecal and urinary elimination is slow: about 31% of the administered activity is eliminated in 15 days.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The toxicological properties of Yttrium (90Y)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling with Yttriga prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.
There are no data available on the toxicity of Yttrium (90Y) chloride nor on its effects on reproduction in animals or its mutagenic or carcinogenic potential.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS
Before use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked.
Activity may be measured using an ionisation chamber.
Yttrium (90Y) is a beta pure emitter.
Activity measurements using an ionisation chamber are very sensitive to geometric factors and, therefore, should be performed only under geometric conditions which have been appropriately validated.
Usual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected.
7 The vial should never be opened and must be kept inside its lead shielding.
The product should be aseptically withdrawn through the stopper using sterilised single use needle and syringe after disinfecting the stopper.
Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken, complying with the requirements of Good Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Practice, in order to maintain the sterility of Yttriga and to maintain sterility throughout the labelling procedures.
The administration of radioactive medicinal products creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spills of urine, vomiting, etc.
Radiation protection precautions in accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
