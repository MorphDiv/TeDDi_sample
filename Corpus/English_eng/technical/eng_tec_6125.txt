Introduction
& kuickshow; is a comfortable image browser/ viewer. It displays a filebrowser where you can select images which are then shown.
The following image formats are supported:
jpg
gif
tiff
png
bmp
psd
xpm
ppm
pgm
pbm
pnm
eim
xcf
Images can be displayed either in their own window, as large as the image, or fullscreen.
Using & kuickshow;
Using & kuickshow; is very simple. The file browser lists files, which you can select with a & LMB; click or the Return key.
Here's a screenshot of & kuickshow;

More & kuickshow; features
The options dialog makes available more possibilities:
Images can be automatically shrunk to fit onto the screen, if they are larger.
You can configure whether images should show up in their own window, or always use the same window.
You can set the delay time for a slide show.
You can tell the browser which file types to show.
You can tweak the speed/ quality ratio
If you are looking for a certain file, just enter the first few characters of its filename in the browser. A small edit window will pop up in the bottom right corner. When a matching file is found, it is highlighted. You can leave the edit window by pressing Return or & Esc;.
The kuickshow; Configuration Dialog
The kuickshow; Configuration dialog contains 5 tabs. Three of them, General, Modifications and Slideshow configure the operation of & kuickshow;, and the other two, Viewer Shortcuts and Browser Shortcuts allow you to personalize the shortcuts for the respective windows.
General Options
The General contains the options to configure and tune & kuickshow;.
Fullscreen mode
If this is selected, images open in full screen mode. If the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the screen is filled with the background color selected below. The default is off.
Preload next image
If this is selected, & kuickshow; will load the next image in the folder, while you are looking at the current one. This reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is especially useful for slide shows.
Remember last folder
If this is selected, & kuickshow; saves the name of the last folder on exit. On next start & kuickshow; will open this folder in the browser window.
Background color:
Click on the colored bar to select a background color. This is used to fill the screen in fullscreen mode, or the window, if you have resized it larger than the image.
Show only files with extension:
You can configure & kuickshow; to only show you some of the file types it is capable of.

Indicates if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the image which is selected.
Delay between slides:

Iterations (0 = infinite):
