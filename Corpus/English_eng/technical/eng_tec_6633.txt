An example tile set
This image shows the six tiles in a tile set
Tiles three and four will be repeated over the game board and top row unless a full window background image is specified in the theme file.
TIP
PNG format is recommended for tile sets. The first, second, fifth and sixth tiles should contain some transparency if you want the background to show through. The third and fourth tiles should be solid, with no transparency, even if you'll be using a full window background image with your theme.
Tiles can be square or rectangular, and any size you like. Most of the tile sets that come with
For a full window background image, there's a bit more work to do. Let's say your tiles measure 50 by 50 pixels each. The game's display measures 7 by 7 tiles, including the top row, so the ideal background image for your tile set measures 350 by 350 pixels.

So, you now have a tile set and perhaps a background image to go with it. The next step is to put them in the right place.

The last step is to put your image(s) where
