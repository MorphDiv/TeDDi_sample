File Location Wizard
When files have finished being processed, they are saved based upon the File Location. Information about the track should be used within that text. There are eleven special words starting with a% that will be replaced with the corresponding track's information. Each of the buttons below will insert its replacement word into the File Location where the cursor is. Use at least one replacement string to make sure that the File Location is unique.
