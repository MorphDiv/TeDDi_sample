Service
The Service Manager module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the & kde; Daemon, also referred to as & kde; Services. Generally, there are two types of service:
Load-on-Demand Services
This is a list of available & kde; services which will be started on demand. They are only listed for convenience, as you cannot manipulate these services.
Startup Services
This shows all & kde; services that can be loaded on & kde; startup. Checked services will be invoked on next startup.
Be careful with deactivation of unknown services: some services are vital for & kde;; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.
