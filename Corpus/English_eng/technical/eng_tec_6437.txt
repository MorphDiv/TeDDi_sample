Introduction
The & mailody; Team welcomes you to & mailody;, a fast and friendly IMAP only email client for the K Desktop Environment. The goal of the & mailody; Team is to continue creating a client that is intuitive, fast, and powerful.
& mailody; is another email client, however it is not like every other email client. For starters & mailody; only works with IMAP email accounts, so if you are a POP3 user then you cannot use & mailody;. There are plenty of other features that makes & mailody; unique such as:
Small and fast - & mailody; does not use the default & kde; IMAP KIO, instead it uses a library written from scratch, designed for & mailody;, and optimized for speed and efficiency.
No Sent mail folder - & mailody; stores sent messages alongside the message replied or in the currently selected folder if not replying.
The composer window has a sidebar with tabs: Addressbook - Your & kde; addressbook. Add Attachment - Filesystem browser for attaching files. Recent - List of recently mailed contacts/ addresses. Click the tab once to show, and again to hide. You can also go from one tab to another. In the recent tab, if you hold your mouse over the address, you will get more information about the last time you mailed that address.
Dragging and dropping - & mailody; allows you to drag and drop files into the Composer window, automatically attaching the files to the email message.
Dropdown-buttons with frequently mailed contacts for New and Forward. In the main window of & mailody; you can hold down the icon for New and Forward to display a submenu with the email addresses you mail frequently and email addresses of the selected message.
You can hide deleted messages which are marked for removal and have not been purged from the message lists. However when you use the quick search bar at the top, it will search through all messages regardless of the hide deleted messages setting.
Replies to deleted threads, but not those that have been purged, will automatically display the deleted/ hidden message. To understand the deleted but not purged portion, please refer to the paragraph two items down.
Normally messages are sorted based on the date of the first message of the thread. & mailody; can also sort threads on the youngest children, which is the same as sorting threads based on the last received message. This eases the finding and viewing of older threads that may not be in view normally.
Like previously stated, deleting a message does not remove it 100%. Deleting a message totally is a two-stage process. Once a message is marked for deletion or removal, the next step or stage is to purge or expunge the message removing it permanently.
Reply to... either selected text or view source options. Replying to selected text occurs when you select text in a message, then choose reply, replying to the selected text only. Replying to view source occurs when you view the source of a message (view the source of a message by pressing V), then choose reply, you will reply to the source of the message, headers and all.
Labels can be applied to any message ranging from 1 to 5, or 0 (zero) to remove the label. Labels 1 through 5 color label a selected message and are stored on the IMAP server so when accessing your email with another client you will see the same tags. The colors match those of Thunderbird, so when working together with several people with different clients, it will all work together.
Clickable fields in the statusbar allow the toggeling of the message view properties. HTML; /Plain text and Load external/ Do n't load external are the two options. This allows you to switch between an & HTML; view and a plain text view as well as loading or not loading images from an external source when in & HTML; view.
Configuring or specifying non-standard port numbers can be achieved by adding a colon (:) in the Server fields in the Settings dialog. This can be used for both sending (SMTP) and receiving (IMAP) configurations. The following is an example: mail. mailody. net:587 The 587 is the port number to use to connect to the server.
& mailody; apos; s homepage can be located at. There you will find useful links such as the latest changes, debugging information, other documentation, as well as contact information.
The & mailody; team would like to thank you once again for choosing & mailody; as your email client, and we hope you enjoy using it as much as we do developing it.
Getting Started
This chapter is just a short introduction to & mailody; as well as its usage so you can start using it right away. More information on using & mailody; can be found in the Using & mailody; section.
& mailody; Installation
& mailody; apos; s installation is described in the appendix.
When starting & mailody; for the first time, you will be prompted to create your identity as well as establish your account information. After this information has been created, & mailody; will create a mailody. db file located in $HOME/. kde/ share/ apps/ mailody/. After initial configuration use Settings Configure & mailody;.... The configuration dialog consists of 2 sections: IMAP and Identities.
Setting up your account
The first section of the & mailody; configuration is the IMAP section. The IMAP section has two subsections or tabs, IMAP server and Misc..
The IMAP server subsection offers settings such as the address for your IMAP server, server security type (Safety), as well as your server authentication username and password.
Here's a screenshot of the & mailody; IMAP server settings
Screenshot
The Misc. subsection offers settings such as the address of your favorite website and the amount of time in between new mail checks. The default Favorite Website is. You can change this setting to a link you wish to display in the main window of & mailody; or leave it blank to display a blank page.
Here's a screenshot of the & mailody; Misc. settings
Setting your Identity
The second section of the & mailody; configuration is the Identities section. The Identities section has two subsections or tabs, General and Signature.
The General subsection offers settings such as the name of the identity, user's full name, email address, & SMTP; server, server security type (Safety), and authentication. Settings are straight forward, however you should refer to the settings provided by your service provider.
The Signature subsection allows you to use and configure a custom signature for the emails that you send.
Testing your Setup
To test your configuration, send yourself an email. To open up the dialog for a new email message select & Ctrl; N Message New. In the Recipient textbox, enter the email address you want to send a message to. Enter a subject, some sample text, and then press the Send button.
To check your email, select & Ctrl; L mailody; Check for Mail Now. If you receive the message that you just sent, then your configuration is correct. However if you do not receive a message or error message, make sure that your network connection is working and then recheck your configuration.
Using & mailody;

The Main Window
The main window is the window that appears upon starting & mailody;. By default the main window is separated into three panes.
Folders (on the left)
This pane contains a list of your IMAP server folders. To select a folder, simply click on it. The messages contained in the folder will display in the message list pane (upper right).
Message list (upper right)
This pane lists header information (subject, sender, date, and size) for the messages in the selected folder. Clicking on a header will open the message in the message pane (lower right).
Message pane (lower right)
This pane lists the body of the email message that is currently selected in the message list pane.

The Composer Window
The composer window is used to write new messages and can be opened via & Ctrl; N Message New or from the New Message button.
Screenshot of the & mailody; composer window
Composing a Message
To write your message, fill in the appropriate fields in the composer window. The following lists the sections within the composer window.
Left Taskbar
Address book
This lists all of the people in your & kde; address book.
Recent
This lists all of the people whom you have recently sent a message to.
Add Attachment
This lists your / home folder allowing you to select a file to attach to the message.
Main Components
Identity
This allows you to select the identity which you want the message to be sent from (drop down to select one of multiple configured identities).
Recipient
This text box allows you to manually type in the email address of the person whom you want the message to be sent to. Once you have typed out the address, press the Add button or press the & Enter; key. This will add the address to the list box below.
Subject
This text box allows you to enter the subject of your message.
At the very bottom of the window is the actual box where you will type in your message. After you have typed in your message press the Send button.
Spell Checking your Message
Spell checking in & mailody; is done automatically. When you misspell a word, & mailody; will automatically change the color of the font to red. Once you have completed typing your message, you can then right click in the message box and select Check Spelling.... This will take you through all of the misspelled words providing you with a list of correct possibilities, or you can manually type in your own correction.
Message Folders
On the left hand side of the main window is where your message folders are listed. You folders will more than likely be different than another users depending on how you have them setup on your server. Unlike POP3 clients, & mailody; gets its folder list from the email server itself.
Sending emails does n't place the email in the Sent folder
When sending emails, the message you sent will be stored in the folder you sent it from. So if Inbox is highlighted when you send an email, that is where your message will be stored. You can drag messages into the Sent folder if you would like to have them stored there, or highlight the Sent folder and then send your message.
As explained in the previous note, moving messages from one folder into another is as easy as dragging and dropping it to where you want it to go. Clearing message from a folder is just as easy, however just right clicking or highlighting a message and pressing delete does n't remove it from the folder, but marks it for deletion. After marking it for deletion you need to select Mailbox Remove the deleted messages. The following image shows what a message will look like if it is marked for deletion.
Screenshot of a message marked for deletion in & mailody;
Create Folders
If your server allows you to create folders from an email client, then you will be able to easily create new folders in & mailody;. To do so, right click in the white space of the folders pane and select Create new folder. You will be prompted to enter a name for the folder, and then to complete the process press the OK button.
Right click options
To activate the possible options for a folder, highlight with a right click and you will be provided a menu. The following are the possible list of options. Note that the Inbox does not contain the Rename folder or Delete folder options.
Mark all as read
Marks all messages in the selected folder as read.
Sync mailbox with server
Synchronize the mailbox locally with the mailbox on the server.
Remove the deleted messages
If you have marked one or more messages for removal, this option will remove them from the server.
Create new folder
If your server allows this option, you can create a new folder from within & mailody;. If you create a folder, remember to sync with the server to apply the changes.
Rename folder
If your server allows this option, you can rename a folder (except the Inbox). If you rename a folder, remember to sync with the server to apply the changes.
Delete folder
If your server allows this option, you can delete a folder (except the Inbox). If you rename a folder, remember to sync with the server to apply the changes.
Check for new mail
Does exactly as it says, it checks your server for new mail and displays them in the highlight folder.
Mark as trash folder
If you mark a folder as the trash folder, when you delete a message, instead of removing it totally from the folder, it will be placed into the folder you marked as trash.
& mailody; Configuration
The & mailody; configuration can be opened by going to Settings Configure & mailody;....

Mailbox Sort on youngest child
Sorts threads based on the last received message. Normally messages are sorted based on the date of the message. When the message receives replies it might be hard to find the reply, because it is a reply to a message in the past. Mailody has a solution for that. It can sort the messages based on the dates of the replies to the message. So you will get all threads with replies grouped together at the top or bottom of the list.

Questions and Answers
& reporting. bugs; & updating. documentation;
Will I ever be able to check my POP3 email with & mailody;?
We hate to say no, but this time we have to. & mailody; is strictly an IMAP client. For POP3 clients we highly recommend & kmail;, but at the same time we highly recommend you switch to IMAP, as it is without a doubt superior. You can easily check, read, and respond to email no matter where you are, and you can easily have multiple computers attached to a single IMAP account without having to setup synchronization.
Can I use my PGP or GnuPG key in & mailody;?
Not at this time. We will continue researching this and when the time comes for a great library for PGP and/ or GnuPG implementation, we will look at including this then.
Where does & mailody; save my settings?
& mailody; settings are stored in $HOME/. kde/ share/ config/ mailodyrc.
Where does & mailody; save my messages?
& mailody; does not save your messages. With any IMAP configured client, your messages are stored on the server itself. There is however a local cache which we use for speed reasons, it is located at $HOME/. kde/ share/ apps/ mailody/ mailody. db.
How can I import my messages from a POP3 account with & mailody;?
& mailody; will not import the messages directly. To import messages it would be best to review the documentation for your IMAP server, or with your IMAP provider. In some cases you do not need to configure anything for an IMAP server, after installing it just works and will show your local messages.
Are there any known bugs in & mailody;?
With any piece of software there are always going to be bugs. Unlike the proprietary world, with & mailody; as well as most open source projects, not only can you view the bugs, but you can also track the progress on the bug you are interested in. Bugs for & mailody; are tracked through the & kde; bug database located at. For reporting bugs you are advised to use the Help menu of & mailody;.
Can I setup multiple IMAP servers with & mailody;?
Not at this time. Bug #142049 is currently posted and tracking this exact issue.
Can I load attachments only on request with & mailody;?
Not at this time. Bug #142180 is currently posted and tracking this exact issue.
