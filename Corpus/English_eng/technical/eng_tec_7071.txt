(unnamed profile)
Mode of operation for color management.
The color profile of your (primary) monitor.
When enabled, GIMP will try to use the display color profile from the windowing system. The configured monitor profile is then only used as a fallback.
The default RGB working space color profile.
The CMYK color profile used to convert between RGB and CMYK.
The color profile to use for soft proofing from your image's color space to some other color space, including soft proofing to a printer or other output device profile.
How colors are converted from your image's color space to your display device. Relative colorimetric is usually the best choice. Unless you use a LUT monitor profile (most monitor profiles are matrix), choosing perceptual intent really gives you relative colorimetric.
Do use black point compensation (unless you know you have a reason not to).
How colors are converted from your image's color space to the output simulation device (usually your monitor). Try them all and choose what looks the best.
Try with and without black point compensation and choose what looks best.
When enabled, the print simulation will mark colors which can not be represented in the target color space.
The color to use for marking colors which are out of gamut.
