The filter is found in the image window menu under
Options
There are two groups of options, each controlling the highlight or the shadow, and a checkbox for the selection behaviour.

Highlight X/Y offset
The selection's left and top edge are painted with the highlight color. The highlight offset is the size (width or height) of the respective area. If offset is less than 0 (this is the default), the left (X offset &lt; 0) or top (Y offset &lt; 0) area will be colored. If offset is greater than 0, the right (X offset &gt; 0) or bottom (Y offset &gt; 0) area will be painted.
Highlight color
This is the color used to highlight the selected area. It defaults to white, but clicking on the swatch button brings up a color selector and you may select any other color.
Highlight opacity

Sparkle
Applying example for the Sparkle filter
Filter
This filter adds sparkles to your image. It uses the lightest points according to a threshold you have determined. It is difficult to foresee where sparkles will appear. But you can put white points on your image where you want sparkles to be.
This filter is found in the image window menu under
Parameter Settings

Sliders and input boxes allow you to set values.
Preview
Parameter setting results are interactively displayed in preview. Scroll bars allow you to move around the image.
Luminosity Threshold
The higher the threshold, the more areas are concerned by sparkling (0.0-0.1).
Flare Intensity
When this value increases, the central spot and rays widen (0.0-1.0).
Spike Length
This is ray length (1-100). When you reduce it, small spikes decrease first.
Spike Points
Number of starting points for spikes (0-16). It's the number of big spikes. There is the same number of small spikes. When number is odd, small spikes are opposite the big ones. When number is even, big spikes are opposite another big spike.
Spike Angle
This is angle of first big spike with horizontal (-1 +360). -1 determines this value at random. If a spot has several pixels within required threshold, each of them will generate a sparkle. If angle is positive, they will all be superimposed. With -1, each sparkle will have a random rotation resulting in numerous thin spikes.
Spike Density
This option determines the number of sparkles on your image. It indicates the percentage (0.0-1.0) of all possible sparkles that will be preserved.
Opacity
When you decrease Opacity (0.0-1.0), sparkles become more transparent and the layer beneath becomes visible. If there is no other layer, sparkle saturation decreases.
Random Hue
This option should change sparkle hue at random... (0.0-1.0)
Random Saturation
This option should change sparkle saturation at random... (0.0-1.0)
Preserve Luminosity
Gives to all central pixels the luminosity of the brightest pixel, resulting in increasing the whole sparkle luminosity.
Inverse
Instead of selecting brightest pixels in image, Sparkle will select the darkest ones, resulting in dark sparkles.
Add Border
Instead of creating sparkles on brightest pixels, this option creates an image border made up of numerous sparkles.
Natural, Foreground, Background Colors
You can change there the color of central pixels. This color will be added in Screen mode (Multiply if Inverse is checked). You can select between

Perspective
Example for the

This filter adds a perspective shadow to the selected region or alpha-channel as a layer below the active layer. You may select color, length and direction of the shadow as well as the distance of the horizon.
If necessary, the filter may resize the image. But it will not add a background to make the shadow visible.
You can access this filter in the image window menu through

Angle
The angle determines the direction of the shadow or the imaginary source of light, respectively. Values range from 0° to 180°, where 90° represents a light source just in front of the selection or layer. For angles less than 90°, the shadow is at the right side, so the light source is on the left. For angles greater than 90°, it's the other way round. Tip: think of the slider's handle as source of light.

Angle 15°
Angle 45° (default)
Angle 105° (90° + 15°)
Relative distance of horizon
This option determines how far away the imaginary horizon is. The
Value range is from 0.1 to 24.1, where 24.1 means (nearly)

Angle = 45°. Distance = 2.4. Length = 1.8.
In the example above, the yellow area is the selection the filter is applied to. The blue line at the top represents the imaginary horizon. The angle between the selection's ground-line and the red line is 45°. The length of the red line is 1.8 times the height of the yellow selection. Extended to the horizon, the length is 2.4 times the selection's height.
Relative length of shadow
With this option you can set the length of shadow with respect to the height of the selection or layer. In the above example, the red line represents the length of shadow, its length is 1.8 relative to the height of the yellow selection.
Value range is from 0.1 to 24.1, although the length of shadow must not exceed the

Length = 1.0 (default)
Length = 1.5

Radius
This is radius of the SuperNova center (1-100). When you increase the value, you increase the number of central white pixels according to r*r (1, 4, 9...).
Spikes
This is number of rays (1-1024). Each pixel in the nova center emit one pixel wide rays. All these rays are more or less superimposed resulting in this glittering effect you get when you move this slider.
