Similar to Red Hat's"tksysv ", but SysV-Init Editor allows drag-and-drop, as well as keyboard use.

Runlevel Menu
Services Menu
& Available Services
These are the services available on your computer. To start a service, drag it onto the Start section of a runlevel. To stop one, do the same for the Stop section.
You can drag services from a runlevel onto the trashcan to delete them from that runlevel. The Undo command can be used to restore deleted entries.
Runlevel & %1
Runlevel %1
These are the services started in runlevel %1. The number shown on the left of the icon determines the order in which the services are started. You can arrange them via drag and drop, as long as a suitable sorting number can be generated. If that's not possible, you have to change the number manually via the Properties dialog box.
Start
Stop
These are the services stopped in runlevel %1. The number shown on the left of the icon determines the order in which the services are stopped. You can arrange them via drag and drop, as long as a suitable sorting number can be generated. If that's not possible, you have to change the number manually via the Properties dialog box.

You have specified that your system's init scripts are located in the folder %1, but this folder does not exist. You probably selected the wrong distribution during configuration. If you reconfigure %2, it may be possible to fix the problem. If you choose to reconfigure, you should shut down the application and the configuration wizard will appear the next time %3 is run. If you choose not to reconfigure, you will not be able to view or edit your system's init configuration. Would you like to reconfigure %4?
Folder Does Not Exist

Do Not Reconfigure
You do not have the right permissions to edit your system's init configuration. However, you are free to browse the runlevels. If you really want to edit the configuration, either restart %1 as root (or another privileged user), or ask your sysadmin to install %2 suid or sgid. The latter way is not recommended though, due to security issues.
