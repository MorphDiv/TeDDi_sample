Things you might like but & kpresenter; does not yet do (and what to do about it)
Powerpoint Files. & kpresenter; does attempt to import & Microsoft; Powerpoint files but it does not always work perfectly. It depends on the Powerpoint file version and what is in the file. You can always import pictures for the background image and re-type any text. It's not the ideal solution, re-doing the entire presentation. However, just bear in mind that Powerpoint does not even attempt to read & kpresenter; files.
Taking notes or minutes. One piece of software allows you to make notes during the meeting and puts them into a word processor. If you are speaking, someone else should be taking notes. If you really must do this sort of thing, take a note pad and pencil.
