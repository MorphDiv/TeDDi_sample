EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
KEPPRA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Keppra?
Keppra is a medicine containing the active substance levetiracetam.
It is available as oblong tablets (blue:
250 mg; yellow:
500 mg; orange:
750 mg; white:
1000 mg), as an oral solution (100 mg/ ml), and as a concentrate to be made up into a solution for infusion (drip into a vein, 100 mg/ ml).
What is Keppra used for?
Keppra can be used on its own in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, to treat partial onset seizures (fits) with or without secondary generalisation.
This is a type of epilepsy where too much electrical activity in one side of the brain causes symptoms such as sudden, jerky movements of one part of the body, distorted hearing, sense of smell, or vision, numbness or a sudden sense of fear.
Secondary generalisation occurs when the overactivity later reaches the whole brain.
Keppra can also be used as adjunctive therapy in patients who already receive other anti-epileptic medicines to treat: • partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in patients from four years of age, • myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in patients from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, • primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (major fits, including loss of consciousness) in patients from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Keppra used?
When Keppra is used on its own, the starting dose is 250 mg twice a day, increasing two weeks later to 500 mg twice a day.
The dose can be further increased at two-week intervals according to the patient’ s response, to a maximum dose of 1,500 mg twice a day.
When Keppra is added to another anti-epileptic treatment, the starting dose in patients over 12 years weighing more than 50 kg is 500 mg twice a day.
The daily dose can be increased up to 1,500 mg twice a day.
In children aged four 17 years weighing less than 50 kg, the starting dose is 10 mg per kilogram body weight twice a day, which can be increased up to 30 mg/ kg twice a day.
The oral solution is recommended when starting treatment in children weighing less than 20 kg.

Keppra tablets may be taken with or without food and are swallowed with liquid.
The oral solution may be mixed in a glass of water before taking.
Keppra can be given as an infusion using the same doses at the same frequency when the use of the tablets or the oral solution is temporarily not possible.
How does Keppra work?
The active substance in Keppra, levetiracetam, is an anti-epileptic medicine.
Epilepsy is caused by excessive electrical activity in the brain.
The exact way in which levetiracetam works is still unclear but it seems to interfere with a protein called the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, which is found in the space between nerves (synapses) and stops the release of chemical messengers between nerve cells.
This helps Keppra to stabilise electrical activity in the brain and prevent seizures.
How has Keppra been studied?
The effectiveness of Keppra as an add-on treatment in partial onset seizures has been studied in three main studies in a total of 904 patients.
In these studies, Keppra at doses of 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 mg per day, was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) over 12 to 14 weeks.
All patients were taking at least one other anti-epileptic medicine.
Keppra has also been studied in 101 children aged four to 17 years, where it was compared with placebo.
In all studies, the main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in weekly partial seizure rate.
In myoclonic seizures, the effectiveness of Keppra was studied in 122 patients, who received either Keppra or placebo in addition to their normal anti-epileptic medicine.
The study lasted up to 30 weeks, and looked at the seizure rates before and during the study to see if they had decreased.
In primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures, the effectiveness of Keppra was compared with that of placebo in 164 patients aged between four and 65 years.
The study looked at the change in seizure rate between the start of the study and the 20-week period when the patients were taking their full dose.
The effectiveness of Keppra used on its own was studied in 579 patients, who received either Keppra or carbamazepine (another anti-epileptic medicine) for up to two years.
The study measured how many patients remained free of seizures for six months once they had reached their effective dose.
What benefit has Keppra shown during the studies?
As add-on treatment, Keppra was more effective than placebo.
For partial onset seizures, placebo treatment reduced the weekly seizure rate by 6.1% to 7.2%, while the reduction with Keppra at a dose of 1000 mg/ day was between 17.7% and 32.5%, depending on the study.
With Keppra at a dose of 2000 mg, the reduction was 26.5%, and with 3000 mg, it was 37.1 or 39.9%.
In the study in children, the reduction in weekly seizure rate was 43.3% in the group of children who received Keppra, and 16.3% in the placebo group.
For myoclonic seizures, 58.3% of the patients who received Keppra had at least a halving of the number of seizure days per week, compared with 23.3% of the patients who received placebo.
For tonic-clonic seizures, there was an average reduction in seizure rate of 28.2% in the patients taking placebo, compared with 56.5% in those taking Keppra.
However, there were too few children aged below 12 to support the use of Keppra for this type of seizure in patients below this age.
Keppra was as effective as carbamazepine in keeping patients free of seizures when taken on its own for partial onset seizures.
In both groups, 73% of patients experienced no seizures for six months once on an adequate dose.
What is the risk associated with Keppra?
The most common side effects with Keppra (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are somnolence (sleepiness) and asthenia (weakness) or fatigue (tiredness).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Keppra, see the Package Leaflet.
Keppra should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to levetiracetam or other pyrrolidone derivatives (medicines with a similar structure), or to any of the other ingredients.
Why has Keppra been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Keppra’ s benefits are greater than its risks as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy, as well as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures, myoclonic seizures in patients with

juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.
The Committee recommended that Keppra be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Keppra:
