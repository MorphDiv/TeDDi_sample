Creating OpenPGP Keys
OpenPGP is a non proprietary protocol for encrypting e-mail with the use of public key cryptography based on
Public key cryptography is a concept which involves the use of two keys: a

To create OpenPGP keys:
Use similar practices to generating a strong password when choosing a passphrase. The main difference between a password and a passphrase is that, in a passphrase, spaces are valid characters.

Encryption Type
This field specifies the encryption algorithms used to generate your keys.

This is the suggested choice as it will allow you to encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify as needed.
DSA
Will allow signing only.
RSA
Key Strength (bits)
This is the length of the key in bits. The longer the key, the more secure it will be, provided a strong passphrase is used. Conversely, performing any operation with a longer key will require more time than it would with a shorter key. Acceptable values are between 1024 and 4096 bits. At least 2048 bits is recommended.
Expiration Date
Sign your new key with your old one before it expires to preserve your trust status.
This is the date at which the key will cease to be usable for performing encryption or signing operations. 6 months is a reasonable time to set it to. You will have to either change the expiration date or generate a new key or subkey after this amount of time passes.

Properties
Fingerprint
The fingerprint is a unique string of characters that exactly identifies a key.
KeyID
The KeyID is similar to the Fingerprint. However the KeyID only contains the last 8 characters of the fingerprint. Most of the time it is possible to identify a key with only the KeyID, but occasionally two keys may have the same ID.
Type
Specifies the encryption algorithm used to generate a key. DSA keys can only sign. ElGamal keys are used to encrypt.
Created
Indicates the date the key was created.
Expires
Indicates the date the key can no longer be used.
Strength
A long key is not enough to make up for the use of a weak passphrase.
Indicates the length in bits of a key. In general the longer the key, the more security it provides.
Trust
Trust is an indication of how sure you are of a person's ability to correctly extend the web of trust. When you are faced with a key you have not signed, the validity of that person's key will be determined based on the signatures they have collected and how well or not you trust the people who have made those signatures. By default, an unknown key will require 3 signatures with marginal trust value or 1 fully trusted signature.





Enabling and Disabling Keys
When a key is enabled, it can be used to perform encryption operations. When a key is disabled, it cannot be used to encrypt to or verify signatures made by it.
A key can no longer be used to perform key operations after it has expired. Changing a key's expiration date to a point in the future re-enables it. A good general practice would be to have a master key that never expires and multiple subkeys that do and are signed by the master key.
User IDs
User IDs allow multiple identities and email addresses to be used with the same key.
Name (comment) &lt;email addressgt;
They usually take the form of:
Adding a User ID
Adding a user ID is useful when you want to have an identity for your job and one for your friends.

It should be of the form
Key Comment
The comment field can be used to place any additional information into the displayed name of your new ID. This information can be searched for on key servers.
Photo IDs
Photo IDs allow a key owner to embed one or more pictures of themselves in a key. These identities can be signed just like normal user IDs. A photo ID must be in JPEG format and is recommended to be no larger than 240x288 pixels.

OpenPGP Subkey Properties
Each OpenPGP key has a single master key used to sign only. Subkeys are used to encrypt and to sign as well. In this way, if your sub key is compromised, you don't need to revoke your master key.
ID
This is the identifier of the subkey.
Specifies the encryption algorithm used to generate a subkey.
