JDBC Connection
JDBC
database.
JDBC Examples
You can use a JDBC driver class to connect to a JDBC database from %PRODUCTNAME
.
The driver class is provided by the database manufacturer.
Two examples of JDBC databases are Oracle and MySQL.
The driver classes must be added to %PRODUCTNAME in Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME - Java.
Oracle database
You can use a JDBC driver to access an Oracle database from Solaris or Linux.
To access the database from Windows, you need an ODBC driver.
On UNIX, ensure that the Oracle database client is installed with JDBC support.
The JDBC driver class for the Solaris Oracle client version 8.x is located in the < OracleÂ client > /product/jdbc/lib/classes111.zip directory.
You can also download the latest version from the Oracle web site:
http://otn.oracle.com/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html
Data source URL
box, enter the location of the Oracle database server.
The syntax of the URL depends on the database type.
See the documentation that came with the JDBC driver for more information.
For an Oracle database, the syntax of the URL is:
oracle:thin:@hostname:port:database_name
hostname is the name of the machine that runs the Oracle database.
You can also replace hostname with the IP address of the server.
port is the port on which the Oracle database listens.
Ask your database administrator for the correct port number.
database_name is the name of the Oracle database.
Ask your database administrator for the correct name.
MySQL database
The driver for the MySQL database is available on the MySQL web site.
The syntax for a MySQL database is:
mysql://hostname:port/database_name
hostname is the name of the machine that runs the MySQL database.
You can also replace hostname with the IP address of the server.
port is the default port for MySQL databases, namely 3306.
database_name is the name of the database.
Data source URL
Enter the URL for the database.
For example, for the MySQL JDBC driver, enter &quot; jdbc:mysql:// < Servername > / < name of the database > &quot; .
For more information on the JDBC driver, consult the documentation that came with the driver.
JDBC Driver Class
Enter the name of the JDBC driver.
Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME
- Java
, and click the
Class Path
button.
After you add the path information, restart
%PRODUCTNAME
.
Test Class
Tests the connection with the current settings.
