PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Frozen suspension and diluent for injection.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Day-old chickens and 18 days embryonated eggs.
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
For active immunisation of chickens:
• To prevent mortality and to reduce clinical signs and lesions of Infectious Bursal disease.
The onset of protection is from 2 weeks and the protection extends to 9 weeks.
• To reduce mortality, clinical signs and lesions of Marek’ s disease.
The onset of protection is from 4 days.
A single vaccination is sufficient to provide protection during the risk period.
4.3 Contraindications
Vaccinate only healthy birds.
Do not use in birds in lay and breeding birds.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Apply the usual aseptic precautions to all administration procedures.
As a live vaccine, the vaccine strain is excreted from vaccinated birds and may spread to turkeys.
Safety and reversion to virulence trials have shown that the strain is safe for turkeys.
However, precautionary measures have to be followed in order to avoid direct or indirect contact between vaccinated chickens and turkeys.
2/ 21 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Wear protective gloves and spectacles during the ampoule thawing and opening operations.
Open ampoules holding them at arm’ s length in order to prevent any risk of injury should an ampoule break.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
None known.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in breeding birds and birds in lay.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy from the concurrent use with any other vaccine, except Merial attenuated vaccines against Marek’ s disease, Newcastle disease and Infectious bronchitis.
It is therefore recommended that no other vaccine than these should be administered within 14 days after vaccination with the product.
In the absence of specific studies, no other vaccine should be administered concurrently with the product by the in ovo route
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
4.9.1 Reconstitution of the vaccine
• Wear protective gloves and spectacles during the ampoule thawing and opening operations. • Remove from the liquid nitrogen container only those ampoules which are to be used immediately. • Thaw the contents of the ampoules rapidly by agitation in water at 25-30°C.
Proceed immediately to next step. • As soon as they are thawed, open ampoules holding them at arm’ s length in order to prevent any risk of injury should an ampoule break. • Once the ampoule is opened, draw up the contents into a 5 ml sterile syringe. • Transfer the suspension into the diluent (Do not use if cloudy). • Draw up 2 ml of the contents of the diluent into the syringe. • Rinse the ampoule with these 2 ml and then transfer the rinsing liquid into the diluent.
Repeat the rinsing operation once or twice. • Repeat the thawing, opening, transfer and rinsing operations for the appropriate number of ampoules to be reconstituted in the diluent; either 1 ampoule per 200 ml of diluent for subcutaneous administration, or 4 ampoules per 200 ml of diluent for in ovo administration. • The diluted vaccine prepared as described is mixed by gentle agitation so as to be ready for use.
It should be used immediately after the preparation (all of the diluted vaccine should be used up within one hour).
This is why the vaccine suspension should only be prepared as and when required.
4.9.2 Posology
One single injection of 0.2 ml per chicken at the age of one day, by subcutaneous route.
One single injection of 0.05 ml per chicken egg at 18 days of embryonation, by in ovo route.
3/ 21 4.9.3 Method of administration
The vaccine must be administered by subcutaneous route or by in ovo route.
For in ovo administration, an automated egg injection machine can be used.
The device should be proven to safely and effectively deliver the appropriate vaccinal dose.
The instructions for use of this device should be strictly followed.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
None known.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Zero days.
5.
