gODBCConfig - ODBC Data Source Administrator

User data source configuration is stored in your home directory. This allows you configure data access without having to be system administrator
Name
Description
Driver
User DSN
System data sources are shared among all users of this machine.These data sources may also be used by system services. Only the administrator can configure system data sources.
System DSN
These drivers facilitate communication between the Driver Manager and the data server. Many ODBC drivers for Linux can be downloaded from the Internet while others are obtained from your database vendor.

Tracing allows you to create logs of the calls to ODBC drivers. Great for support people, or to aid you in debugging applications.

Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC) was developed to be an Open and portable standard for accessing data. unixODBC implements this standard for Linux/UNIX.

About
gODBCConfig - Appication
The Application communicates with the Driver Manager using the standard ODBC calls.

The application does not care; where the data is stored, how it is stored, or even how the system is configured to access the data.

The Application only needs to know the data source name (DSN)

The Application is not hard wired to a particular database system. This allows the user to select a different database system using the ODBCConfig Tool.
gODBCConfig - Driver Manager
The Driver Manager carries out a number of functions, such as:
1. Resolve data source names via odbcinst lib)
2. Loads any required drivers
3. Calls the drivers exposed functions to communicate with the database. Some functionality, such as listing all Data Source, is only present in the Driver Manager or via odbcinst lib).
ODBCConfig - Drivers
The ODBC Drivers contain code specific to a Database System and provides a set of callable functions to the Driver Manager.
Drivers may implement some database functionality when it is required by ODBC and is not present in the Database System.
Drivers may also translate data types.

ODBC Drivers can be obtained from the Internet or directly from the Database vendor.

Check http://www.unixodbc.org for drivers
ODBCConfig - Database Systems
Perhaps the most common type of Database System today is an SQL Server

SQL Servers with Heavy Functionality

The Database System may be running on the local machine or on a remote machine. It may also store its information in a variety of ways. This does not matter to an ODBC application because the Driver Manager and the Driver provides a consistent interface to the Database System.
ODBCConfig - odbc.ini
This is the main configuration file for ODBC.
It contains Data Source configuration.

It is used by the Driver Manager to determine, from a given Data Source Name, such things as the name of the Driver.

It is a simple text file but is configured using the ODBCConfig tool.
The User data sources are typically stored in ~/.odbc.ini while the System data sources are stored in /etc/odbc.ini
ODBCConfig
This is the program you are using now. This program allows the user to easily configure ODBC.
ODBCConfig - odbcinst.ini
odbcinst.ini contains a list of all installed ODBC Drivers. Each entry also contains some information about the driver such as the file name(s) of the driver.

An entry should be made when an ODBC driver is installed and removed when the driver is uninstalled. This can be done using ODBCConfig or the odbcinst command tool.
