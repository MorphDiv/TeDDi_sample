Using AutoText in Network Installations
You can store AutoText entries in different directories on a network.
For example, you can store &quot; read-only &quot; AutoText entries for your company on a central server, and user-defined AutoText entries in a local directory.
The paths for the AutoText directories can be edited in the configuration.
Two directories are listed here.
The first entry is on the server installation and the second entry is in the user directory.
If there are two AutoText entries with the same name in both directories, the entry from the user directory is used.
