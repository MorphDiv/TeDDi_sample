GNOME Sudoku
GNOME Sudoku has a simple, unobstrusive interface with all the features that make playing Sudoku fun. Games are automatically saved when you quit, and you can always come back to any game that you've played.
Each game is assigned a difficulty similar to those given by newspapers and websites. You can also see detailed information about how the computer solved the puzzle.
If you like to play on paper, you can print games out. You can choose how many games you want to print per page and what difficulty of games you want to print: as a result, GNOME Sudoku can act a renewable Sudoku book for you.
