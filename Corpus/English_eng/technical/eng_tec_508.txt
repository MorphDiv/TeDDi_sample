Shadow style
You can also apply a shadow effect to borders.
For the best results, only apply this effect when all four borders are visible.
Graphics or objects that are anchored to a frame in the document cannot exceed the size of the frame.
If you apply a shadow to the borders of an object that fills an entire frame, the size of the object is reduced to display the shadows.
Position
Click a shadow style for the selected borders.
Distance
Enter the width of the shadow.
Colour
Select a colour for the shadow.
Properties
Specifies the properties for the current paragraph or the selected paragraphs.
Merge with next paragraph
Merges the border style and the shadow style of the current paragraph with the next paragraph.
These styles are only merged if the indent, border, and shadow styles of the next paragraph are the same as the current paragraph.
This option is also available for Paragraph Styles.
Merge adjacent line styles
Merges two different border styles of adjacent cells in a Writer table into one border style.
This property is valid for a whole table in a Writer document.
The rules can be condensed to the statement that the stronger attribute wins.
If, for example, one cell has a red border of 2 point width, and the adjacent cell has a blue border of 3 point width, then the common border between these two cells will be blue with 3 point width.
