Introduction
This is the administrator's manual for & kappname;, the integrated solution to your personal information management (PIM;) needs. This document is intended to aid the groupware administrator with typical tasks needed to setup & kappname; and make it work smoothly in various environments.
& kappname; combines well-known & kde; applications like & kmail;, & korganizer; and & kaddressbook; into a single interface to provide easy access to mail, scheduling, address book and other & PIM; functionality.
Compatibility Issues
This chapter provides help with how to make & kappname; communicate effectively with various groupware solutions.
Outlook and Exchange
In the & kappname; configuration dialog, under Misc- > Groupware... you will find the following options that will help the user communicate with Microsoft Outlook(tm) running in a Kolab environment or in a Microsoft Exchange(tm) environment.
Mangle From: / To: headers in replies to invitations
Enable this option to make Microsoft Outlook(tm) understand your answers to invitations replies.
Microsoft Outlook has a number of shortcomings in its implementation of the iCalendar standard; this option works around one of them. If you have problems with Outlook users not being able to get your replies, try setting this option.
Details: When mailing an iCal invitation this makes the message have the From: header that is the same as the To: header. It also sets header X-KMail-Identity to the To's UIOD and makes sure the BCC: is blank. Outlook will only understand the reply if the From: header is the same as the To: header of the invitation message.
Send invitations in the mail body
Invitations are normally sent as attachments to a mail. This switch changes the invitation mails to be sent in the text of the mail instead; this is necessary to send invitations and replies to Microsoft Outlook. But, when you do this, you no longer get descriptive text that mail programs can read; so, to people who have email programs that do not understand the invitations, the resulting messages look very odd. People that have email programs that do understand invitations will still be able to work with this.
Details: When mailing an iCal invitation this option makes the message body from the attachment data and sets the Content-Type header to'text/ calendar; method=something; charset="utf-8 "'.
Auto-sending is also turned-on so there is no human intevention required for composing.
Encryption and self-signing are disabled.
Exchange compatible invitations naming
Microsoft Outlook, when used in combination with a Microsoft Exchange server, has a problem understanding standards-compliant groupware e-mail. Enable this option to send groupware invitations in a way that Microsoft Exchange understands. The invitation will be sent as an attachment with name ical. ics.
Details: When mailing an iCal invitation this makes the message have the subject "(Declined|Tentative|Accepted|Delegated): subject". The invitation will be sent as an attachment with name ical. ics.
Outlook compatible invitation reply comments
When the user provides comments when responding to invitations, send the comment in way that Microsoft Outlook(tm) understands. If this option is not enabled, the response comments will not be seen in Outlook.
Details: Comments when answering the invititation will be sent as a DESCRIPTION iCal property instead of the COMMENT iCal property (in violation of RFC2446).
Behavioral Issues
This chapter provides instructions on how to make & kappname; behave more like other groupware clients.
Composing Messages
Outlook users are accustomed to typing a list of addresses in the To:, CC: or BCC: fields separated by a semicolon (';') character in addition to a comma (','). By default, & kappname; only allows the comma as an address separator character. To also allow the semicolon, change the AllowSemicolonAsAddressSeparator from false to true in the installed share/ config. kcfg/ kmail. kcfg file.
RFC Compromises
& kappname; is designed to interoperate as well as possible with a wide variety of groupware solutions. To that end, we sometimes make design compromises with respect to the various Internet RFCs that provide the basis for low-level libraries on which & kappname; relies heavily.
We never knowingly violate any RFC.
The following list of RFC compromises is made by & kappname; or the low-levels libraries used by & kappname;:
When writing durations values into iCalendar files, & kappname; never writes the DURATION property in terms of weeks (i. e., 1*DIGIT "W"); instead, the integer number of weeks is always multiplied by 7 and written in terms of days (i. e. 1*DIGIT "D").
