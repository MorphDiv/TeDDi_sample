Cool artist - example audio file. wav
Audio CDs The Audio CD IO-Slave enables you to easily create wav, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis files from your audio CD-ROMs or DVDs. The slave is invoked by typing "audiocd: /" in Konqueror's location bar. In this module, you can configure encoding, and device settings. Note that MP3 and Ogg Vorbis encoding are only available if KDE was built with a recent version of the LAME or Ogg Vorbis libraries.

/ dev/ cdrom
Specify a location for the drive you want to use. Normally, this is a file inside the / dev folder representing your CD or DVD drive.
& Specify CD Device:
Uncheck this if you want to specify a CD device different from the one autoprobed
Use & error correction when reading the CD
If you uncheck this option, the slave will not try to use error correction which can be useful for reading damaged CDs. However, this feature can be problematic in some cases, so you can switch it off here.
