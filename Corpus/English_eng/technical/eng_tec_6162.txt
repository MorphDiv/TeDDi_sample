KOrganizer workshop: Outlook to vCalendar
Overview
When moving from & Microsoft; Outlookreg; to using & kde; 's & korganizer; to manage schedules and appointments, you will probably wish to export your scheduling data from Outlookreg; and import it into & korganizer;. & Microsoft; 's Outlookreg; program does provide an export option that can save an appointment to the industry standard vCalendar format.
Unfortunately, Outlookreg; will only export the appointment you have selected, one at a time. This is fine if you only wish to transfer a few appointments, but transferring the 200-300 appointments you may have in your Outlookreg; folder would not be much fun. Therefore, Randy Pearson created a small application named Outlook2VCal that can scan and export all the appointments to a vCalendar file at one time.
Installation
The Outlook2VCal 2.0 program is delivered as a compress ZIP file, which contains a SETUP. EXE application. Merely extract the files using your favorite utility, such as WinZip and run the SETUP. EXE program to install the program on your Windows computer. This should be the same computer where you normally run & Microsoft; Outlook 97reg;, 2000reg; or 2002reg;.
Depending on how up to date your system is, you may or may not be prompted to reboot during the installation.
Export Usage
After the program is installed, you can run it by accessing Start Programs Outlook2vCal Outlook2vCal. You should see this screen appear:
Outlook2VCal main window
Outlook2VCal main window
Outlook2VCal main window
The program automatically attempts to communicate with Outlookreg; using OLE Automation. If an error is reported, this probably means you do not have Outlookreg; installed.
You should first decide if you want to include information about holidays in the exported file or not. Normally you will probably not wish to do this, so the Skip Holidays box is checked by default. Next, click the Export button, which will display a standard File Save dialog box. Browse to the desired folder and enter the filename where you wish to create the new vCalendar data file.

Depending on the security settings in Outlookreg;, you may see this screen next. If so, be sure to allow access for a minute or two.

The program will display progress messages in its main window as it loads, converts and saves your appointments. Here is a final shot of what a successful run looks like:

Import Usage
Now that you have exported Outlook'sreg; appointments, the final step is to load the appointments into & korganizer;. Transfer the file over to the computer running & korganizer; (via network, floppy disk, whatever). Now, run & korganizer;. If desired, you can create a new calendar, or open an existing one.

& korganizer; will ask you if you want to Add as new calendar, which adds the calendar file as a new local file resource, Merge into existing calendar, which merges the calendar items into an existing resource or Open in separate window, which will allow you to view and edit the calendar, but will not add to its default view. To add the calendar items, select one of the two first options, and press OK.
After you select the OK button, & korganizer; will load the appointments from the file and update its calendar.

Limitations
The first version of this program (1.0) was tested on & Microsoft; Windows 2000 Serverreg; and Professionalreg; running & Microsoft; Outlook 2000reg;. When attempting to use & Microsoft; Outlook 97reg;, the program failed miserably.
The second (2.0) version, is reported to work (at least) with & Microsoft; Outlook 97reg;, 2000reg;, and 2002reg;.
If anyone has a work around for this problem, feel free to send a note to Randy Pearson (blueboy@bamafolks. com).
