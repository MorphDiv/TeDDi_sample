Introduction
What is a terminal?
& konsole; is an X terminal emulator, often referred to as a terminal or a shell. It emulates a command line interface in a text only window.
Explaining the use of the & UNIX; CLI is beyond the scope of this document. A search of the web for these terms will produce more information.
Scrollback
& konsole; uses the notion of scrollback to allow user's to view previously displayed output. By default, scrollback is on and set to save 1000 lines of output in addition to what is currently displayed on the screen. As lines of text scroll off the top of the screen, they can be reviewed by moving the scroll bar upwards, scrolling with a mouse wheel or through the use of the Shift; Page Up (to move back a page), Shift; Page Down (to move forward a page), Shift; Up Arrow (to move up a line) and Shift; Down Arrow (to move down a line) keys.
When the scrolllock is on, ordinary input and output from the shell is suspended, and you can scroll through the history with Page Up, Page Down, Up Arrow and Down Arrow.
& konsole; provides a number of actions located in the Scrollback menu.
Profiles
Profiles allow the user to quickly and easily automate the running of common commands. Examples could include:
ssh into another machine
starting an irc session
use tail to watch a file
Procedure to create a new profile:
Click on the menu entry Settings Manage Profiles...
Click on the button New Profile....
Fill in the first entry with a name. This is the name that will show in the menu, and will be the default label instead of Shell when you start a session of this type.
Enter a command just as you normally would if you opened a new shell and were going to issue that command. For our first example above, you might type ssh administration.
On the other tabs of the dialog, configure this session's appearance. You can configure a different font, colour scheme, $TERM type and many other settings for each session.
Press the OK button. The new session is now available in the Manage Profiles... dialog.
After creating profiles, they are listed by their name in the File menu underneath the default Shell item.
Mouse Buttons
This section details the use of the mouse buttons for the common right handed mouse button order. For the left handed mouse button order, swap left and right in the text below.
Left
All & LMB; clicks will be sent to a mouse-aware application running in & konsole;. If an application will react on mouse clicks, & konsole; indicates this by showing an arrow cursor. If not, an I-beam (bar) cursor is shown.
Holding the & LMB; down and dragging the mouse over the screen with a mouse-unaware application running will mark a region of the text. While dragging, the marked text is displayed reversed for visual feedback. Select Copy from the Edit menu to copy the marked text to the clipboard for further use within & konsole; or another application. The selected text can also be dragged and dropped into compatible applications. Click on the selected text and drag it to the desired location. Depending on your & kde; settings, you may need to hold the & Ctrl; key while dragging.
Normally, new-line characters are inserted at the end of each line selected. This is best for cut and paste of source code, or the output of a particular command. For ordinary text, the line breaks are often not important. One might prefer, however, for the text to be a stream of characters that will be automatically re-formatted when pasted into another application. To select in text-stream mode, hold down the & Ctrl; key while selecting normally.
Pressing the & Ctrl; and & Alt; keys along with the & LMB; will select a column of text.
Double-click with the & LMB; to select a word; triple-click to select an entire line.
If the upper or lower edge of the text area is touched while marking, & konsole; scrolls up or down, eventually exposing text within the history buffer. The scrolling stops when the mouse stops moving.
After the mouse is released, & konsole; attempts to keep the text in the clipboard visible by holding the marked area reversed. The marked area reverts back to normal as soon as the contents of the clipboard change, the text within the marked area is altered or the & LMB; is clicked.
To mark text on a mouse-aware application (Midnight Commander, for example) the & Shift; key has to be pressed when clicking.
Middle
Pressing the & MMB; pastes text currently in the clipboard. Holding down the & Ctrl; key as you press the & MMB; pastes the text and sends it to & konsole;.
If you have a mouse with only two buttons, pressing both the & LMB; and & RMB; together emulates the & MMB; of a three button mouse.
If you have a wheel as the middle button, rolling it in a mouse unaware program will move & konsole; 's scrollbar.
Right
These items appear in the menu when the & RMB; is pressed: Copy, Paste, Clear Scrollback & Reset, Open File Manager, Change Profile, Edit Current Profile..., Show MenuBar, Character Encoding and Close Tab
In a mouse aware application, press the & Shift; key along with the & RMB; to get the popup menu.
Command Reference

%n: program name
%d: current directory (short)
%D: current directory (long)
%w: window title set by shell
%#: session number
%u: user name
Examples:
%d: %n with / usr/ src as current directory and running bash will display usr/ s: bash
%D: %n with / usr/ src as current directory and running top will display / usr/ src: top
%w (%#) with ~ as current directory and running vim in the first tab will display [No Name] (~) - VIM(1)
Copy Input Dialog
The text entered in one tab can simultaneously be sent to other tabs. This dialog allows you to select which tabs will get that input. The current tab will be greyed out.

This document is the user handbook for the & konsole; application.
& UNIX; operating systems were originally designed as text-only systems, controlled by keyboard commands -- what is known as a command-line interface (CLI). The & X-Window; and & kde; and other projects have since added the graphical interface you are now using. However, the underlying CLI system is still there, and is frequently the easiest, fastest and most powerful way to perform many tasks.
& konsole; is what is known as an X terminal emulator, often referred to as a terminal or a shell. It gives you the equivalent of an old-fashioned text screen on your desktop, but one which can easily share the screen with your graphical applications. & Windows; users may be familiar with the MS-DOS Prompt utility, which has the analogous function of offering a DOS command-line under & Windows;. (Although the & UNIX; CLI s offer far more power and ease of use than does DOS!)
Explaining the use of the & UNIX; CLI is beyond the scope of this document, as it would require a lengthy book. Fortunately, many such books are available in every language in any good bookstore or library. There are also tutorials available on the Internet. Enjoy & kde;, but do n't be shy about learning to use the command-line! You will find that even learning just the basics will make your computer use much more efficient and enjoyable.
What makes & konsole; special?
& konsole; 's advanced features include simple configuration and the ability to use multiple terminal shells in a single window, making for a less cluttered desktop.
Using & konsole;, a user can open:
& Linux; console sessions
Shell sessions
Screen sessions
Midnight Commander file manager sessions
Root console sessions
Root Midnight Commander sessions
User created sessions
These sessions can be renamed to help you keep track of all your shells, or signaled (STOP, CONT, HUP, INT, TERM, KILL).
For more control over & konsole;, a user can:
hide/ show the menubar and/ or frame
select the size of a & konsole; window, fonts, color schemes, and key mapping
change location of the scrollbar or hide the scrollbar
change location of the tabbar or hide the tabbar
All chosen settings can be made the default for forthcoming sessions by saving them.
For those with a deep interest in the taxonomy of free X terminals, there are two others of this kind: xterm, the original, written even before X itself (a month or two), and xvt, a lightweight xterm clone, on which most other currently available derivatives (notably eterm) are based.
Startup
When & konsole; is started, an application (typically a & UNIX; shell) runs in the window. Simply type at the prompt.
konsole; Screen
konsole; Screen
& konsole; with 4 terminal sessions open.
A Tip of the Day window may also appear on startup, offering hints on the use of & konsole;. If you do not wish to receive tips, uncheck the Show tips on startup box.
History
Search Output...
Find Next
Find Previous
Save Output...
Clear Scrollback & reset
In & konsole;, references to history are to the text that is displayed in & konsole; 's window. The shell that is running in & konsole; (e. g. bash) also has a history which is unrelated to & konsole; 's history.
Sessions
If you often have to log into remote machines, or always run a similar set of terminal applications, you can use & konsole; 's Session feature along with & kde; 's session management to automate a lot of this for you. Let's take the following example: You often have open an ssh session to the machine administration ready for generic administration tasks. You may have noticed the New Session button on & konsole; 's tab bar contains a menu if you click and hold on it, and you can choose new session types here. We are going to add new entries to this menu.
You should now be able to press and hold the New Session button on the tab bar, and select your new session type from the list. A new shell session will open within the & konsole; window, with the result of your executed command. In our example, you will be at an ssh passphrase prompt, and when you provide your passphrase, you will be logged into the remote machine. You can avoid this step also, by using ssh-agent, but that is a topic for another goodie. Perhaps you want to remotely tail your http error logs on a webserver, you could use a commandline something like ssh -f webserver tail -f / var/ log/ httpd-error. log.
You can use this to execute local commands as well. Try creating a session where the command is tail -f / var/ log/ messages. In this case, exiting the running application will close the shell session as well.
One really nice use of this feature is if you find you always have the same set of open sessions, & kde; can open them all for you automatically when you start a new & kde; session. Simply have them open as you like when you exit & kde;, and they will be saved with your & kde; session, and restored just like any other application when you restart & kde;.
You can assign shortcuts to any session.
The items that appear in the menu when the & RMB; is pressed depend on whether the menubar is visible.
Menubar is visible: Set Selection End, Copy, Paste, Send Signal, Detach Session, Rename Session..., Bookmarks and Close Session menu items.
Pressing the & Ctrl; key and & RMB; brings up the Session menu.
The menubar is at the top of the & konsole; window. The menubar can be activated and deactivated by the Alt; key.
Settings Hide Menubar allows the menubar to be hidden. When the menubar is hidden, Show Menubar can be reached by right clicking in the window or by Alt; Ctrl; M, which is the default shortcut for activating the menubar. The menubar can also be toggled by assigning it a shortcut.
Open a new session with a terminal shell. Ctrl; Shift; N can also be used, as described in more detail below.
File New Window
Open a new & konsole; window. Ctrl; Shift; M can also be used to open a new & konsole; window.
File New Linux Console
Open a new session emulating a text-only & Linux; system.
See the file README. linux. console in the & konsole; source package for detailed information on how the & Linux; console differs from a typical & UNIX; console. If this does n't mean anything to you, you almost certainly do n't need to worry about it.
File New Midnight Commander
Open a new session with the Midnight Commander file browser.
This menu entry will only be visible if Midnight Commander (mc) is installed on your system.
File New Root Midnight Commander
Open a new session with the Midnight Commander file browser, as the root user.
After being prompted for the root password, the # prompt appears under the browser window, indicating that the user is working with root privileges. Again, working as root is frequently necessary but care should be taken to avoid accidental damage.
File New Root Shell
Open a new session with a terminal shell, as the root user.
After being prompted for the root password, the # prompt appears, indicating that the user is working with root privileges. This is frequently necessary for installing new software and other system maintenance, but care should be taken to avoid accidental damage.
File New Screen Session
Open a new session with the Screen virtual terminal manager. See man screen for more information.
This menu entry will only be visible if Screen (screen) is installed on your system.
File Quit
Quit & konsole;, closing all sessions and any applications launched from them.
You can also open a new session with a key shortcut. By default, Ctrl; Shift; N is used. You can also define your own key shortcuts through the Settings Configure Shortcuts... menu command.
The list of available sessions will reflect what programs are installed along with any user defined sessions. The session list will be alphabetized for quick viewing.
Finally, note that the session types can be modified, and new types created, by using the configuration dialog, reached from the Settings Manage Profiles... menu entry.
Edit Send Input to All
Flag the current session so any commands entered into it will be sent to all sessions. The session will have a small icon in its tab to remind you to be careful of what you enter! rm -rf *, for instance, is probably not a good idea.
Edit Send Signal
Send Signal - Send the specified signal to the shell process, or other process, that was launched when the new session was started.
Currently available signals are:
STOP
to stop process
CONT
continue if stopped
HUP
hangup detected on controlling terminal, or death of controlling process
INT
interrupt from keyboard
TERM
KILL
kill signal
USR1
user signal 1
USR2
user signal 2
Refer to your system manual pages for further details by giving the command man 7 signal.
Alt; Ctrl; U Edit...
Send a file via ZModem.

Flag the current session so it will show an alert if no activity occurs for 10 seconds. An icon of a dark light bulb will appear in the session's tab. Use this to alert you if a task stops while you are working in another session. The time before an alert can be modified in the & konsole; preferences.
Flag the current session so it will show an alert if activity occurs. An icon of a lit light bulb will appear in the session's tab. Use this to alert you if something happens while you are working in another session. The time before an alert can be modified in the & konsole; preferences.
