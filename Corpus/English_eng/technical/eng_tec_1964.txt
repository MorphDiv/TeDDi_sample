Using Captions
In text documents, you can add continuously numbered captions to graphics, tables, frames, and drawing objects.
You can edit the text and the number ranges for different types of captions.
When you add a caption to a picture or to an object, the object and the caption text are placed together in a new frame.
When you add a caption to a table, the caption text is inserted as a paragraph next to the table.
When you add a caption to a frame, the caption text is added to the text inside the frame, either before or after the existing text.
To move both the object and the caption, drag the frame that contains these items.
To update the caption numbering after you move the frame, press F9.
To define a caption proceed as follows:
Select the item that you want to add a caption to.
Insert - Caption
.
OK
.
If you want, you can also enter different text in the
Category
box, for example
Figure
.
You can edit caption text directly in the document.
A caption is formatted with the paragraph style that matches the name of the caption category.
For example, if you insert a &quot; Table &quot; caption, the &quot; Table &quot; paragraph style is applied to the caption text.
