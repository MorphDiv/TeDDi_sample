Input/ Output Port Information
This page displays information about the I/ O ports.
I/ O Ports are memory addresses used by the processor for direct communication with a device that has sent an interrupt signal to the processor.
The exchange of commands or data between the processor and the device takes place through the I/ O port address of the device, which is a hexadecimal number. No two devices can share the same I/ O port. Many devices use multiple I/ O port addresses, which are expressed as a range of hexadecimal numbers.
The exact information displayed is system-dependent. On some systems, I/ O port information can not yet be displayed.
On & Linux;, this information is read from / proc/ ioports which is only available if the / proc pseudo-filesystem is compiled into the kernel. A list of all currently-registered I/ O port regions that are in use is shown.
The first column is the I/ O port (or the range of I/ O ports), the second column identifies the device that uses these I/ O ports.
The user cannot modify any settings on this page.
