Ignore extended PSD (located in the ISO-9660 filesystem under ` / EXT/ PSD_X. VCD ') and use the standard PSD.
Assume a 2336-byte sector mode
This option only makes sense if you are reading from a BIN CD disk image. This indicates to ` vcdxrip 'to assume a 2336-byte sector mode for image file. Note: This option is slated to disappear.
Create XML description file.
This option creates an XML description file with all video CD information. This file will always contain all of the information. Example: If you only extract sequences, the description file will also hold the information for files and segments. The filename is the same as the video CD name, with a. xml extension. The default is VIDEOCD. xml.

Maximal number of read retries
This specifies the maximum number of retries to read a sector of audio data from the cd. After that K3b will either skip the sector if the Ignore Read Errors option is enabled or stop the process.
Do not read the pregaps at the end of every track
If this option is checked K3b will not rip the audio data in the pregaps. Most audio tracks contain an empty pregap which does not belong to the track itself. Although the default behavior of nearly all ripping software is to include the pregaps for most CDs, it makes more sense to ignore them. In any case, when creating a K3b audio project, the pregaps will be regenerated.

Disable the source drive's error correction
Copy CD-Text from the source CD if available.
If this option is checked K3b will disable the source drive's ECC/ EDC error correction. This way sectors that are unreadable by intention can be read. This may be useful for cloning CDs with copy protection based on corrupted sectors.
If this option is checked K3b will search for CD-Text on the source CD. Disable it if your CD drive has problems with reading CD-Text or you want to stick to Cddb info.
If this option is checked and K3b is not able to read a data sector from the source medium it will be replaced with zeros on the resulting copy.
This is the normal copy mode for DVD, Blu-ray, and most CD media types. It allows copying Audio CDs, multi and single session Data Media, and Enhanced Audio CDs (an Audio CD containing an additional data session). For VideoCDs please use the CD Cloning mode.
In CD Cloning mode K3b performs a raw copy of the CD. That means it does not care about the content but simply copies the CD bit by bit. It may be used to copy VideoCDs or CDs which contain erroneous sectors. Caution: Only single session CDs can be cloned.

Image types supported by K3b: Plain imagePlain images are written as is to the medium using a single data track. Typical plain images are iso images as created by K3b's data project. Cue/ bin imagesCue/ bin images consist of a cue file describing the table of contents of the medium and an image file which contains the actual data. The data will be written to the medium according to the cue file. Audio Cue imageAudio cue images are a special kind of cue/ bin image containing an image of an audio CD. The actual audio data can be encoded using any audio format supported by K3b. Audio cue files can also be imported into K3b audio projects which allows to change the order and add or remove tracks. Cdrecord clone imagesK3b creates a cdrecord clone image of a single-session CD when copying a CD in clone mode. These images can be reused here. Cdrdao TOC filesK3b supports writing cdrdao's own image format, the toc files.
The actual file size does not match the size declared in the file header. If it has been downloaded make sure the download is complete. Only continue if you know what you are doing.

Force formatting of empty DVDs
If this option is checked K3b will format a DVD-RW even if it is empty. It may also be used to force K3b to format a DVD+RW, BD-RE or a DVD-RW in restricted overwrite mode. Caution: It is not recommended to format a DVD often as it may become unusable after only 10-20 reformat procedures. DVD+RW and BD-RE media only needs to be formatted once. After that it just needs to be overwritten. The same applies to DVD-RW in restricted overwrite mode.
Try to perform quick formatting
If this option is checked K3b will tell the writer to perform a quick format. Erasing a rewritable medium completely can take a very long time and some writers perform a full format even if quick format is enabled.

Solution
No optical drive found.
K3b did not find any optical device in your system.
Make sure HAL daemon is running, it is used by K3b for finding devices.
No CD/ DVD/ BD writer found.
K3b did not find an optical writing device in your system. Thus, you will not be able to burn CDs or DVDs. However, you can still use other K3b features such as audio track extraction, audio transcoding or ISO9660 image creation.
Unable to find %1 executable
K3b uses cdrecord to actually write CDs.
Install the cdrtools package which contains cdrecord.
Used %1 version %2 is outdated
Although K3b supports all cdrtools versions since 1.10 it is highly recommended to at least use version 2.0.
Install a more recent version of the cdrtools.
%1 will be run with root privileges on kernel > = 2.6.8
Since Linux kernel 2.6.8 %1 will not work when run suid root for security reasons anymore.
Click "Modify Permissions..." to solve this problem.
%1 will be run without root privileges
It is highly recommended to configure cdrecord to run with root privileges, as then cdrecord runs with high priority that increases the overall stability of the burning process. As well as this, it allows the size of the burning buffer to be changed, and a lot of user problems can be solved this way.
K3b uses cdrdao to actually write CDs.
Install the cdrdao package.
It is highly recommended to configure cdrdao to run with root privileges to increase the overall stability of the burning process.
K3b uses growisofs to actually write DVDs. Without growisofs you will not be able to write DVDs. Make sure to install at least version 5.10.
Install the dvd+rw-tools package.
K3b needs at least growisofs version 5.10 to write DVDs. All older versions will not work and K3b will refuse to use them.
Install a more recent version of %1.
K3b will not be able to copy DVDs on-the-fly or write a DVD+RW in multiple sessions using a growisofs version older than 5.12.
It is highly recommended to use growisofs 7.0 or higher. K3b will not be able to write a DVD+RW in multiple sessions using a growisofs version older than 7.0.
K3b uses dvd+rw-format to format DVD-RWs and DVD+RWs.
K3b needs at least mkisofs version 1.14. Older versions may introduce problems when creating data projects.
Device %1 - %2 is automounted.
K3b is not able to unmount automounted devices. Thus, especially DVD+RW rewriting might fail. There is no need to report this as a bug or feature wish; it is not possible to solve this problem from within K3b.
Replace the automounting entries in / etc/ fstab with old-fashioned ones or use a user-space mounting solution like pmount or ivman.
No ATAPI writing support in kernel
Your kernel does not support writing without SCSI emulation but there is at least one writer in your system not configured to use SCSI emulation.
The best and recommended solution is to enable ide-scsi (SCSI emulation) for all devices. This way you will not have any problems. Be aware that you may still enable DMA on ide-scsi emulated drives.
%1 %2 does not support ATAPI
The configured version of %1 does not support writing to ATAPI devices without SCSI emulation and there is at least one writer in your system not configured to use SCSI emulation.
The best and recommended solution is to enable ide-scsi (SCSI emulation) for all devices. This way you will not have any problems. Or you install (or select as the default) a more recent version of %1.
Install cdrdao > = 1.1.8 which supports writing to ATAPI devices directly.
The best, and recommended, solution is to use ide-scsi (SCSI emulation) for all writer devices: this way you will not have any problems; or, you can install (or select as the default) a more recent version of %1.
K3b will not be able to write DVD-R Dual Layer media using a growisofs version older than 6.0.
Install a more recent version of growisofs.
No write access to device %1
K3b needs write access to all the devices to perform certain tasks. Without it you might encounter problems with %1 - %2
Make sure you have write access to %1. In case you are not using devfs or udev click "Modify Permissions..." and setup permissions by hand.
DMA disabled on device %1 - %2
With most modern CD/ DVD/ BD devices enabling DMA highly increases read/ write performance. If you experience very low writing speeds this is probably the cause.
Enable DMA temporarily as root with'hdparm -d 1 %1 '.
User parameters specified for external program %1
Sometimes it may be necessary to specify user parameters in addition to the parameters generated by K3b. This is simply a warning to make sure that these parameters are really wanted and will not be part of some bug report.
To remove the user parameters for the external program %1 open the K3b settings page'Programs' and choose the tab'User Parameters'.
MP3 Audio Decoder plugin not found.
K3b could not load or find the MP3 decoder plugin. This means that you will not be able to create Audio CDs from MP3 files. Many Linux distributions do not include MP3 support for legal reasons.
To enable MP3 support, please install the MAD MP3 decoding library as well as the K3b MAD MP3 decoder plugin (the latter may already be installed but not functional due to the missing libmad). Some distributions allow installation of MP3 support via an online update tool.
System locale charset is ANSI_X3.4-1968
Your system's locale charset (i. e. the charset used to encode filenames) is set to ANSI_X3.4-1968. It is highly unlikely that this has been done intentionally. Most likely the locale is not set at all. An invalid setting will result in problems when creating data projects.
To properly set the locale charset make sure the LC_* environment variables are set. Normally the distribution setup tools take care of this.
Running K3b as root user
It is not recommended to run K3b under the root user account. This introduces unnecessary security risks.
Run K3b from a proper user account and setup the device and external tool permissions appropriately.
The latter can be done via "Modify Permissions...".

Caution: Make sure your system is able to send the data fast enough to prevent buffer underruns.
K3b uses the command line tools cdrecord, growisofs, and cdrdao to actually write a CD or DVD. Normally K3b chooses the best suited application for every task automatically but in some cases it may be possible that one of the applications does not work as intended with a certain writer. In this case one may select the application manually.

If this option is checked additional GUI elements which allow to influence the behavior of K3b are shown. This includes the manual selection of the used burning tool. (Choose between cdrecord and cdrdao when writing a CD or between cdrecord and growisofs when writing a DVD/ BD. )Be aware that K3b does not support all possible tools in all project types and actions.
Each medium has an official maximum capacity which is stored in a read-only area of the medium and is guaranteed by the vendor. However, this official maximum is not always the actual maximum. Many media have an actual total capacity that is slightly larger than the official amount. If this option is checked K3b will disable a safety check that prevents burning beyond the official capacity. Caution: Enabling this option can cause failures in the end of the burning process if K3b attempts to write beyond the official capacity. It makes sense to first determine the actual maximum capacity of the media brand with a simulated burn.
If this option is checked K3b will automatically erase CD-RWs and format DVD-RWs if one is found instead of an empty media before writing.
K3b uses a software buffer during the burning process to avoid gaps in the data stream due to high system load. The default sizes used are %1 MB for CD and %2 MB for DVD burning. If this option is checked the value specified will be used for both CD and DVD burning.
If this option is checked K3b will not eject the medium once the burn process finishes. This can be helpful in case one leaves the computer after starting the burning and does not want the tray to be open all the time. However, on Linux systems a freshly burned medium has to be reloaded. Otherwise the system will not detect the changes and still treat it as an empty medium.
If this option is checked K3b will continue in some situations which would otherwise be deemed as unsafe. This setting for example disables the check for medium speed verification. Thus, one can force K3b to burn a high speed medium on a low speed writer. Caution: Enabling this option may result in damaged media.

If this option is checked K3b encodes the video titles in two passes. The first pass is used to gather information about the video in order to improve the distribution of bits in the second pass. The resulting video will have a higher quality using a variable bitrate. If this option is not checked K3b will create video files with a constant bitrate and a lower quality. 2-pass encoding results in a doubled encoding time.
Automatic & Video Clipping
Automatically detect the black borders of the video
Most Video DVDs are encoded in a letterboxed format. Letterboxed refers to black bars used at the top and bottom (and sometimes at the sides) of the video to force it into one of the aspect ratios supported by the Video DVD standard. If this option is checked K3b will automatically detect and remove these black bars from the resulting video. Although this method is very reliable there may be problems if the source material is exceptionally short or dark.

Preemphasis
Preemphasis is mainly used in audio processing. Higher frequencies in audio signals usually have lower amplitudes. This can lead to bad signal quality on noisy transmission because the high frequencies might become too weak. To avoid this effect, high frequencies are amplified before transmission (preemphasis); the receiver will then weaken them accordingly for playback.
& Copy permitted
Post-Gap:
Set the length of the track's post-gap
On an audio CD each track (except for the last) can have a post-gap. This does not mean that K3b adds an additional gap of silence to the track. This setting simply influences the display on a Hifi audio CD player. The part of an audio track that is marked as post-gap is counted backwards. This setting is irrelevant for most users as modern CD burners can put arbitrary audio data in the post-gap when burning in DAO mode. In other CD-burning applications the post-gap might be called the pre-gap. The pre-gap of track 2 is the same as the post-gap of track 1. Changing the post-gap does not change the length of the track. When writing in TAO writing mode (not recommended for Audio CDs) the post-gap will most likely be muted and on some burners forced to 2 seconds.

Additional background movies can be installed. However, this is not as simple as a few mouse clicks. The background movies are stored in the emovix shared data folder (mostly / usr/ share/ emovix or / usr/ local/ share/ emovix) under backgrounds. So to add a background one has to copy the file to that folder.

eMovix Boot Labels eMovix provides a variety of different boot configurations which can be selected at boot time via a boot label (comparable to Lilo or Grub). The many different boot configurations mainly influence the Video output. The default, movix, or MoviX labels start a general Vesa video driver. The TV labels can be used to direct video to the TV output of the graphic board. eMovix provides TVout drivers for different brands of graphic boards. The FB labels refer to configurations that start a Frame Buffer driver in different screen resolutions. The AA labels make eMovix output the video through the ASCII-Art library which displays the picture in text mode through the usage of simple ASCII characters. The hd label makes eMovix boot from the local harddisk instead of the medium. This can be used to prevent accidental starting of an eMovix medium. The floppy label makes eMovix boot from the local floppy drive instead of the medium.

Symbolic Links
Symbolic link handling in the project
K3b can create ISO9660 filesystems that contain symlinks if the Rock Ridge extensions are enabled (they are by default). You can change the way symlinks are handled in a K3b project. No Change Symlinks are used as they have been added to the project. Discard broken symlinks K3b will discard all symbolic links that do not point to a file inside the project. That includes all links to absolute paths like '/ home/ myhome/ testfile '. Discard all symlinks K3b will discard all symbolic links that have been added to the project; meaning that the resulting file system will have no links at all. Follow symlinks Each symbolic link in the project will be replaced with the contents of the file it is pointing to. Thus, the resulting filesystem will not contain any symbolic links. Be aware that in case Rock Ridge extensions are disabled (which is not recommended) symbolic links are always followed because ISO9660 does not support symbolic links. Caution: Symbolic links require Rock Ridge extensions.

& Generate Rock Ridge extensions
Add Rock Ridge extensions to the file system
If this option is checked, K3b will generate the System Use Sharing Protocol records (SUSP) specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol (IEEE-P1282). Rock Ridge extends the ISO-9660 filesystem by features equal to the UNIX filesystems (permissions, symbolic links, very long filenames,...). It uses ISO-8859 or UTF-16 based characters and allows 255 octets. Rock Ridge extensions are located at the end of each ISO-9660 directory record. This makes the Rock Ridge tree closely coupled to the ISO-9660 tree. It is highly recommended to use Rock Ridge extensions on every data CD or DVD.
Generate & Joliet extensions
Add Joliet extensions to the file system
If this option is checked, K3b will add additional Joliet extensions to the ISO-9660 file system. Joliet is not an accepted independent international standard like ISO-9660 or Rock Ridge. It is mainly used on Windows systems. Joliet does not allow all characters, so the Joliet filenames are not identical to the filenames on disk (as compared to Rock Ridge). Joliet has a filename length limitation of 64 chars (independent from the character coding and type e. g. European vs. Japanese). This is inconvenient, as modern file systems all allow 255 characters per path name component. Joliet uses UTF-16 coding. Caution: With the exception of Linux and FreeBSD, there is no POSIX-like OS that supports Joliet. So never create Joliet-only CDs or DVDs for that reason.
Generate & UDF structures
Add UDF structures to the file system
If this option is checked K3b will create UDF filesystem structures in addition to the ISO9660 filesystem. The UDF (Universal Disk Format) is mainly used for DVDs.
Other Settings
Preserve file permissions (backup)
If this option is checked, all files in the resulting file system will have exactly the same permissions as the source files. (Otherwise, all files will have equal permissions and be owned by root). This is mainly useful for backups. Caution: The permissions may not make much sense on other file systems; for example, if a user that owns a file on the CD or DVD does not exist.

CD-Text If this option is checked K3b uses some otherwise unused space on the Audio CD to store additional information, such as the artist's name or the CD title. CD-Text is an extension to the audio CD standard introduced by Sony. CD-Text will only be usable on CD players that support this extension (mostly car CD players) and software like K3b, of course. Since a CD-Text-enhanced Audio CD will work in any Hifi CD or DVD player even if the player does not support CD-Text explicitly, enabling it is never a bad idea (just remember to fill in the CD-Text information).

File Quality
Controls the quality of the encoded files
Vorbis' audio quality is not best measured in kilobits per second, but on a scale from -1 to 10 called "quality". For now, quality -1 is roughly equivalent to 45kbps average, 5 is roughly 160kbps, and 10 gives about 400kbps. Most people seeking very-near-CD-quality audio encode at a quality of 5 or, for lossless stereo coupling, 6. The default setting is quality 3, which at approximately 110kbps gives a smaller filesize and significantly better fidelity than. mp3 compression at 128kbps. This explanation was copied from the www. vorbis. com FAQ.

Sample rate:
The sample data encoding is signed linear (2's complement), unsigned linear, u-law (logarithmic), A-law (logarithmic), ADPCM, IMA_ADPCM, GSM, or Floating-point. U-law (actually shorthand for mu-law) and A-law are the U. S. and international standards for logarithmic telephone sound compression. When uncompressed u-law has roughly the precision of 14-bit PCM audio and A-law has roughly the precision of 13-bit PCM audio. A-law and u-law data is sometimes encoded using a reversed bit-ordering (i. e. MSB becomes LSB). ADPCM is a form of sound compression that has a good compromise between good sound quality and fast encoding/ decoding time. It is used for telephone sound compression and places where full fidelity is not as important. When uncompressed it has roughly the precision of 16-bit PCM audio. Popular versions of ADPCM include G.726, MS ADPCM, and IMA ADPCM. It has different meanings in different file handlers. In. wav files it represents MS ADPCM files, in all others it means G.726 ADPCM. IMA ADPCM is a specific form of ADPCM compression, slightly simpler and slightly lower fidelity than Microsoft's flavor of ADPCM. IMA ADPCM is also called DVI ADPCM. GSM is a standard used for telephone sound compression in European countries and is gaining popularity because of its good quality. It is usually CPU intensive to work with GSM audio data.

Channel Mode
Select the channel mode.
Select the channel mode of the resulting Mp3 file: Stereo In this mode, the encoder makes no use of potential correlations between the two input channels; it can, however, negotiate the bit demand between both channel, i. e. give one channel more bits if the other contains silence or needs fewer bits because of a lower complexity. Joint-Stereo In this mode, the encoder will make use of correlations between both channels. The signal will be matrixed into a sum ("mid"), computed by L+R, and difference ("side") signal, computed by L-R, and more bits are allocated to the mid channel. This will effectively increase the bandwidth if the signal does not have too much stereo separation, thus giving a significant gain in encoding quality. Mono The input will be encoded as a mono signal. If it was a stereo signal, it will be downsampled to mono. The downmix is calculated as the sum of the left and right channel, attenuated by 6 dB.

Encoder Quality
Choose the noise shaping & psycho acoustic algorithm.
Bitrate is of course the main influence on quality. The higher the bitrate, the higher the quality. But for a given bitrate, we have a choice of algorithms to determine the best scalefactors and huffman encoding (noise shaping). The quality increases from 0 to 9 while the encoding speed drops. 9 uses the slowest & best possible version of all algorithms. 7 is the recommended setting while 4 still produced reasonable quality at good speed. 0 disables almost all algorithms including psy-model resulting in poor quality. This setting has no influence on the size of the resulting file.

Enforce strict ISO compliance
If this option is checked, LAME will enforce the 7680 bit limitation on total frame size. This results in many wasted bits for high bitrate encodings but will ensure strict ISO compatibility. This compatibility might be important for hardware players.
Strict ISO compliance
Turn on CRC error protection.
If this option is checked, a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code will be added to each frame, allowing transmission errors that could occur on the MP3 stream to be detected; however, it takes 16 bits per frame that would otherwise be used for encoding, thus slightly reducing the sound quality.
Error protection
This dialog can be used to setup external command line applications as audio encoders. These can then be used by K3b to encode audio data (Tracks from an audio CD or the titles from an audio project) to formats that are normally not supported (i. e. no encoder plugin exists). K3b comes with a selection of predefined external applications that depends on the installed applications.

Please insert the command used to encode the audio data. The command has to read raw little endian (see Swap Byte Order) 16-bit stereo audio frames from stdin. The following strings will be replaced by K3b: %f - The filename of the resulting file. This is where the command has to write its output to. The following refer to metadata stored for example in the ID3 tag of an mp3 file (Be aware that these values might be empty). %t - Title %a - Artist %c - Comment %n - Track number %m - Album Title %r - Album Artist %x - Album comment %y - Release Year
Swap the byte order of the input data
If this option is checked K3b will swap the byte order of the input data. Thus, the command has to read big endian audio frames. If the resulting audio file sounds bad it is highly likely that the byte order is wrong and this option has to be checked.

Let K3b select the best-suited mode. This is the recommended selection.
Disk At Once or more properly Session At Once. The laser is never turned off while writing the CD or DVD. This is the preferred mode to write audio CDs since it allows pregaps other than 2 seconds. Not all writers support DAO. DVD-R(W)s written in DAO provide the best DVD-Video compatibility.
Track At Once should be supported by every CD writer. The laser will be turned off after every track. Most CD writers need this mode for writing multisession CDs.
RAW writing mode. The error correction data is created by the software instead of the writer device. Try this if your CD writer fails to write in DAO and TAO.
Incremental sequential is the default writing mode for DVD-R(W). It allows multisession DVD-R(W)s. It only applies to DVD-R(W).
Restricted Overwrite allows to use a DVD-RW just like a DVD-RAM or a DVD+RW. The media may just be overwritten. It is not possible to write multisession DVD-RWs in this mode but K3b uses growisofs to grow an ISO9660 filesystem within the first session, thus allowing new files to be added to an already burned disk.

This is the most basic Video CD specification dating back to 1993, which has the following characteristics: One mode2 mixed form ISO-9660 track containing file pointers to the information areas. Up to 98 multiplex-ed MPEG-1 audio/ video streams or CD-DA audio tracks. Up to 500 MPEG sequence entry points used as chapter divisions. The Video CD specification requires the multiplex-ed MPEG-1 stream to have a CBR of less than 174300 bytes (1394400 bits) per second in order to accommodate single speed CD-ROM drives. The specification allows for the following two resolutions:352 x 240 @ 29.97 Hz (NTSC SIF).352 x 240 @ 23.976 Hz (FILM SIF). The CBR MPEG-1, layer II audio stream is fixed at 224 kbps with 1 stereo or 2 mono channels. It is recommended to keep the video bit-rate under 1151929.1 bps.
About two years after the Video CD 1.1 specification came out, an improved Video CD 2.0 standard was published in 1995. This one added the following items to the features already available in the Video CD 1.1 specification: Support for MPEG segment play items ("SPI"), consisting of still pictures, motion pictures and/ or audio (only) streams was added. Note Segment Items::. Support for interactive playback control ("PBC") was added. Support for playing related access by providing a scan point index file was added. ("/ EXT/ SCANDATA. DAT")Support for closed captions. Support for mixing NTSC and PAL content. By adding PAL support to the Video CD 1.1 specification, the following resolutions became available:352 x 240 @ 29.97 Hz (NTSC SIF).352 x 240 @ 23.976 Hz (FILM SIF).352 x 288 @ 25 Hz (PAL SIF). For segment play items the following audio encodings became available: Joint stereo, stereo or dual channel audio streams at 128, 192, 224 or 384 kbit/ sec bit-rate. Mono audio streams at 64, 96 or 192 kbit/ sec bit-rate. Also the possibility to have audio only streams and still pictures was provided. The bit-rate of multiplex-ed streams should be kept under 174300 bytes/ sec (except for single still picture items) in order to accommodate single speed drives.
With the upcoming of the DVD-V media, a new VCD standard had to be published in order to be able to keep up with technology, so the Super Video CD specification was called into life 1999. In the midst of 2000 a full subset of this Super Video CD specification was published as IEC-62107. As the most notable change over Video CD 2.0 is a switch from MPEG-1 CBR to MPEG-2 VBR encoding for the video stream was performed. The following new features--building upon the Video CD 2.0 specification--are: Use of MPEG-2 encoding instead of MPEG-1 for the video stream. Allowed VBR encoding of MPEG-1 audio stream. Higher resolutions (see below) for video stream resolution. Up to 4 overlay graphics and text ("OGT") sub-channels for user switchable subtitle displaying in addition to the already existing closed caption facility. Command lists for controlling the SVCD virtual machine. For the Super Video CD, only the following two resolutions are supported for motion video and (low resolution) still pictures:480 x 480 @ 29.97 Hz (NTSC 2/ 3 D-2).480 x 576 @ 25 Hz (PAL 2/ 3 D-2).
This is actually just a minor variation defined in IEC-62107 on the Super Video CD 1.0 format for compatibility with current products in the market. It differs from the Super Video CD 1.0 format in the following items: The system profile tag field in / SVCD/ INFO. SVD is set to 1 instead of 0. The system identification field value in / SVCD/ INFO. SVD is set to HQ-VCD instead of SUPERVCD. / EXT/ SCANDATA. DAT is mandatory instead of being optional. / SVCD/ SEARCH. DAT is optional instead of being mandatory.
If Autodetect is: ON then K3b will set the correct VideoCD type. OFF then the correct VideoCD type needs to be set by the user. If you are not sure about the correct VideoCD type, it is best to turn Autodetect ON. If you want to force the VideoCD type, you must turn Autodetect OFF. This is useful for some standalone DVD players without SVCD support.
Rename "/ MPEG2" folder on SVCDs to (non-compliant) "/ MPEGAV". Enables the use of the (deprecated) signature "ENTRYSVD" instead of "ENTRYVCD" for the file "/ SVCD/ ENTRY. SVD".
Enables the use of the (deprecated) Chinese "/ SVCD/ TRACKS. SVD" format which differs from the format defined in the IEC-62107 specification. The differences are most exposed on SVCDs containing more than one video track.
though most devices will have problems with such an out-of-specification media. You may want use this option for images longer than 80 minutes
To allow the play of Video-CDs on a CD-i player, the Video-CD standard requires that a CD-i application program must be present. This program is designed to: provide full play back control as defined in the PSD of the standardbe extremely simple to use and easy-to-learn for the end-userThe program runs on CD-i players equipped with the CDRTOS 1.1(.1) operating system and a Digital Video extension cartridge.
Configuration parameters only available for VideoCD 2.0The engine works perfectly well when used as-is. You have the option to configure the VCD application. You can adapt the color and/ or the shape of the cursor and lots more.
Playback control, PBC, is available for Video CD 2.0 and Super Video CD 1.0 disc formats. PBC allows control of the playback of play items and the possibility of interaction with the user through the remote control or some other input device available.
Here you can specify that the folder SEGMENT should always be present. Some DVD players need the folder to give a faultless rendition.
An Access Point Sector, APS, is an MPEG video sector on the VCD/ SVCD which is suitable to be jumped to directly. APS are required for entry points and scantables. APS have to fulfil the requirement to precede every I-frame by a GOP header which shall be preceded by a sequence header in its turn. The start codes of these 3 items are required to be contained all in the same MPEG pack/ sector, thus forming a so-called access point sector. This requirement can be relaxed by enabling the relaxed aps option, i. e. every sector containing an I-frame will be regarded as an APS. Warning: The sequence header is needed for a playing device to figure out display parameters, such as display resolution and frame rate, relaxing the aps requirement may lead to non-working entry points.
According to the specification, it is mandatory for Super Video CDs to encode scan information data into user data blocks in the picture layer of all intra coded picture. It can be used by playing devices for implementing fast forward & fast reverse scanning. The already existing scan information data can be updated by enabling the update scan offsets option.
Viewing Restriction may be interpreted by the playing device. The allowed range goes from 0 to 3.0 = unrestricted, free to view for all3 = restricted, content not suitable for ages under 18Actually, the exact meaning is not defined and is player dependant. Most players ignore that value.
This option allows customization of Gaps and Margins.
This option allows to set the number of empty sectors added before the lead-out area begins, i. e. the number of post-gap sectors. The ECMA-130 specification requires the last data track before the lead-out to carry a post-gap of at least 150 sectors, which is used as default for this parameter. Some operating systems may encounter I/ O errors due to read-ahead issues when reading the last MPEG track if this parameter is set too low. Allowed value content: [0..300]. Default: 150.
Used to set the track pre-gap for all tracks in sectors globally. The specification requires the pre-gaps to be at least 150 sectors long. Allowed value content: [0..300]. Default: 150.
Margins are used to compensate for inaccurate sector-addressing issues on CD-ROM media. Interestingly, they have been abandoned for Super Video CDs. For Video CD 1.0/ 1.1/ 2.0 this margin should be at least 15 sectors long. Allowed value content: [0..150]. Default: 30 for Video CD 1.0/ 1.1/ 2.0, otherwise (i. e. Super Video CD 1.0 and HQ-VCD 1.0) 0.

File System PresetsK3b provides the following file system Presets which allow for a quick selection of the most frequently used settings.
The file system is optimized for usage on Linux/ Unix systems. This mainly means that it uses the Rock Ridge extensions to provide long filenames, symbolic links, and POSIX compatible file permissions.
In addition to the settings for Linux/ Unix the file system contains a Joliet tree which allows for long file names on Windows which does not support the Rock Ridge extensions. Be aware that the file name length is restricted to 103 characters.
The file system has additional UDF entries attached to it. This raises the maximal file size to 4 GB. Be aware that the UDF support in K3b is limited.
The file system is optimized for compatibility with old systems. That means file names are restricted to 8.3 characters and no symbolic links or file permissions are supported.

Be aware that it is not recommended to disable the Rock Ridge Extensions. There is no disadvantage in enabling Rock Ridge (except for a very small space overhead) but a lot of advantages. Without Rock Ridge Extensions symbolic links are not supported and will always be followed as if the "Follow Symbolic Links" option was enabled.
Rock Ridge Extensions Disabled
Be aware that without the Joliet extensions Windows systems will not be able to display long filenames. You will only see the ISO9660 filenames. If you do not intend to use the CD/ DVD on a Windows system it is safe to disable Joliet.

Data in second session (CD-Extra)
Blue book CD K3b will create a multisession CD with 2 sessions. The first session will contain all audio tracks and the second session will contain a mode 2 form 1 data track. This mode is based on the Blue book standard (also known as Extended Audio CD, CD-Extra, or CD Plus) and has the advantage that a hifi audio CD player will only recognize the first session and ignore the second session with the data track. If the CD is intended to be used in a hifi audio CD player this is the recommended mode. Some older CD-ROMs may have problems reading a blue book CD since it is a multisession CD.
Data in first track
K3b will write the data track before all audio tracks.
Data in last track
K3b will write the data track after all audio tracks.
Caution: The last two modes should only be used for CDs that are unlikely to be played on a hifi audio CD player. It could lead to problems with some older hifi audio CD players that try to play the data track.
External program normalize is not installed. K3b uses normalize (http: / /normalize. nongnu. org/) to normalize audio tracks. In order to use this functionality, please install it first.
K3b is not able to normalize audio tracks when burning on-the-fly. The external program used for this task only supports normalizing a set of audio files.

If this option is checked K3b will hide the first track. The audio CD standard uses pregaps before every track on the CD. By default these last for 2 seconds and are silent. In DAO mode it is possible to have longer pregaps that contain some audio. In this case the first pregap will contain the complete first track. You will need to seek back from the beginning of the CD to listen to the first track. Try it, it is quite amusing. This feature is only available in DAO mode when writing with cdrdao.

Why does K3b offer 4.4 GB and 8.0 GB instead of 4.7 and 8.5 like it says on the media? A single layer DVD media has a capacity of approximately 4.4 GB which equals 4.4*10243 bytes. Media producers just calculate with 1000 instead of 1024 for advertising reasons. This results in 4.4*10243/ 10003 = 4.7 GB.

... that you do not need to erase a CDRW before rewriting it manually since K3b can do that automatically before writing.
... that you do not need to bother with any settings if you do not know what they mean. K3b is able to choose the settings best suited for you.
... that K3b has two types of settings. On the one hand K3b has settings like most KDE applications have accessible through the configuration dialog via the settings menu; on the other hand every K3b action dialog has three buttons to load and save defaults for that action. This way one may, for example, set the defaults for CD Copy: these defaults will then be loaded every time the CD Copy dialog is opened. The button K3b defaults will restore the factory settings in case you do not know if the settings you chose are appropriate.
... that you do not need to bother changing the settings marked as advanced if you do not know what they mean. K3b's defaults are suitable for most daily use.
Just left-click one of your devices in the device and file tree and see what happens. K3b opens a specific window based on the media's contents. For an audio CD for example you will be given a list of the tracks with the possibility to rip these tracks to any format supported by K3b (like mp3 or Ogg-Vorbis).
... that K3b lets you choose media instead of devices for burning. So if you want to burn to a certain medium simply insert it and wait for K3b to detect it. It will then appear as your burning medium.

Controls the quality of the encoded files.
Vorbis' audio quality is not best measured in kilobits per second, but on a scale from -1 to 10 called quality. For now, quality -1 is roughly equivalent to 45kbps average, 5 is roughly 160kbps, and 10 gives about 400kbps. Most people seeking very-near-CD-quality audio encode at a quality of 5 or, for lossless stereo coupling, 6. The quality 3 gives, at approximately 110kbps a smaller filesize and significantly better fidelity than. mp3 compression at 128kbps. This explanation is based on the one from the www. vorbis. com FAQ.
