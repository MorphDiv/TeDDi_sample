Smooth Line Properties
In a chart that displays lines (Line type or X-Y type), you can choose to show curves instead of straight lines.
Some options control the properties of those curves.
To change line properties
Select Cubic Spline or B-Spline.
These are mathematical models that influence the display of the curves.
The cubic spline line passes through all points, while the B-spline line connects the first and last point and passes by the intermediate points.
Optionally set the resolution.
A higher value leads to a smoother line.
For B-spline lines optionally set the data points order.
