Annotating your images
In you can see an example of the window that will greet you once you have started & kphotoalbum; with your own images.
At the top of the screen you will find a menu and toolbar, as you know from any KDE application. Below the toolbar you see the browser window. Currently this is not containing much information, as you have not yet specified any information about your images. In we will get back to the browser, but for now, simply press the View Images item, which will show you an overview of all your images.
Starting & kphotoalbum; with your own images
The key feature of & kphotoalbum; is that you can annotate your images. This includes who is on a given image, where is it taken, etc. You can do this either an image at a time, or you can annotate a number of images simultaneously (For example, all these images contain the person Jesper, and is taken in Copenhagen.)
To annotate an images, select the images in question, and go to Edit Annotate Individual Items. Now you annotate your selected images one after the other. If you instead choose Annotate Multiple Items at a Time, you will annotate all the selected items as if it was one single item. In other words, with this option you mass-annotate your image - e. g. saying all these images was shot in Copenhagen. These two options are also available from a context menu, that you get by right clicking the mouse in the thumbnail overview. An example of this can be seen in.
Context menu for editing properties
In below you can see the window for annotating images and videos. In this window you can specify the date of the item, the label of the item The label is initialized to the name of the file. The label is used in the browser, and when the images are exported to HTML pages, a description for the item, and most important different categories for the item. In the screen shot, these categories are People, Places, and Keywords, but as you will see in, these three predefined categories may be changed to your preferences.
Annotating images and videos
All these annotations may be used for searching and browsing, as we will see in. On request you may see these annotations when viewing the items in the build-in viewer.
Categories
In there are three list boxes combined with a line edits for specifying people, places and keywords. These widget are a very important part of & kphotoalbum;, as you will use them over and over again, when specifying information about your images.
You can specify a property from a list box, simply by selecting it. Select say Donna to specify that Donna is on the given image. Alternatively you may type its name in the line edit. When you start typing a name in the line edit, & kphotoalbum; will look into the listbox, and search for the first item matching what you've typed so far, and fill it out. Thus typing Do might be enough to find Donna. Once you have found the item you search for, simply press & Enter; to select this item in the listbox. The item will now be moved to the top of the view, so next time you need the given item it is even easier to find.
The idea behind moving items to the top when they have been selected is, that when going to, say a family party, you will get perhaps 50 images all with the same 5-10 people. When typing in information about these 50 images you will have the 5-10 people at the top of the listbox as soon as you have typed in their name the first time.
If you prefer to have the list alphabetically sorted instead, simply press the icon for sorting under the list box.
Annotating one item at a time
When you specify properties for one image at a time, you may still of course select a number of images, and say, I want to annotate these images. In this situation, you will find a next and previous button under the image in the topmost rightmost corner.
Annotating multiple items at a time
If you have several images with, say the same person, then it might be more convenient to select those images, and specify that this person is on all images using the Annotate Multiple Items at a Time.
Sub-categories
Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and California are all located in USA. Furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.
Instead of specifying for each and every image from San Francisco, that it is in San Francisco, and in California, and in USA, you may instead tell & kphotoalbum; that San Francisco, and Los Angeles are in California, and that California among others are in USA. Doing so the browser (see) will offer you an item for USA, and an item for California in addition to all your normal items. Selecting California, you will see all images from San Francisco, Los Angeles, etc.
In you can see a browser window, containing USA as a super category. To indicate to you that this is a group, a special icon is used.
Browser showing USA as a super category
In the context menu for the annotation dialog it is possible to add an item to an existing or new super or sub category. In addition you may simply drag an item to a category to make it a sub category of that item. Notice this requires that you are currently sorting your categories alphabetically. See.
Categories shown in alphabetical view of the annotation dialog
Changing layout of the annotation dialog
It is possible to move the items of the annotation dialog around, simply from the bar at the top of the frames, and move them around - you can even make a frame into a top level window on its own.
Once you have found a layout that matches your screen layout, your usage of & kphotoalbum;, etc, simply press the Options... button, that will display a popup menu from which you can save the current window layout.
You may also choose to hide away a frame. If you later want to include that frame in your layout, then choose the Options... button, and from there the Show/ Hide windows item. This can be see in.
