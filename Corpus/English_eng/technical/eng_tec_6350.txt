Introduction
The & kde; & systemsettings; provides the user with a centralized and convenient way to configure all of the & kde; settings.
& systemsettings; is made up of multiple modules. Each module is a separate application, however the & kde; & systemsettings; organizes all of these applications into a single location.
Each & systemsettings; module can be executed individually
See section entitled Running individual & systemsettings; modules for more information.
& systemsettings; groups all of the configuration modules into two basic categories:
General
Advanced
The modules that make up & systemsettings; fall under one of the above categories, making it easier to locate the correct configuration module.
Using & systemsettings;
This section details the use of & systemsettings; itself. For information on each individual module, please see systemsettings; Modules.
Starting & systemsettings;
The & kde; & systemsettings; can be started in one of three ways:
By selecting K Button Applications System Settings.
By pressing Alt; F2. This will bring up the KRunner dialog. Type system settings, and click Launch.
Type systemsettings & at any command prompt.
All three of these methods are equivalent, and produce the same result.
The & kde; & systemsettings; Screen
When you start & systemsettings;, you are presented with a window, which is divided into three functional parts.
Across the top is a toolbar. The toolbar provides the user with the ability to go back into the main view from within a module, or to search for something within all of the modules. You can also find a Help menu as well as a Configure icon which provides you a dialog with alternate view settings.
Underneath the toolbar are two tabs, General and Advanced.
Underneath the tabs is an icon view of the individual modules that make up & systemsettings;. By default, if your mouse stays a few seconds over an icon, a detailed tooltip appears, explaining the purpose of the module.
& systemsettings; General Tab
The General tab consists of modules that allow you to make changes to typical & kde; settings. This section is divided into the following subsections:
Look & Feel
This section covers the settings related to configuring the way you want your & kde; system to look and feel. Settings include the appearance, desktop, notification, and window behavior customizations.
Personal
This section covers the settings related to the user. Settings include personal information about the user, accessibility, default applications, as well as regional and language settings.
Network & Connectivity
This section covers the settings related to network and sharing configuration.
Computer Administration
This section covers the settings related to typical system administration. Settings include data and time, display, fonts, game controllers, keyboard and mouse, as well as system sound.
& systemsettings; Advanced Tab
The Advanced tab consists of modules that allow you to make changes to more advanced & kde; settings. This section is divided into the following subsections:
Advanced User Settings
This section covers the settings related to the more advanced system settings for the user. Settings include digital cameras, file associations, input actions, resources, services, sessions, and hardware management.
System
This sections covers the settings related to specific system settings such as configuration of the login manager.
Exiting the & kde; & systemsettings;
& systemsettings; can be exited in one of two ways:
Press Ctrl; Q on the keyboard.
Click on the Close button located in the top right hand corner of the window.
Configuring & systemsettings;
The Configure icon in the toolbar allows you to change some & systemsettings; parameters. You can change from Icon View (default view) to Classic Tree View.
You can also turn off the detailed tooltips by unchecking Show detailed tooltips. You will then get only normal tooltips.
Running Individual & systemsettings; Modules
Individual modules can be run without running & systemsettings; using the command kcmshell4 from the command line. Type kcmshell4 --list to see a list of the available & kde; & systemsettings; modules.
The & kde; & systemsettings; Modules
In order to make it as easy as possible, the & kde; & systemsettings; has organized options into General and Advanced categories. In the main window, under each category, there are icons grouped together under subcategories. Each icon is called a module. When you click on a module icon, you will be presented with the options of the module in the main window.
Each module will have some or all of the following buttons:
Help
This button will provide help specific to the current module. Clicking the button will open & khelpcenter; in a new window providing detailed information on the module.
Defaults
Clicking this button will restore this module to its default values. You must click Apply to save the options.
Reset
This button will & quot; Resetquot; the module to the previous settings.
Apply
Clicking this button will save all changes to & kde;. If you have changed anything, clicking Apply will cause the changes to take effect.
You must either & quot; Resetquot; or & quot; Applyquot; the any changes before changing to another module.
If you try to change without saving or resetting your options, you will be asked if you want to save your changes, or discard them.
