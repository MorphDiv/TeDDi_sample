EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
XERISTAR
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Xeristar?
Xeristar is a medicine containing the active substance duloxetine.
It is available as gastroresistant capsules (white and blue:
30 mg; green and blue:
60 mg). ‘ Gastroresistant ’ means that the capsules ’ contents pass through the stomach without being broken down until they reach the intestine.
This prevents the active substance being destroyed by the acid in the stomach.
What is Xeristar used for?
Xeristar is used to treat adults with the following diseases: • episodes of major depression; • pain due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy (damage to the nerves in the extremities that can occur in patients with diabetes); • generalised anxiety disorder (long-term anxiety or nervousness about everyday matters).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Xeristar used?
For major depression, the recommended dose of Xeristar is 60 mg once a day.
A response is usually seen in two to four weeks.
It is recommended that treatment continue for several months, to prevent the disease coming back.
For diabetic neuropathic pain, the recommended dose is 60 mg per day but some patients may need a higher dose of 120 mg per day.
The response to treatment should be assessed two months after starting treatment.
If the treatment is effective, it should then be evaluated at least every three months.
For generalised anxiety disorder, the recommended starting dose is 30 mg once a day, but the dose can be increased to 60, 90 or 120 mg depending on the patient’ s response.
Most patients will need to take 60 mg per day.
Patients who also have episodes of major depression should start with 60 mg once a day.
It is recommended that treatment continue for several months, to prevent the disorder coming back.
Xeristar is taken with or without food.
It should be used with caution in elderly patients, particularly at higher doses.
Xeristar should not be used in patients who have certain problems with their liver.
The dose should be reduced gradually when stopping treatment.

How does Xeristar work?
The active substance in Xeristar, duloxetine, is a serotonin-noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor.
It works by preventing the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin) and noradrenaline from being taken back up into nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
Neurotransmitters are chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with one another.
By blocking their re-uptake, duloxetine increases the amount of these neurotransmitters in the spaces between these nerve cells, increasing the level of communication between the cells.
Since these neurotransmitters are involved in maintaining high mood and reducing the sensation of pain, blocking their re-uptake into nerve cells can improve the symptoms of depression, anxiety and neuropathic pain.
How has Xeristar been studied?
For major depression, Xeristar has been studied in seven main studies involving 2,256 patients.
Six of the studies looked at the effectiveness Xeristar in treating depression, and one looked at its effects in preventing it coming back (relapsing).
In the treatment studies, the effectiveness of Xeristar was compared with that of placebo (a dummy treatment) for up to six months.
Some studies also compared the effectiveness of Xeristar with that of paroxetine (another antidepressant).
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms of depression, as measured on a standard scale.
The relapse study compared the effectiveness of Xeristar and placebo over six months in patients who had initially responded to Xeristar, looking at how long it took until symptoms returned.
For the treatment of neuropathic pain, Xeristar has been studied in two 12-week studies in 809 diabetic adults who had had pain every day for at least six months, but did not have major depression.
The effectiveness of three different doses of Xeristar was compared with that of placebo.
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the severity of pain each week, as recorded by the patients on an 11-point scale in daily diaries.
The effectiveness of Xeristar in treating generalised anxiety disorder was compared with that of placebo in four studies involving a total of 1,908 patients.
The main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in symptoms after nine to 10 weeks, as measured on a standard scale for anxiety.
Some studies also compared the effectiveness of Xeristar with that of venlafaxine (another treatment for generalised anxiety disorder).
A fifth study compared the effectiveness of Xeristar and placebo in preventing relapse in 429 patients who had initially responded to Xeristar, looking at how long it took until symptoms returned.
What benefit has Xeristar shown during the studies?
Four of the six studies looking at the treatment of major depression showed that Xeristar was more effective than placebo at reducing symptoms, and two did not.
Although there were inconsistencies across studies in the results obtained with the different doses, in the two studies where Xeristar taken at a dose of 60 mg once a day was compared with placebo, symptom scores had fallen by around 9 points in the patients taking Xeristar after eight weeks, from a starting point of around 21 points.
This compared with a fall of around 6.5 points in those taking placebo.
Xeristar had a similar effect on symptom scores to paroxetine.
In the relapse study, it took longer for symptoms to return in patients taking Xeristar at 60 mg once a day: these patients had a 17% chance of symptoms returning, compared with 29% in the patients taking placebo.
For the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, Xeristar at doses of 60 mg once or twice a day was more effective at reducing pain than placebo.
In both studies, pain reduction was seen from the first week of treatment for up to 12 weeks, with patients taking Xeristar having pain scores between 1.17 and 1.45 points lower than those taking placebo.
For generalised anxiety disorder, Xeristar was more effective than placebo at treating the disorder and preventing relapse.
In the treatment studies, anxiety scores were around 26 points at the start of the studies, falling by around 13 patients in the patients taking Xeristar and by around 9 points in the patients taking placebo.
Xeristar had a similar effect on anxiety scores to venlafaxine.
It also took longer for symptoms to return in patients taking Xeristar: after six months, 14% of the patients taking Xeristar had relapsed, compared with 42% of the patients taking placebo.
2/ 3 What is the risk associated with Xeristar?
The most common side effects with Xeristar (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are nausea (feeling sick), headache, dry mouth, somnolence (sleepiness), fatigue (tiredness), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), dizziness and constipation.
Most of these were mild or moderate, starting early in treatment and getting milder as treatment continued.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Xeristar, see the Package Leaflet.
Xeristar should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients.
Xeristar should not be used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (another group of antidepressants), fluvoxamine (another antidepressant), or ciprofloxacin or enoxacin (types of antibiotic).
Xeristar should also not be used in patients with certain types of liver disease or patients with severe kidney disease.
Treatment should not be started in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), because of a risk of hypertensive crisis (sudden, dangerously high blood pressure).
As with other antidepressants, isolated cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviour have been seen in patients taking Xeristar, particularly in the first few weeks of treatment for depression.
Any patients taking Xeristar who have distressing thoughts or experiences at any time should tell their doctor immediately.
Why has Xeristar been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Xeristar’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of major depressive episodes, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults and generalised anxiety disorder.
The Committee recommended that Xeristar be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Xeristar:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Xeristar to Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH on 17 December 2004.
