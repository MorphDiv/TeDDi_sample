Unmount Tape
KDat will dump your files properly to tape, but may not be able to restore them. To restore your files by hand, you need to know the name of the *non-rewinding* version of your tape device %1.
For example, if your device is / dev/ st0, the non-rewinding version is / dev/ nst0. If your device name does not look like that, type "ls -l %1" in a terminal window to see the real name of your tape drive. Substitute that name for / dev/ nst0 below. Open a terminal window and type the following: tar tfv / dev/ nst0; tar tfv / dev/ nst0 tar xfv / dev/ nst0 The third call to "tar" will retrieve your data into your current directory. Please let us know if this happens to you. - KDat Maintenance Team

KDat:
Click "CANCEL" to stop the backup process. For example, you may quickly see that the size of the files you selected will exceed the size of the backup tape, and may then decide to stop and remove some files from your list of files to backup. Click "Continue" to remove this message while continuing the backup.

Options
Options Widget
This setting determines the capacity that KDat assumes your backup tapes to be. This is used when formatting the tapes.
Tape drives read and write data in individual blocks. This setting controls the size of each block, and should be set to your tape drive's block size. For floppy tape drives this should be set to 10240 bytes.
MB
GB
This option chooses whether the default tape size to the left is in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB).
bytes
Tape block size:
Default tape size:
...
Browse for the tar command.
The location in the filesystem of the non-rewinding tape device. The default is / dev/ tape.
Tar command:
Browse for the tape device.
This setting controls the command that KDat uses to perform the tape backup. The full path should be given. The default is tar.
Tape device:
Tape Drive Options
Load tape on mount
Issue an mtload command prior to mounting the tape.
This command issues an mtload command to the tape device before trying to mount it. This is required by some tape drives.
Lock tape drive on mount
Disable the eject button after mounting the tape.
This option makes KDat try to disable the eject button on the tape drive after the tape has been mounted. This does n't work for all tape drives.
Eject tape on unmount
Try to eject the tape after it is unmounted. Do not use this for ftape.
Try to eject the tape after it has been unmounted. This option should not be used for floppy-tape drives.
Variable block size
Enable variable-block size support in the tape drive.
Some tape drives support different sizes of the data block. With this option, KDat will attempt to enable that support. You must still specify the block size.
