Systemsettings
hardware
backend
This & systemsettings; module allows you to select the backends used by Solid to retrieve information about your hardware, and manage its network connection, bluetooth and infrared devices if present. None of these backends can be used directly by the user.
Power Management Backend
This is used to gather information such as hardware present in your system (such as the connection of storage devices) as well as change settings such as screen brightness, and is used to handle shutting down and suspending the system.
Network Management Backend
This is used by & kde; applications to determine the status of your computers connection to the Internet and other networks. It also allows them to retrieve information such as the current configuration of your network cards, and to change their configuration if permitted.
Bluetooth Management Backend
This is used to communicate with other bluetooth devices, and allows them to be discovered. It can also be used to change the configuration of the systems bluetooth status.
Remote Control Management Backend
Used by & kde; applications to handle input from devices such as infrared remote controls.
