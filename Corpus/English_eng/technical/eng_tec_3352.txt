(PHP 3, PHP 4)
imageloadfont() loads a user-defined bitmap font and returns an identifier for the font (that is always greater than 5, so it will not conflict with the built-in fonts).
The font file format is currently binary and architecture dependent.
This means you should generate the font files on the same type of CPU as the machine you are running PHP on.
Table 1.
Font file format
byte position
C data type
