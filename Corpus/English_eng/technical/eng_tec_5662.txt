Introduction
& knetwalk; is a single player logic game.
The object of the game is to start the LAN, connecting all the terminals to the server, in as few turns as possible.
How to Play
The player is presented with a rectangular grid containing a server, several terminals, and pieces of wire. The object of the game is to rotate these elements until every client is connected to the server, and no wires are left unconnected. Optionally, you can try to get a high score by minimizing the number of rotations needed.
Left clicking on a square rotates it counterclockwise, while right clicking rotates it clockwise. Middle clicking on a square marks it as blocked and prevents it from being rotated unless it gets unblocked by another middle click; this can be very useful for marking squares which are known to be in the correct orientation. The status bar displays the number of clicks so far.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Rules
There is only one possible correct solution for every game.
When playing the Very hard difficulty level connections can wrap from left to right and from top to bottom.
The game ends when every terminal and every wire is connected to the server.
The score represents the number of clicks it took to complete the game. The lower the score the better.
Strategies and Tips
Start seeking for squares which orientation can be easily determined.
Once you are sure of the orientation of a square you can mark it using the & MMB;. This is particularly usefull in harder games.
Look for I-shaped and T-shaped wires near the borders, and L-shaped wires near the edges. The position of these squares can be easily determined, unless you are playing the Very hard difficulty level.
When playing the Very hard difficulty level a good place to start looking is near empty squares, if present, and near regions containing many terminals grouped together.
Even when playing with the same difficulty level some games are easier than others, restart the game if you want to get a different board.
If you want to get a good score, only do a move when you are sure.
