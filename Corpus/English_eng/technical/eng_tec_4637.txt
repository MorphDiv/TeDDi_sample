This function returns a single string from the user.
You may specify a string with which to prompt the user.
The line returned has the ending newline removed.
You must add this line to the history yourself using readline_add_history().
Example 1. readline()
/ / get 3 commands from user for ($i=0; $i 3; $i++) {$line = readline ("Command: "); readline_add_history ($line);} / /dump history print_r (readline_list_history()); / /dump variables print_r (readline_info());
