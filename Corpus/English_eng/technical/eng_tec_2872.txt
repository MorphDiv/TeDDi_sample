Returns:
TRUE on success, FALSE on error.
fbsql_set_lob_mode() sets the mode for retrieving LOB data from the database.
When BLOB and CLOB data is stored in FrontBase it can be stored direct or indirect.
Direct stored LOB data will always be fetched no matter the setting of the lob mode.
If the LOB data is less than 512 bytes it will always be stored directly.
FBSQL_LOB_DIRECT - LOB data is retrieved directly.
When data is fetched from the database with fbsql_fetch_row(), and other fetch functions, all CLOB and BLOB columns will be returned as ordinary columns.
This is the default value on a new FrontBase result.
FBSQL_LOB_HANDLE - LOB data is retrieved as handles to the data.
When data is fetched from the database with fbsql_fetch_row (), and other fetch functions, LOB data will be returned as a handle to the data if the data is stored indirect or the data if it is stored direct.
If a handle is returned it will be a 27 byte string formatted as "@'000000000000000000000000'".
