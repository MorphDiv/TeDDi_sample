You can enter a fractional number in a cell and use it for calculation:

In the input line above the spreadsheet you will see the value 0.2, which is used for the calculation.

Select &quot; Fraction &quot; from the
Category
field, and then select &quot; -1234 10/81 &quot; .
You can then enter fractions such as 12/31 or 12/32 - the fractions are, however, automatically reduced, so that in the last example you would see 3/8.
