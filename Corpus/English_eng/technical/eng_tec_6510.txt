New Session
You have chosen to open another desktop session. The current session will be hidden and a new login screen will be displayed. An F-key is assigned to each session; F%1 is usually assigned to the first session, F%2 to the second session and so on. You can switch between sessions by pressing Ctrl, Alt and the appropriate F-key at the same time. Additionally, the KDE Panel and Desktop menus have actions for switching between sessions.
