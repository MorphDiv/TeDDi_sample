Control Structures

continue is used within looping structures to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and continue execution at the beginning of the next iteration.
continue accepts an optional numeric argument which tells it how many levels of enclosing loops it should skip to the end of.
while (list ($key, $value) = each ($arr)) {if (!($key% 2)) {/ / skip odd members continue;} do_something_odd ($value);} $i = 0; while ($i+ + 5) {echo "Outer br \n"; while (1) {echo "nbsp; nbsp;Middle br \n"; while (1) {echo" nbsp; nbsp;Inner br \n"; continue 3;} echo "This never gets output. br \n";} echo "Neither does this. br \n";}
