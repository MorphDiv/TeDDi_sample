Configuring & konqueror;
In common with the rest of & kde;, & konqueror; is highly configurable, so you can really get the look and feel that best fits your needs and wishes.
Toolbars
When & kde; is newly installed, & konqueror; 's window contains a Menubar, Main and Location Toolbars and possibly a Bookmark Toolbar.
Maybe you do n't need all these toolbars. To hide one of them, go into the Settings Toolbars menu and uncheck its box. To show a hidden toolbar, just check the box.
The Menubar itself can be toggled on and off with the shortcut key combination Ctrl; M.
On the left hand end of each bar you can see some vertical lines. By & LMB; clicking on them, you flatten the bar, meaning that it is hidden but can be quickly restored by clicking on the now horizontal lines. You can also drag a bar into a new position with these lines.
If you right click on a Toolbar, you will get a menu to configure this bar. You can choose the orientation, text position and icon size
The icons shown in the various bars can be changed by using the Settings Configure Toolbars... option, which brings up the Configure Toolbars dialog box. The Main and Extra Toolbars are divided into sections, such as Main Toolbar & lt; konqueror; gt;, Main Toolbar & lt; khtmlpartgt; and Extra Toolbar & lt; khtmlsettingsplugingt;. The number and type of these sections will depend on whether & konqueror; is in Web Browser or File Manager mode and whether you have & konqueror; plugins installed.
Shortcuts
To change the shortcut key arrangements used by & konqueror; select Settings Configure Shortcuts.... This will launch a dialog box as shown below.

Search through the combo box to find the action you want to add or change the shortcut keys for and select it by left clicking on the name. You will then be able to change the shortcut by selecting the None, Default or Custom radio button or by clicking on the large button in the Shortcut for Selected Action area.
If you select Define Shortcut, and then select Advanced, the dialog box below will be shown:

Choose whether you want to change the Primary or Alternate shortcut then press the key combination you want to act as the shortcut, for example & Ctrl; Shift; S. If the Auto-Close box is checked the dialog will vanish as soon as you enter the key combination, otherwise it will remain until you press OK or Cancel. Clicking on the little black icon with a white cross in it clears the shortcut.
User Defined Menus
You can add your own pop up menu to & konqueror; so that pressing one key combination will make the menu appear then pressing a second key, or using the Up arrow and Down arrow keys and pressing Enter, will select an item from it.
To do this add a Custom shortcut for each of the actions you want to appear in the menu and in the Define Shortcut dialog check the Multi-Key box, press the key combination that you want to bring up your new menu then, separately, press the key that will choose that item from the menu.
Other Settings
Selecting Settings Configure Konqueror... brings up a dialog box which you can use to control most aspects of & konqueror; 's behavior. It contains several sections which are selected by left clicking on one of the icons at the left of the dialog box.
Pressing the Help button will give you detailed instructions about how to use each of these sections, or you can use the What's This? feature.
