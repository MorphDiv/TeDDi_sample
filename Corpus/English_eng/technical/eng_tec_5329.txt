PHP Manual

These functions allow you to access records stored in dBase-format (dbf) databases.
There is no support for indexes or memo fields.
There is no support for locking, too.
Two concurrent webserver processes modifying the same dBase file will very likely ruin your database.
dBase files are simple sequential files of fixed length records.
Records are appended to the end of the file and delete records are kept until you call dbase_pack().
We recommend that you do not use dBase files as your production database.
Choose any real SQL server instead; MySQL or Postgres are common choices with PHP. dBase support is here to allow you to import and export data to and from your web database, because the file format is commonly understood by Windows spreadsheets and organizers.
In order to enable the bundled dbase library and to use these functions, you must compile PHP with the --enable-dbase option.
This extension has no configuration directives defined in php.ini.
This extension has no resource types defined.
This extension has no constants defined.
