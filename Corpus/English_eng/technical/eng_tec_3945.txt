(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
mysql_drop_db() attempts to drop (remove) an entire database from the server associated with the specified link identifier.
For downward compatibility mysql_dropdb() can also be used.
This is deprecated, however.
Note:
The function mysql_drop_db() is deprecated.
It is preferable to use mysql_query() to issue a SQL DROP DATABASE statement instead.
See also: mysql_create_db(), mysql_query().
