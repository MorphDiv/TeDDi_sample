The alt tab behaviour.
Sets the Alt-Tab behaviour. Possible values are: all_thumbnails and workspace_icons. See the configuration dialogs for details.
All & Thumbnails
This mode presents all applications from all workspaces in one selection list. Instead of using the application icon of every window, it uses small thumbnails resembling the window itself.
Workspace & Icons
This mode let's you switch between the applications of your current workspace and gives you additionally the option to switch to the last used application of your previous workspace. This is always the last symbol in the list and is segregated by a separator/vertical line if available. 
Every window is represented by its application icon.
Move current selection to front before closing the popup
The Alternate Tab can be used in different modes, that affect the way windows are chosen and presented.

Hello, world!
Alternative greeting text.

Example aims to show how to build well behaved extensions for the Shell and as such it has little functionality on its own.
Nevertheless it's possible to customize the greeting message.

Use more screen for windows
Try to use more screen for placing window thumbnails by adapting to screen aspect ratio, and consolidating them further to reduce the bounding box. This setting applies only with the natural placement strategy.
Place window captions on top
If true, place window captions on top the respective thumbnail, overriding shell default of placing it at the bottom. Changing this setting requires restarting the shell to have any effect.
