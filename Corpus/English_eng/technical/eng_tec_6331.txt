Error
Import Color Scheme
The scheme you have selected appears to be a KDE3 scheme. KDE will attempt to import this scheme, however many color roles have been added since KDE3. Some manual work will likely be required. This scheme will not be saved automatically.
Notice
Save Color Scheme
& Enter a name for the color scheme:
A color scheme with that name already exists. Do you want to overwrite it?
You do not have permission to overwrite that scheme

Colors This module allows you to choose the color scheme used for the KDE desktop. The different elements of the desktop, such as title bars, menu text, etc., are called "widgets". You can choose the widget whose color you want to change by selecting it from a list, or by clicking on a graphical representation of the desktop. You can save color settings as complete color schemes, which can also be modified or deleted. KDE comes with several predefined color schemes on which you can base your own. All KDE applications will obey the selected color scheme. Non-KDE applications may also obey some or all of the color settings, if this option is enabled.
This is a preview of the color settings which will be applied if you click "Apply" or "OK". You can click on different parts of this preview image. The widget name in the "Widget color" box will change to reflect the part of the preview image you clicked.
This is a list of predefined color schemes, including any that you may have created. You can preview an existing color scheme by selecting it from the list. The current scheme will be replaced by the selected color scheme. Warning: if you have not yet applied any changes you may have made to the current scheme, those changes will be lost if you select another color scheme.
Press this button if you want to save the current color settings as a color scheme. You will be prompted for a name.
Press this button to remove the selected color scheme. Note that this button is disabled if you do not have permission to delete the color scheme.
Press this button to import a new color scheme. Note that the color scheme will only be available for the current user.
