... that you can get a'Linux console-like 'terminal? Hide Konsole's menubar, tabbar and scrollbar, select the Linux font and the Linux Colors schema and apply the full-screen mode. You might also want to set the KDE panel to auto-hide.
... that you can rename your Konsole sessions by clicking with the right mouse button and selecting "Rename session"? The change will be reflected in the Konsole tabbar, making it easier to remember the content of the session.
... that you can rename a Konsole session by double-clicking its tab?

... that you can let Konsole set the current directory as the session name? For Bash, put'export PS1=$PS1"\\[\\e]30; \\H: \\w\\a\\] "'in your ~/. bashrc.
... that if you let your shell pass the current directory to Konsole within the prompt variable, e. g. for Bash with'export PS1=$PS1"\\[\\e]31; \\w\\a\\] "'in your ~/. bashrc, then Konsole can bookmark it, and session management will remember your current working directory on non-Linux systems too?

Konsole is unable to open a PTY (pseudo teletype). It is likely that this is due to an incorrect configuration of the PTY devices. Konsole needs to have read/ write access to the PTY devices.

You have chosen one or more Ctrl+< key > combinations to be used as shortcuts. As a result these key combinations will no longer be passed to the command shell or to applications that run inside Konsole. This can have the unintended consequence that functionality that would otherwise be bound to these key combinations is no longer accessible. You may wish to reconsider your choice of keys and use Alt+ Ctrl+< key > or Ctrl+Shift+ < key > instead. You are currently using the following Ctrl+ < key > combinations:
