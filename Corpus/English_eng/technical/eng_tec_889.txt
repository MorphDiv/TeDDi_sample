ODBC

ODBC
ODBC
databases.
This includes your user access data, driver settings, and font definitions.
User Name
Type the user name for accessing the database.
Password required
Prevents an unauthorised user from accessing the database.
You only need to enter the password once per session.
Driver Settings
Use this text field to enter additional optional driver settings if this is necessary.
Character Set
Select the code conversion that you want to use to view the database in $[officename].
This does not affect the database.
Choose &quot; System &quot; to use the default character set of your operating system.
Text and dBASE databases are restricted to character sets with a fixed-size character length, where all characters are encoded with the same number of bytes.
General
Retrieve generated values
Enables $[officename] support of auto-incremented data fields for the current ODBC or JDBC data source.
Mark this check box if the database does not support the auto-increment feature in its SDBCX layer.
In general, the auto-increment is selected for the primary key field.
Auto-increment statement
Enter the SQL command specifier that instructs the data source to auto-increment a specified Integer data field.
For example, a typical SQL statement to create a data field is:
CREATE TABLE &quot; table1 &quot; ( &quot; id &quot; INTEGER)
To auto-increment the &quot; id &quot; data field in a MySQL database, change the statement to:
CREATE TABLE &quot; table1 &quot; ( &quot; id &quot; INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT)
Auto-increment statement
box.
Query of generated values
Enter an SQL statement that returns the last auto-incremented value for the primary key data field.
For example:
SELECT LAST_INSERT_D();
Use SQL-92 naming constraints
Only allows names that use characters that conform to the SQL-92 naming constraints in the data source.
All other characters are rejected.
Each name must begin with a lower or upper case letter, or an underline ( _ ).
The remaining characters can be ASCII letters, underlines, and numbers.
Use Catalogue for file-based databases
Uses the current data source of the Catalogue.
This is useful when the ODBC data source is a database server.
If the ODBC data source is a dBASE driver, leave this check box clear.
