Technologies
IO Slave
IO Slaves enable & kde; applications to access remote resources as easily as local resources (making them network transparent). Remote resources (eg; files) might be stored on SMB shares or similar.
SMB kde;
KIO
The & kde; Input/ Output system which makes use of so-called IO Slaves.
IO Slave kde;
KParts
KParts is an embedding technology which allows & kde; applications to embed other & kde; applications. For example, the text view used by & konqueror; is a KPart.
konqueror;
KSycoca
KSycoca (kde; Sy stem Co nfiguration Ca che) is a configuration cache which, for example, guarantees fast access to the menu entries.
KBuildSycoca
XFree86
Antialiasing
If mentioned in context with & kde;, anti-aliasing often means the smoothing of the fonts visible on the screen. & Qt; version 2.3.0 or higher used together with XFree86 4. x makes this possible under & kde; as well.
kde; Qt;
& X-Server;
The & X-Server; represents a basic layer upon which the various & GUI; s like & kde; are built. It manages the basic mouse and keyboard input (from the local host as well as from remote hosts) and provides elementary graphic routines to draw rectangles and other primitives.
kde; GUI;
Applications
KBuildSycoca4 is a command line program and regenerates the so-called KSycoca. This is useful, for example, if some or all modules in & systemsettings; are missing.
KSycoca systemsettings;
& systemsettings;
This is the project and filename of the & kde; control center. & systemsettings; allows you to customize virtually every configuration option of & kde;.
kde;
konqueror;
& konqueror; is a web browser, picture viewer, file manager and more, and a core part of the & kde; project. You can find more information about & konqueror; at www. konqueror. org.
Desktop Terminology
Drag and Drop
This concept tries to replace many actions like copying files from one place to another by a certain mouse movement, & eg; clicking on an icon in a & konqueror; window, moving the mouse to another window while keeping the mouse button pressed, and releasing the mouse button (dropping the object) copies files.
GUI;
Abbreviation for G raphical U ser I nterface. Every desktop environment (like & kde;) is a & GUI;. Most & GUI; s feature mouse support and/ or windows to manage the programs.
kde;
Abbreviation for K Desktop Environment, a leading & GUI; for & UNIX; -based systems. You can find more detailed information at www. kde. org.
GUI;
GNOME
G NU N etwork O bject M odel E nvironment, one of the leading & UNIX; & GUI; s.
Panel
Refers to the panel which often resides at the bottom of the screen.
ripping
The process of reading audio data from a & cdrom; and storing it on the hard disk.
& kde; Development
& Qt;
The & GUI; of & kde; is built on top of the & Qt; toolkit, which provides many graphical elements (so-called Widgets) which are used to construct the desktop. You can find more information about & Qt; at www. trolltech. com.
kde; GUI; Widget
i18n
Abbreviation for internationalization. & kde; supports many different languages, and several i18n techniques make it easy to translate the & GUI; as well as the accompanying documents of & kde; into all these languages. More information about the i18n process is available at l10n. kde. org.
l10n
Abbreviation for localization, the process of adapting a program to the local environment. This includes & eg; the currency used for monetary values or the time format.
i18n
Widget
Graphical elements like scrollbars, buttons or input fields which are used by & kde; to construct the & GUI;.
SVN
Abbreviation for Subversion, a version control system. The SVN is a very elegant way of managing file versions that allow more than one developer to easily work on the same project. You can find a description of how to get the latest (developer) version of the & kde; sources via anonymous SVN on http: / /developer. kde. org/ source/ anonsvn. html. More about SVN is available at http: / /subversion. tigris. org/.
Miscellaneous
RFC
R equest F or C omment. A common way to publish new protocol ideas or procedures for evaluation of the Internet community. Though RFC s are not mandatory, many applications try to adhere to them, once they have been approved by the community. More information about RFC s can be found at the RFC Homepage.
Various protocols
SMB
S erver M essage B lock. A network protocol used in & Microsoft; & Windows; networks to access the file systems of other computers.
IO Slave
IRC
I nternet R elay C hat. A protocol defined in RFC 1459, which handles the specification to enable real-time text chat.
host
This can either be a name from your / etc/ hosts file (mycomputer), an Internet name (www. kde. org) or an IP-Address (192.168.0.10).
