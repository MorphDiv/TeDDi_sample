Overview
Applying example for the Unsharp Mask filter
Original image
Filter
Out-of-focus photographs and most digitized images often need a sharpness correction. This is due to the digitizing process that must chop a color continuum up in points with slightly different colors: elements thinner than sampling frequency will be averaged into an uniform color. So sharp borders are rendered a little blurred. The same phenomenon appears when printing color dots on paper.
The Unsharp Mask filter (what an odd name!) sharpens edges of the elements without increasing noise or blemish. It is the king of the sharpen filters.
Some imaging devices like digital cameras or scanners offer to sharpen the created images for you. We strongly recommend you disable the sharpening in this devices and use the GIMP filters instead. This way you regain the full control over the sharpening of your images.
To prevent color distortion while sharpening, Decompose your image to HSV and work only on Value. Then Compose the image to HSV. Go to

Preview
Parameter setting results are interactively displayed in preview. Scroll bars allow you to move around the image.
Radius
The slider and input boxes (0.1-120) allow you to set how many pixels on either side of an edge will be affected by sharpening. High resolution images allow higher radius. It is better to always sharpen an image at its final resolution.
Amount
This slider and input boxes (0.00-5.00) allow you to set strength of sharpening.
Threshold
This slider and input boxes (0-255) allow you to set the minimum difference in pixel values that indicates an edge where sharpen must be applied. So you can protect areas of smooth tonal transition from sharpening, and avoid creation of blemishes in face, sky or water surface.
How does an unsharp mask work?
Using an unsharp mask to sharpen an image can seem rather weird. Here is the explanation:
Think of an image with a contrast in some place. The intensity curve of the pixels on a line going through this contrast will show an abrupt increase of intensity: like a stair if contrast is perfectly sharp, like an S if there is some blur.
Now, we have an image with some blur we want to sharpen (black curve). We apply some more blur: the intensity variation will be more gradual (green curve).
Let us subtract the blurredness intensity from the intensity of the image. We get the red curve, which is more abrupt : contrast and sharpness are increased. QED.
Unsharp mask has first been used in silver photography. The photograph first creates a copy of the original negative by contact, on a film, placing a thin glass plate between both; that will produce a blurred copy because of light diffusion. Then he places both films, exactly corresponding, in a photo enlarger, to reproduce them on paper. The dark areas of the positive blurred film, opposed to the clear areas of the original negative will prevent light to go through and so will be subtracted from the light going through the original film.
In digital photography, with GIMP, you will go through the following steps:
Open your image and duplicate it
In the copy, duplicate the layer
In the layer dialog of the duplicated image, change Mode to
Click and drag the only layer you got into the original image, where it appears as a new layer.
Change the Mode in this layer dialog to
Voilà. The
At the beginning of the curve, you can see a dip. If blurring is important, this dip is very deep; the result of the subtraction can be negative, and a complementary color stripe will appear along the contrast, or a black halo around a star on the light background of a nebula (black eye effect).

Sharpen
Most of digitized images need correction of sharpness. This is due to digitizing process that must chop a color continuum up in points with slightly different colors: elements thinner than sampling frequency will be averaged into an uniform color. So sharp borders are rendered a little blurred. The same phenomenon appears when printing color dots on paper.
The Sharpen filter accentuates edges but also any noise or blemish and it may create noise in graduated color areas like the sky or a water surface. It competes with the Unsharp Mask filter, which is more sophisticated and renders more natural results.

Sharpness

Introduction
Enhance filters are used to compensate for image imperfections. Such imperfections include dust particles, noise, interlaced frames (coming usually from a TV frame-grabber) and insufficient sharpness.

Deinterlace
Images captured by videocards, especially when fast movement is recorded, may look blurred and stripped, with split objects. This is due to how cameras work. They don't record 25 images per second, but 50, with half vertical resolution. There are two interlaced images in one frame. First line of first image is followed by first line of second image followed by second line of first image... etc. So, if there have been an important move between the two images, objects will appear split, shifted, stripped.
The Deinterlace filter keeps only one of both images and replaces missing lines by a gradient between previous and following lines. The resulting image, or selection, will be somewhat blurred, but can be improved by enhance filters

Nonlinear filter
Example for the NL-Filter

NL means
This is something of a swiss army knife filter. It has 3 distinct operating modes. In all of the modes each pixel in the image is examined and processed according to it and its surrounding pixels values. Rather than using 9 pixels in a 3x3 block, it uses an hexagonal block whose size can be set with the Radius option.

The filter does not work if the active layer has an alpha channel. Then the menu entry is insensitive and grayed out.

Controls the size of the effective sampling region around each pixel. The range of this value is 0.33-1.00, where 0.33 means just the pixel itself (and thus the filter will have no effect), and 1.00 means all pixels in the 3x3 grid are sampled.
Operating Modes
This filter can perform several distinct functions:
Alpha trimmed mean
The value of the center pixel will be replaced by the mean of the 7 hexagon values, but the 7 values are sorted by size and the top and bottom

Optimal estimation
This type of filter applies a smoothing filter adaptively over the image. For each pixel the variance of the surrounding hexagon values is calculated, and the amount of smoothing is made inversely proportional to it. The idea is that if the variance is small then it is due to noise in the image, while if the variance is large, it is because of
Edge enhancement
This is the opposite type of filter to the smoothing filter. It enhances edges. The
Combination use
The various operating modes can be used one after the other to get the desired result. For instance to turn a monochrome dithered image into grayscale image you could try one or two passes of the smoothing filter, followed by a pass of the optimal estimation filter, then some subtle edge enhancement. Note that using edge enhancement is only likely to be useful after one of the non-linear filters (alpha trimmed mean or optimal estimation filter), as edge enhancement is the direct opposite of smoothing.
For reducing color quantization noise in images (i.e. turning .gif files back into 24 bit files) you could try a pass of the optimal estimation filter (
