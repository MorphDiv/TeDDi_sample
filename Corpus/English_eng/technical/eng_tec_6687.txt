Note of the Day
This add-in automatically creates a "Today" note for jotting daily thoughts down. The current date is used as a basis for the title of the note. As an example, the title of a "Today" note created on February 28, 2007, would be, "Today: Wednesday, February 28 2007".
If you leave a "Today" note unmodified, the Note of the Day Add-in will automatically delete the note.
To customize the content of the default "Today" note, create a new note and change the title of the note to be, "Today: Template". Change the content of the template note to whatever you like. When new "Today" notes are created, it will then use the content of your "Today: Template" note.

Editing Notes Content
Editing Notes
Notes are opened in the same window by replacing search with note content.
At the top of the note there are two toolbars. The above one has items for going back to search mode and for creating new note. The lower one contains several buttons and text. Directly below this toolbar is the content area of the note.



The note can be edited by clicking in the content area and using the keyboard to add and remove content. The first line is considered the title of the note. By default this is populated with the text "New Note N". The title is changed by clicking in the content area on the first line and using the keyboard to change the title. By default, focus is given to the content area upon creation of a new note, so you can immediately start editing the note without the need to click on the content area with the mouse.
