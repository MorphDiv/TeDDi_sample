ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
& FTP; is the Internet service used to transfer a data file from the disk of one computer to the disk of another, regardless of the operating system type.
Similar to other Internet applications, & FTP; uses the client-server approach & mdash; a user invokes an & FTP; program on the computer, instructs it to contact a remote computer, and then requests the transfer of one or more files. The local & FTP; program becomes a client that uses TCP to contact an & FTP; server program on the remote computer. Each time the user requests a file transfer, the client and the server programs cooperate to send a copy of the data across the Internet.
& FTP; servers which allow anonymous & FTP; permit any user, not only users with accounts on the host, to browse the ftp archives and download files. Some & FTP; servers are configured to allow users to upload files.
& FTP; is commonly used to retrieve information and obtain software stored in files at & FTP; archive sites throughout the world.
