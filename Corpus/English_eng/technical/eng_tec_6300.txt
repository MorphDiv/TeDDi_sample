& kde; Resources
This module is a configuration tool for managing the resources used by different & kde; applications. It allows you to add, deleted or modify the resources for Alarms, Calendar, Notes and Contacts.
Select a resource type from the drop down box at the top of the Resources section. The list box now displays names and types of available resources of this type. One of these resources is marked as the standard resource.
Use the buttons on the right side of the listbox to add, remove or edit resources.
Detailed information about resource types and options you find in the links provided in the following table:

Every resource type needs a standard resource, where all data should be saved if no other resource is specified. If you want to change the standard resource, use the Use as Standard button to select it. You must have both read and write access to the new standard resource, otherwise you will not be able to select it.
