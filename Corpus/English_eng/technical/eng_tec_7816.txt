ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Firazyr 30 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each pre-filled syringe of 3 ml contains icatibant acetate equivalent to 30 mg icatibant.
Each ml of the solution contains 10 mg of icatibant.
For a full list of excipients see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Solution for injection.
The solution is a clear and colourless liquid.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Firazyr is indicated for symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults (with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dose of Firazyr is one subcutaneous injection of 30 mg administered by a health care professional, preferably in the abdominal area, for the treatment of a hereditary angioedema attack.
Firazyr is not for self-administration.
Firazyr is intended for subcutaneous use.
For single use only.
Patients with laryngeal attacks need to be carefully managed in an appropriate medical institution after injection until the physician considers discharge to be safe.
Injection should be given slowly due to the large volume to be administered (3 ml).
In the majority of cases a single injection of Firazyr is sufficient to treat an attack.
In case of insufficient relief or recurrence of symptoms, a second injection of Firazyr can be administered after 6 hours.
If the second injection produces insufficient relief or a recurrence of symptoms is observed, a third injection of Firazyr can be administered after a further 6 hours.
No more than 3 injections of Firazyr should be administered in a 24 hour period.
In the clinical trials, not more than 8 injections of Firazyr per month have been administered.
Children and adolescents There is no experience in children.
Elderly patients Limited information is available on patients older than 65 years of age.
Elderly patients have been shown to have increased systemic exposure to icatibant.
The relevance of this to the safety of Firazyr is unknown (see section 5.2).
2 Hepatic impairment No dosage adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment.
Renal impairment No dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Ischemic heart disease Under ischemic conditions, a deterioration of cardiac function and a decrease in coronary blood flow could theoretically arise from antagonism of bradykinin receptor type 2.
Caution should therefore be observed in the administration of Firazyr to patients with acute ischemic heart disease or unstable angina pectoris (see section 5.3).
Stroke Although there is evidence to support a beneficial effect of B2 receptor blockade immediately following a stroke, there is a theoretical possibility that icatibant may attenuate the positive late phase neuroprotective effects of bradykinin.
Accordingly, caution should be observed in the administration of icatibant to patients in the weeks following a stroke.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions involving CYP450 are not expected (see section 5.2)
Co-administration of Firazyr with ACE inhibitors has not been studied.
ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in HAE patients due to possible enhancement of bradykinin levels.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
For icatibant, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Animal studies showed effects on uterine implantation and parturition (see section 5.3), but the potential risk for humans is unknown.
Firazyr should be used during pregnancy only, if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the foetus, (e. g for treatment of potentially life threatening laryngeal attacks).
Icatibant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations similar to those in maternal blood.
No effects were detected in the post-natal development of rat pups.
It is unknown whether icatibant is excreted in human breast milk but it is recommended that breastfeeding women, who wish to take Firazyr, should not breastfeed for 12 hours after treatment.
In immature animals repeated use of icatibant reversibly delayed sexual maturation (see section.
5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Firazyr has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Fatigue, lethargy, tiredeness, somnolence, and dizziness have been reported uncommonly following the use of Firazyr.
These symptoms may occur as a result of an attack of HAE.
However, a causal relationship to the use of Firazyr cannot be excluded.
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel tired or dizzy.
3 4.8 Undesirable effects
The safety of icatibant has been established in 1022 subjects treated with various doses, regimens and routes of administration during Phase I-III studies in various indications.
Sixty three (HAE) patients received icatibant in two Phase III trials for treatment of an attack in the controlled phase and 118 patients were treated in the open label phase.
Almost all subjects who were treated with subcutaneous icatibant in clinical trials developed reactions at the site of injection including erythema, swelling, warm sensation, burning, itching and/ or cutaneous pain.
These reactions were generally mild in severity, transient, and resolved without further intervention.
The frequency of adverse reactions listed in Table 1 is defined using the following convention:
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Note:
Due to the low number of patients, each of the uncommon events has only been reported in a single patient.

* HAE attacks were reported as adverse reactions, however based on time of occurrence, the majority were recurrent attacks and not related to treatment with Firazyr.
4 4.9 Overdose
No clinical information on overdose is available.
A dose of 3.2 mg/ kg intravenously (approximately 8 times the therapeutic dose) caused transient erythema, itching or hypotension in healthy subjects.
No therapeutic intervention was necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
[to be decided] ATC code:
[not yet assigned].
HAE (an autosomal dominant disease) is caused by an absence or dysfunction of C1-esterase- inhibitor.
HAE attacks are accompanied by an increased release of bradykinin, which is the key mediator in the development of the clinical symptoms.
HAE manifests as intermittent attacks of subcutaneous and/ or sub mucosal oedema involving the upper respiratory tract, the skin and the gastrointestinal tract.
An attack usually lasts between 2 to 5 days.
Icatibant is a selective competitive antagonist at the bradykinin type 2 (B2) receptor.
It is a synthetic decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin, but with 5 non-proteinogenic amino acids.
In HAE increased bradykinin concentrations are the key mediator in the development of the clinical symptoms.
In healthy young subjects, icatibant administered in doses of 0.8 mg/ kg over 4 hours; 1.5 mg/ kg/ day or 0.15 mg/ kg/ day for 3 days, development of bradykinin-induced hypotension, vasodilatation and reflex tachycardia was prevented.
Icatibant was shown to be a competitive antagonist when the bradykinin challenge dose was increased 4-fold.
Efficacy data were obtained from an initial open-label Phase II study and from two randomised, double blind controlled multi centre Phase III studies (one with oral tranexamic acid as the comparator and one placebo controlled).
The pivotal Phase III studies were otherwise identical in design.
A total of 130 patients were randomized to receive either a 30 mg dose of icatibant (63 patients) or comparator (either tranexamic acid, - 38 or placebo - 29 patients).
Subsequent episodes of HAE were treated in an open label extension.
Patients with symptoms of laryngeal angioedema received open label treatment with icatibant.
In the Phase III trials, the primary efficacy endpoint was time to onset of symptom relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS).
In both studies, patients on icatibant had a faster median time to onset of symptom relief (2.0 and 2.5 hours, respectively) compared to tranexamic acid (12.0 hours) and placebo (4.6 hours).
The treatment effect of icatibant was confirmed by secondary efficacy endpoints.

6 One hundred and eighteen patients were treated in the open label extension (OLE) phase for a total of 597 separate attacks.
The efficacy results were similar to those seen in the controlled phase of the studies.
The majority of attacks (89.3% and 90.9%, respectively) in both studies required only a single dose of icatibant.
A total of 36 patients were treated for a total of 61 attacks of HAE affecting the larynx.
The results were again similar to patients with non-laryngeal attacks of HAE with a median time to start of regression of symptoms of 0.6 - 1.0 hours (controlled phase).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of icatibant has been extensively characterized by studies using both intravenous and subcutaneous administration to healthy volunteers and patients.
The pharmacokinetic profile of icatibant in patients with HAE is similar to that in healthy volunteers.
Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability of icatibant is 97%.
The time to maximum concentration is approximately 0.5 hours.
Distribution Icatibant volume of distribution (Vss) is about 20-25 L.
Plasma protein binding is 44%.
Elimination Icatibant is mainly eliminated by metabolism with less than 10% of the dose eliminated in the urine as unchanged drug.
Clearance is about 15-20 l/ h and independent of dose.
The terminal half-life is about 1-2 hours.
Metabolism Icatibant is extensively metabolized by proteolytic enzymes to inactive metabolites that are primarily excreted in the urine.
In vitro studies have confirmed that icatibant is not degraded by oxidative metabolic pathways and is not an inhibitor of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) and is not an inducer of CYP 1A2 and 3A4.
Special populations Data suggest an age-related decline in clearance resulting in about 50-60% higher exposure in the elderly (75-80 years) compared to a patient aged 40 years.
Data suggests that gender and weight do not have a significant influence on icatibant pharmacokinetics.
Limited data suggest that icatibant exposure is not influenced by hepatic or renal impairment.
The influence of race on icatibant pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated.
There are no pharmacokinetic data in children.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Repeated-dose studies of up to 3-months duration have been conducted in rat and dog.
Maximum daily exposures (AUC) at the No Observed Adverse Effect Levels in the 3-month study in rat were 3.6 times and in the 4 week study in dog were 9.4 times the AUC in humans after a subcutaneous dose of 30 mg.
Long-term studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of icatibant have not been conducted to date.
In a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests icatibant was not genotoxic.
Icatibant was not teratogenic when administered by s. c. injection during early embryonic and fetal development in rat (top dose 25 mg/ kg/ day) and rabbit (top dose 10 mg/ kg/ day).
Icatibant is a potent
7 antagonist of bradykinin and therefore, at high dose levels, treatment can have effects on the uterine implantation process and subsequent uterine stability in early pregnancy.
These uterine effects also manifest in late stage pregnancy where icatibant exhibits a tocolytic effect resulting in delayed parturition in the rat, with increased fetal distress and perinatal death at high doses (10 mg/ kg/ day).
In immature rats and dogs, repeated use of icatibant reversibly delayed sexual maturation.
The effects appeared to be secondary to icatibant-induced changes in gonadotrophin levels, and were reversible.
Similar effects of icatibant on gonadotrophins also occurred in sexually mature dogs.
Icatibant had no effect on the fertility of male mice and rats.
Icatibant did not elicit any cardiac conduction change in vitro (hERG channel) or in vivo in normal dogs or in various dog models (ventricular pacing, physical exertion and coronary ligation) where no associated hemodynamic changes were observed.
Icatibant has been shown to aggravate induced cardiac ischemia in several non-clinical models, although a detrimental effect has not consistently been shown in acute ischemia.

Further information
1.
WHAT FIRAZYR IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Firazyr is used for treating the symptoms of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult patients.
In HAE levels of a substance in your bloodstream called bradykinin are increased and this leads to symptoms like swelling, pain, nausea, and diarrhoea.
Firazyr blocks the activity of bradykinin and therefore ends the further progression of the symptoms of an HAE attack.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE FIRAZYR
Do not use Firazyr
- If you know that you are allergic (hypersensitive) to icatibant, or any of the other ingredients of
Firazyr.
Take special care with Firazyr
-
Some of the side effects connected with Firazyr are similar to the symptoms of your disease.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice that your symptoms of the attack get worse after you received Firazyr.
-
If you are suffering from angina (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), please consult your doctor before using Firazyr.
-
If you have recently suffered a stroke, please consult your doctor before using Firazyr.
Using other medicines
Firazyr is not known to interact with other medicines, but please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed by a doctor.
If you are taking a medicine known as an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (for
19 example: captopril, enalapril, ramipril, quinapril, lisinopril) which is used to lower your blood pressure or for any other reason, you should inform your doctor before receiving Firazyr.
Taking Firazyr with food and drink
Food and drink have no effect on the action of Firazyr.
Pregnancy and breast feeding
If you are pregnant or plan becoming pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use Firazyr.
If you are breast-feeding you should not breast-feed for 12 hours after you have received Firazyr.
Driving and using machines
Do not drive or use machinery if you feel tired or dizzy as a result of your HAE attack or after using Firazyr.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Firazyr
The injection solution contains less than 1 mmol (23 milligrams) of sodium, so it is essentially ‘ sodium-free’.
3.
HOW TO USE FIRAZYR
Firazyr will always be injected by your doctor or nurse.
Your doctor will tell you when it is safe for you to go home.
When and how often should you use Firazyr?
Your doctor has determined the exact dose of Firazyr and will tell you how often it should be used.
The recommended dose of Firazyr is one injection (3 ml, 30 mg) applied subcutaneously (under the skin) as soon as you notice the attack of hereditary angioedema becoming moderately or severely worse (for example increased skin swelling, particularly affecting the face and neck, or increasing tummy pain).
If you experience no relief of symptoms after 6 hours, an additional injection of Firazyr (3 ml) can be given.
If after a further 6 hours you still experience no relief you might have a third injection Firazyr (3 ml).
You should not have more than 3 injections in a 24 hour period and no more than 8 injections of Firazyr in total per month.
How should Firazyr be administered?
Firazyr is intended for subcutaneous injection (under the skin).
Each syringe should only be used once.
Firazyr is injected with a short needle into the fatty tissue under the skin in the abdomen (tummy).
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Firazyr can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Almost all patients receiving Firazyr will experience a reaction at the site of the injection.
The reaction may include burning sensations, reddening of the skin (erythema), pain, swelling, feeling of warmth and itching (pruritus).
These effects are usually mild and clear up by themselves without the need for any additional treatment.
20 The frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (affects more than 1 user in 10), common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100), uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000), rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000), very rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000), not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Very common:
Injection site reactions (burning sensations, reddening of the skin, pain, swelling, feeling of warmth, itching.) Common:
Abnormal results from some blood tests Blocked nose Headache Dizziness Muscle weakness Nausea Pain in the abdomen (tummy) Rash, skin redness Uncommon:
Asthma Bruising Cough Fever Hot flushes Increased amount of uric acid in the blood (indicator of gout) Itching Sore throat Positive test for protein in your urine Vomiting Tiredness Weight gain
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice that your symptoms of the attack get worse after you received Firazyr.
5.
HOW TO STORE FIRAZYR
