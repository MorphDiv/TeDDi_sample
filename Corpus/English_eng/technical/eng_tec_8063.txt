SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Kepivance 6.25 mg powder for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains 6.25 mg of palifermin.
Palifermin is a human keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli.
Reconstituted Kepivance contains 5 mg/ ml of palifermin.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder for solution for injection (powder for injection).
White lyophilised powder.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Kepivance is indicated to decrease the incidence, duration and severity of oral mucositis in patients with haematological malignancies receiving myeloablative therapy associated with a high incidence of severe mucositis and requiring autologous haemopoietic stem cell support.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Kepivance treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapy.
Adults
The recommended dosage of Kepivance is 60 micrograms/ kg/ day, administered as an intravenous bolus injection for three consecutive days before and three consecutive days after myeloablative therapy for a total of six doses (see below).
Kepivance should not be administered subcutaneously due to poor local tolerability.
Reconstituted Kepivance should not be left at room temperature for more than one hour, and should be protected from light.
Prior to administration, visually inspect the solution for discolouration and particulate matter before administration, see section 6.6.
Pre- myeloablative therapy:
The first three doses should be administered prior to myeloablative therapy, with the third dose 24 to 48 hours before myeloablative therapy.
Post- myeloablative therapy:
The last three doses should be administered post myeloablative therapy; the first of these doses should be administered after, but on the same day of haematopoietic stem cell infusion and at least four days after the most recent Kepivance administration.
See section 4.4.
2 Children and adolescents
The safety and efficacy of Kepivance in children and adolescent patients have not been established, Kepivance should not be used in children or adolescents until further data become available.
Renal impairment
Dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
Safety and efficacy has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Elderly
Safety and efficacy has not been evaluated in the elderly (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to palifermin or to any of the excipients, or to Escherichia coli-derived proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Kepivance should not be administered within 24 hours before, during infusion of, or within 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy.
In a clinical trial, administration of Kepivance within 24 hours of chemotherapy resulted in an increased severity and duration of oral mucositis.
If heparin is used to maintain an intravenous line, sodium chloride solution should be used to rinse the line prior to and after Kepivance administration, see section 6.2.
KGF receptors are known to be expressed on the lens of the eye.
To date no evidence of an increase in lens opacities has been observed in patients treated with Kepivance in clinical studies.
Long term effects are not yet known.
The long-term safety of Kepivance has not been fully evaluated with respect to overall survival, progression free survival and secondary malignancies.
Kepivance is a growth factor that stimulates the proliferation of KGF receptor expressing epithelial cells.
The safety and efficacy of Kepivance has not been established in patients with KGF receptor expressing non-haematological malignancies.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been conducted with Kepivance.
As a protein therapeutic, the risk for Kepivance to interact with other medicinal products is low.
In-vitro and in-vivo data suggests that palifermin binds to unfractionated as well as low molecular weight heparins, which should be used with care in patients who are concomitantly administered palifermin.
The clinical relevance is unclear.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of Kepivance in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive and developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
The potential risk to the human embryo or foetus is unknown.
Kepivance should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
3 It is not known whether Kepivance is excreted in human milk, therefore Kepivance should not be administered to women who are breast-feeding.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Safety data are based upon 650 patients with haematological malignancies enrolled in 3 randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies and a pharmacokinetic study.
Patients received Kepivance (n = 409) or placebo (n = 241) either before, or before and after, myelotoxic chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation and peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) support.
Adverse reactions were consistent with the pharmacologic action of Kepivance on skin and oral epithelium (see Table 1).
These reactions were primarily mild to moderate in severity and were reversible.
Median time to onset was 6 days following the first of 3 consecutive daily doses of Kepivance, with a median duration of 5 days.
The adverse reactions of pain and arthralgia were consistent with Kepivance treated patients having received less opioid analgesia than placebo-treated patients (see Table 2).
Table 1.
Adverse reactions occurring with â‰¥ 5% higher incidence with Kepivance compared to placebo
System organ class
Undesirable effect Very common (> 1/ 10)
Nervous system disorders Gastrointestinal disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders General disorders and administration site conditions
Taste perversion Mouth/ tongue thickness or discolouration Rash, pruritus and erythema Arthralgia Oedema, pain and fever
Haematopoietic recovery following PBPC infusion was
similar between patients who received
Kepivance or placebo, and there were no observed differences in disease progression or survival.
Kepivance may cause increased lipase and amylase levels in some patients with or without symptoms of abdominal pain or backache.
The incidences of these changes, presented for Kepivance relative to placebo, were: lipase (28% vs.
23%) and amylase (62% vs.
54%).
No overt cases of pancreatitis have been reported in this patient population.
Fractionation of increased levels of amylase revealed the increase to be predominantly salivary in origin.
Dose limiting toxicities were observed in 36% (5 of 14) patients receiving 6 doses of 80 micrograms/ kg/ day administered intravenously over 2 weeks (3 doses preceding and three doses following myeloablative therapy).
These events were consistent with those observed at the recommended dose but were generally more severe.
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of Kepivance: tongue disorder (e. g. redness, bumps, oedema); face oedema, and mouth oedema; hyperpigmentation of the skin; and anaphylactic/ allergic reactions.
4 4.9 Overdose
There is no experience with Kepivance doses greater than 80 micrograms/ kg/ day administered intravenously in patients over 2 weeks (3 doses preceding and 3 doses following myeloablative therapy).
For information on dose limiting toxicities see section 4.8.
A single dose of 250 micrograms/ kg has been administered intravenously to 8 healthy volunteers without severe or serious adverse effects.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Detoxifying agents for antineoplastic treatment, ATC code:
V03A F08.
Palifermin is a 140 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 16.3 kilodaltons.
It differs from endogenous human KGF in that the first 23 N-terminal amino acids have been deleted to improve protein stability.
Mechanism of Action
KGF is a protein that targets epithelial cells by binding to specific cell-surface receptors thereby stimulating proliferation, differentiation, and upregulation of cytoprotective mechanisms (eg, induction of antioxidant enzymes).
Endogenous KGF is an epithelial cell specific growth factor which is produced by mesenchymal cells and is naturally upregulated in response to epithelial tissue injury.
Pharmacology
Epithelial cell proliferation was assessed by Ki67 immunohistochemical staining in healthy subjects.
A 3-fold or greater increase in Ki67 staining was observed in buccal biopsies from 3 of 6 healthy subjects given palifermin at 40 micrograms/ kg/ day intravenously for 3 days, when measured 24 hours after the third dose.
Dose-dependent epithelial cell proliferation was observed 48 hours post-dosing in healthy subjects given single intravenous doses of 120 to 250 micrograms/ kg.
Clinical Studies
The palifermin clinical program in the setting of myelotoxic therapy requiring haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) support included 650 patients with haematologic malignancies enrolled in 3 randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies and a pharmacokinetic study.
Efficacy and safety of palifermin were established in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which patients received high-dose cytotoxic therapy consisting of fractionated total-body irradiation (12 Gy total dose), high-dose etoposide (60 mg/ kg), and high-dose cyclophosphamide (100 mg/ kg) followed by PBPC support for the treatment of haematological malignancies ((Non- Hodgkinâ€™ s Lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkinâ€™ s disease, Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL), Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), or multiple myeloma).
In this study, 212 patients were randomised and received either palifermin or placebo.
Palifermin was administered as a daily intravenous injection of 60 micrograms/ kg for 3 consecutive days prior to initiation of cytotoxic therapy and for 3 consecutive days following infusion of peripheral blood progenitor cells.
The main efficacy endpoint of the study was the number of days during which patients experienced severe oral mucositis (grade 3/ 4 on the World Health Organisation (WHO) scale).
Other endpoints
5 included the incidence, duration and severity of oral mucositis and the requirement for opioid analgesia.
There was no evidence of a delay in time to haematopoietic recovery in patients who received palifermin as compared to patients who received placebo.
The efficacy results are presented in Table 2.

Grade 1 = soreness/ erythema; Grade 2 = erythema, ulcers, can eat solids; Grade 3 = ulcers, requires liquid diet only; Grade 4 = alimentation not possible
In this Phase 3 clinical study, palifermin treated patients demonstrated significant benefits in patient-reported outcomes of mouth and throat soreness and its impact on swallowing, drinking, eating and talking.
These patient-reported outcomes were highly correlated to the clinician grading of oral mucositis using the WHO scale.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of palifermin were studied in healthy volunteers and patients with haematological malignancies.
After single intravenous doses of 20 to 250 micrograms/ kg (healthy volunteers) and 60 micrograms/ kg (cancer patients), palifermin exhibited rapid extravascular distribution In patients with haematological malignancies mean Vss was 5 l/ kg and mean clearance about 1300 ml/ hour/ kg with an average terminal half-life of approximately 4.5 hours.
Approximately dose-linear pharmacokinetics were observed in healthy volunteers after single dose administration up to 250 micrograms/ kg.
No accumulation of palifermin occurred after 3 consecutive daily doses of 20 and 40 micrograms/ kg (healthy volunteers) or 60 micrograms/ kg (cancer patients).
Inter-subject variability is high with a CV% of about 50% for CL and 60% for Vss
No gender-related differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of palifermin.
Mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-80 ml/ min) did not influence palifermin pharmacokinetics.
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min), clearance was decreased by 22% (n=5).
In patients with end-stage renal disease (requiring dialysis) palifermin clearance was
6 decreased by 10% (n=6).
The pharmacokinetic profile in paediatric and geriatric populations (age above 70 years), or in patients with hepatic insufficiency, has not been assessed.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Salient findings in toxicology studies in rat and monkey were generally attributable to the pharmacological activity of palifermin, specifically, proliferation of epithelial tissues.
In fertility/ general reproductive toxicity studies in rats, palifermin treatment was associated with systemic toxicity (clinical signs and/ or changes in body weight) and adverse effects on male and female reproductive/ fertility parameters at doses greater than or equal to 300 micrograms/ kg/ day.
No adverse effects on reproductive/ fertility parameters were observed at doses of up to 100 micrograms/ kg/ day.
These no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) doses were associated with systemic exposures up to 2.5 times greater than anticipated clinical exposure.
In embryo/ foetal development toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, palifermin treatment was associated with developmental toxicity (increased post-implantation loss, reduced litter size, and/ or reduced foetal weight) at doses of 500 and 150 micrograms/ kg/ day, respectively.
Treatment with these doses was also associated with maternal effects (clinical signs and/ or changes in body weight/ food consumption), suggesting that palifermin was not selectively toxic to development in either species.
No adverse developmental effects were observed in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 300 and 60 micrograms/ kg/ day, respectively.
These NOAEL doses were associated with systemic exposures (based on AUC) up to 9.7 and 2.1 times, respectively, anticipated clinical exposure.
Peri- and postnatal development has not been studied.
Palifermin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates epithelial cells through the KGF receptor.
Haematologic malignancies do not express the KGF receptor.
However, patients treated with chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy are at higher risk of developing secondary tumours some of which may express KGF receptors, and theoretically, be stimulated by KGF receptor ligands.
In a study to assess potential carcinogenicity in transgenic rasH2 mice, no treatment related increases in the incidence of neoplastic lesions were observed.

Further information
1.
WHAT KEPIVANCE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Kepivance should only be used in adults over the age of 18 years.
Kepivance contains the active substance palifermin which is a protein produced by biotechnology in a bacteria called Escherichia coli.
Palifermin is similar to the protein called keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) that is naturally made by your body in small amounts.
Palifermin acts in the same way as naturally occurring KGF by stimulating the growth of specific cells called epithelial cells that form the tissue lining of your mouth and digestive tract, as well as other tissues such as skin.
Kepivance is used to reduce the frequency, duration and severity of oral mucositis (soreness, dryness and inflammation of the mouth) and improve related symptoms in patients with haematological malignancies (blood cancers) receiving certain types of chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy requiring autologous haematopoietic stem cell support (cells from your own body that produce blood).
2.
BEFORE YOU USE KEPIVANCE
Do not use Kepivance:
â€¢ if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to paliferminâ€š any other ingredients of Kepivance, or to Escherichia coli derived proteins.
Taking other medicines
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed to you by a doctor.
18 Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Kepivance has not been tested in pregnant women.
It is important to tell your doctor if you:
â€¢ are pregnant;
â€¢ think you may be pregnant; or
â€¢ plan to get pregnant.
It is not known whether Kepivance is present in human milk.
Do not use Kepivance if you are breast- feeding.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
The effect of Kepivance on the ability to drive or use machinery is not known.
3.
HOW TO USE KEPIVANCE
As Kepivance is a powder it must be mixed with water for injections before being injected into a vein.
The usual dose is 60 micrograms of Kepivance per kilogram of bodyweight per day.
This is given as an intravenous injection (into a vein) for three days in a row before chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy and three days in a row after chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy for a total of six doses.
Before injectionâ€š Kepivance may be allowed to reach room temperature for a maximum of 1 hour but should be protected from light.
Kepivance left at room temperature for more than 1 hour must be disposed of.
Do not shake Kepivance.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Kepivance can have side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Very common (more than 1 in every 10 patients) side effects are: â€¢ skin rash, itching and redness (pruritus and erythaema); â€¢ an increase in the thickness in the mouth or tongue; â€¢ change in colour of the mouth or tongue; â€¢ generalised swelling (oedema); â€¢ pain; â€¢ fever; â€¢ aching joints (arthralgia); and â€¢ altered taste.
Other side effects seen in patients are: â€¢ redness, bumps or swelling of the tongue; â€¢ swelling (oedema) of the face or mouth; â€¢ darkening of an area of skin (hyperpigmentation); and â€¢ allergic reactions.
19 Some patients have had an increase in lipase and amylase levels (digestive enzymes) in their blood, which do not require treatment and usually return to normal after stopping treatment with Kepivance.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
