(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
The fdf_open() function opens a file with form data.
This file must contain the data as returned from a PDF form or created using fdf_create() and fdf_save().
You can process the results of a PDF form POST request by writing the data recieved in $HTTP_FDF_DATA to a file and open it using fdf_open().
Starting with PHP 4.3 you can also use fdf_open_string() which handles temporary file creation and cleanup for you.
Example 1.
Accessing the form data
?php / / Save the FDF data into a temp file $fdffp = fopen( "test.fdf", "w"); fwrite($fdffp, $HTTP_FDF_DATA, strlen($HTTP_FDF_DATA)); fclose($fdffp); / / Open temp file and evaluate data $fdf = fdf_open("test.fdf");... fdf_close($fdf);?
See also fdf_open_string(), fdf_close(), fdf_create() and fdf_save().
