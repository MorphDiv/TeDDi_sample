Introduction
When & konqueror; connects to a web site to retrieve information, some basic identifying information is sent to the web site in the form of a User Agent header.
Because of minor differences in the way that different web browsers function, web sites that rely too much on a single browser may sometimes not display as intended when viewed using another browser. Some web sites are smart enough to examine the contents of the user agent header and incorporate this information in the & HTML; code so that the content is displayed correctly regardless of the browser used.
However, you may find that some web sites refuse to function correctly unless you are using a browser recognized as proper by that site. In these cases, you may find it necessary to fool the web site by having & konqueror; report itself to be another browser by means of the user agent header.
Use
In this module you can configure the type of browser that & konqueror; will report itself to be. You can control this information by web site. Usually, the list box that is labeled Site Specific Identification will be empty, so that & konqueror; will always use its default useragent string.
You can disable the sending of a user agent entirely, by unchecking the Send identification check box. This may cause strange behavior on some sites, and may even deny you access to some websites, so disable this with caution.
To configure a new agent binding, press the New... button. Type the name of the server or a domain in the text box at the top of the dialog that pops up, which is labeled When browsing the following site.
Note that you can not use the wildcard character * in this text box. However, the string kde. org will match all hosts in the domain kde. org
After typing the name of the server, type in the identifying string in the next combo box, which is labeled Use the following identification:, or choose a string from the list. If you do n't choose a string from the list, you will need to know what a valid string from the browser looks like. For example, you could type Mozilla/ 4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.0).
You can click on an existing entry in the list, and then modify the contents of the text boxes, followed by clicking Change....
The Delete button can be used to delete the selected entry in the list of configured agent bindings. The Delete All will remove all the configured user agent strings. Click the Apply to take your changes in effect.
You can use the check boxes at the top of the screen to build a user agent that is uniquely yours, by choosing your own combination of operating system name and version, platform, processor type, and language.
In all cases, the user agent that is being sent by default is displayed in bold text at the top of the page.
KControl
In the field labeled Alias (description) you can enter a descriptive name for the configured binding, & eg; Netscape Navigator 4.75 on Linux for the useragent string Mozilla/ 4.75 (X11; U; Linux 2.2.14 i686).
