1/ 17 1.
NAME OF THE VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ZACTRAN 150mg/ ml solution for injection for cattle
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
One ml contains:
Active substance:
Gamithromycin
150 mg
Excipient:
Monothioglycerol
1 mg
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Solution for injection.
Colourless to pale yellow solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Cattle
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
Therapeutic and preventive treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) associated with Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni.
The presence of the disease in the herd should be established before preventive treatment.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to macrolide antibiotics or to any of the excipients.
Do not use the product simultaneously with other macrolides or lincosamides (see section 4.8).
Do not use in lactating cattle producing milk for human consumption.
Do not use in pregnant cows or heifers, which are intended to produce milk for human consumption, within 2 months of expected parturition.
4.4 Special warnings
None
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Use of the veterinary medicinal product should be based on susceptibility testing and take into account official and local policies on the use of antimicrobials in farm animals.
2/ 17 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
People with known hypersensitivity to the macrolide class should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
Gamithromycin may cause irritation to eyes or/ and skin.
Avoid contact with skin or eyes If eye exposure occurs, flush eyes immediately with clean water.
If skin exposure occurs, wash the affected area immediately with clean water.
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Wash hands after use.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
During clinical trials no treatment related abnormalities were observed except some transient injection site swellings.
Visible injection site swellings may develop in up to 45% of treated animals associated with occasional, slight pain evident for one day.
The swellings typically resolve within 3 to 14 days but may persist in some animals for up to 35 days after treatment.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Based on laboratory animal data, gamithromycin has not produced any evidence of selective developmental or reproductive effects.
The safety of gamithromycin during pregnancy and lactation has not been evaluated in cattle.
Use only according to the risk/ benefit assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Cross resistance may occur with other macrolides.
Avoid simultaneous administration of antimicrobials with a similar mode of action such as other macrolides or lincosamides.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
A single subcutaneous injection of 6 mg gamithromycin/ kg body weight (equivalent to 1 ml/ 25 kg body weight) in the neck.
For treatment of cattle over 250 kg body weight, divide the dose so that no more than 10 ml are injected at one site.
To ensure correct dosage body weight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Clinical studies have demonstrated the wide margin of safety for gamithromycin injection in cattle.
In a young adult cattle study, gamithromycin was administered by subcutaneous injection at 6, 18, and 30 mg/ kg (1, 3, and 5 times the recommended dose) and repeated three times at 0, 5 and 10 days (three times the recommended duration of use).
Injection site reactions were noted in a dose related manner.
4.11 Withdrawal period
Meat and offal:
64 days
Not permitted for use in lactating animals producing milk for human consumption.
Do not use in pregnant cows or heifers, which are intended to produce milk for human consumption, within 2 months of expected parturition.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Macrolides, ATCvet code:
QJ01FA95
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Gamithromycin is an azalide, 15-membered semisynthetic macrolide class antibiotic with uniquely positioned alkylated nitrogen at 7a-position of the lactone ring.
This special chemistry facilitates rapid absorption at physiological pH and a long duration of action at the target tissue, lung.
Macrolides in general have both bacteriostatic and bactericidal action mediated through disruption of bacterial protein synthesis.
Macrolides inhibit bacterial protein biosynthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit and by preventing peptide chain elongation.
The in vitro data show that gamithromycin acts in a bactericidal manner.
The broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of gamithromycin includes Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni, the bacterial pathogens most commonly associated with BRD.
The MIC and MBC data are reported from a representative sample of isolates from field materials within different geographic EU areas.

Three mechanisms are generally considered responsible for resistance to the macrolide class of compounds.
This is often referred to as MLSB resistance as it affects macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins.
The mechanisms involve the alteration of the ribosomal target site, the utilization of active efflux mechanism and the production of inactivating enzymes.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Gamithromycin administered subcutaneously into the neck of cattle at single dosage of 6 mg/ kg body weight, resulted in rapid absorption with peak plasma concentrations observed after 30 to 60 min with a long plasma half-life (> 2 days).
The bioavailability of the drug was > 98% with no gender differences.
The volume of distribution at steady-state was 25 l/ kg.
Gamithromycin levels in lung reached a maximum in less than 24 hr, with lung-to-plasma ratio of > 264 indicating that the drug was absorbed rapidly into the target tissue for BRD.
In vitro plasma protein binding studies determined that the mean concentration of the free drug was 74%.
Biliary excretion of the unchanged drug was the major route of elimination.
