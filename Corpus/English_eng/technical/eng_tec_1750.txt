TimeSerial function
TimeSerial Function [Run-time]
Calculates a serial time value for the specified hour, minute and second parameters that are passed as numerical values.
You can then use this value to calculate the difference between times.
Syntax:
TimeSerial (hour, minute, second)
Return value:
Date
Parameters:
hour:
An integer expression that indicates the hour of the time that is used to determine the serial time value.
Values in the range 0 to 23 are valid.
minute:
An integer expression that indicates the minute of the time that is used to determine the serial time value.
In general, use values in the range 0 to 59.
However, you can also use values that lie outside of this range, where the number of minutes influence the hour value.
second:
An integer expression that indicates the second of the time that is used to determine the serial time value.
In general, you can use values in the range 0 to 59.
However, you can also use values that lie outside of this range, where the number seconds influences the minute value.
Examples:
12, -5, 45 corresponds to 11, 55, 45
12, 61, 45 corresponds to 13, 2, 45
12, 20, -2 corresponds to 12, 19, 58
12, 20, 63 corresponds to 12, 21, 4
You can use the TimeSerial function to convert any time into a single value that you can use to calculate time differences.
The TimeSerial function returns the type Variant with VarType 7 (Date).
This value is stored internally as a double-precision number in the range 0 to 0.9999999999.
As opposed to the DateSerial or DateValue function, where the serial date values are calculated as days relative to a fixed date, you can calculate with values returned by the TimeSerial function, but you cannot evaluate them.
In the TimeValue function, you can pass a string as a parameter containing the time.
For the TimeSerial function, however, you can pass the individual parameters (hour, minute, second) as separate numerical expressions.
Example:
Sub ExampleTimeSerial
Dim dDate As Double, sDate As String
dDate = TimeSerial(8,30,15)
sDate = TimeSerial(8,30,15)
MsgBox dDate,64, &quot; Time as a number &quot;
MsgBox sDate,64, &quot; Formatted time &quot;
End Sub
