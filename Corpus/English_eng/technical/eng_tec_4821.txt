(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns the numeric position of the last occurrence of needle in the haystack string.
Note that the needle in this case can only be a single character.
If a string is passed as the needle, then only the first character of that string will be used.
If needle is not found, returns FALSE.
Note:
It is easy to mistake the return values for "character found at position 0" and "character not found ".
Here 's how to detect the difference:
/ / in PHP 4.0b3 and newer: $pos = strrpos( $mystring, "b"); if ($pos === false) {/ / note: three equal signs / / not found...} / / in versions older than 4.0b3: $pos = strrpos($mystring, "b"); if (is_string($pos) !$pos) {/ / not found...}
If needle is not a string, it is converted to an integer and applied as the ordinal value of a character.
See also strpos(), strrchr(), substr(), stristr(), and strstr().
