Your settings are insecure
Your IMAP and/or SMTP settings do not specify SSL or TLS. This means your username and password could be read by another person on the network. Are you sure you want to do this?

Unable to open the database for %s
There was an error opening the local mail database for this account. This is possibly due to corruption of the database file in this directory:

%s

Geary can rebuild the database and re-synchronize with the server or exit.

Rebuilding the database will destroy all local email and its attachments.

Unable to open local mailbox for %s
There was an error opening the local mail database for this account. This is possibly due to a file permissions problem.

Please check that you have read/write permissions for all files in this directory:

%s
The version number of the local mail database is formatted for a newer version of Geary. Unfortunately, the database cannot be "rolled back" to work with this version of Geary.

Please install the latest version of Geary and try again.
There was an error opening the local account. This is probably due to connectivity issues.

Please check your network connection and restart Geary.
