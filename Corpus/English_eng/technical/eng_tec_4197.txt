PHP Manual

(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
Executes a statement prepared with odbc_prepare() .Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
The array parameters_array only needs to be given if you really have parameters in your statement.
Parameters in parameter_array will be substituted for placeholders in the prepared statement in order.
Any parameters in parameter_array which start and end with single quotes will be taken as the name of a file to read and send to the database server as the data for the appropriate placeholder.
Note:
As of PHP 4.1.1, this file reading functionality has the following restrictions:
File reading is not subject to any safe mode or open-basedir restrictions.
This is fixed in PHP 4.2.0.
Remote files are not supported.
If you wish to store a string which actually begins and ends with single quotes, you must escape them or add a space or other non-single-quote character to the beginning or end of the parameter, which will prevent the parameter 's being taken as a file name.
If this is not an option, then you must use another mechanism to store the string, such as executing the query directly with odbc_exec()).
