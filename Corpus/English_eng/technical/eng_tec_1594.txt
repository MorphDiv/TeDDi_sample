Log function
Log Function [Run-time]
Returns the natural logarithm of a number.
Syntax:
Log (Number)
Return value:
Double
Parameters:
Number:
A numerical expression for which you want to calculate the natural logarithm.
The natural logarithm is the logarithm to the base e.
The constant e has an value of approximately 2.71828182845904...
You can calculate logarithms to any base (n) for any number (x) by dividing the natural logarithm of x by the natural logarithm of n, as follows:
Log n(x) = Log(x) / Log(n)
Example:
Sub ExampleLogExp
Dim a as Double
Dim const b1=12.345e12
Dim const b2=1.345e34
a=Exp( Log(b1)+Log(b2) )
MsgBox &quot; &quot; & a & chr(13) & (b1*b2) ,0, &quot; Multiplication by logarithm function &quot;
end sub
