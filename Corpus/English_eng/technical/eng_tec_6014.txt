KDE Network Folder Wizard
Introduction
The & knetattach; program, affectionately and hereafter known as the Network Folder Wizard, allows easy addition and integration of various network folders with your & kde; desktop. Please report any problems or feature requests for it to the & kde; bugs website.
Using & knetattach;
As you will see in the screenshot below, the Network Folder Wizard currently allows you to add four types of network folders: WebDav, & FTP;, & Microsoft; & Windows; (Samba) network drives and SSH.
Here's a screenshot of & knetattach;

Adding network folders
Network folders show up in a special location of & konqueror; called a virtual folder. This virtual folder is accessed by typing remote: / in & konqueror; Location bar. You will then be able to see any folders which have been previously added and you also will be able to use the wizard to add new ones.
The virtual folder with the Network Folder wizard
Speaking of wizards, the Network Folder Wizard aims at being very easy to use. After opening the wizard you must choose the type of network folder you would like to access. When you move on to the next screen you will just need to fill in the requested information. The final step is entering your username and login password for the network share you've chosen to access.
Below is a list of the information needed by the wizard to create the network folders. If an option is not available for a particular folder it does not have to be entered. & eg;. The Samba folders do not require a Port entry.
Name:
This is where you give a name to the network connection. It is limited only by your imagination (or alphabet).
Server:
This is the address of the server you are attempting to add. It can be an IP address or domain name.
Port:
Here you enter the port number you wish to connect to. The defaults are usually sufficient.
Not available for & Microsoft; & Windows; (Samba) folders.
Folder:
The path to the folder you wish to connect to should go here.
Create an icon for this remote folder
If this box is checked an icon will be created allowing access through the remote: / virtual folder. If it is not checked, a connection will be possible but it will not be accessible from remote: /.
The Recent connection: option allows you to re-connect to the last network mount point you connected to using the wizard whether an icon is created or not.
Use encryption
If checked the ability to make a secure connection will be enabled.
Available only for WebDav folders.
& knetattach; Walkthrough
This will be a quick walkthrough of the Network Folder Wizard. Do n't blink or you might miss it.
Below you see the main window of the Network Folder Wizard. It is here that we choose what type of folder we want to add or connect to. For the purposes of this walkthrough we will be using & FTP;. It contains most of the options you will encounter while using the wizard.
Here's a screenshot of the & knetattach; main window
OK, so we (as in me) have chosen to add an & FTP; folder. Below you see an example of the type of information you will need to add for your particular & FTP; server. After filling it in we press Save & Connect and wait for the magic. Oh yes, if your server requires validation of some kind you will be prompted at this point before being allowed to connect.

So now we are all connected now and able to navigate our newly added share. Joy!

To get back to our network folders all that is necessary is typing remote: / in the Location: bar of & konqueror;.

You can even add new folders from the same location by using the Add a Network Folder link. Well that brings us to the end of our walkthrough (told you it would be quick). I wish you the best of luck in your own network folder adventures; -)
