For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Solution for injection in a vial.
Clear colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
For the treatment of adults, adolescents and children of 6 years or above with diabetes mellitus, where treatment with insulin is required.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The potency of this preparation is stated in units.
These units are exclusive to Optisulin and are not the same as IU or the units used to express the potency of other insulin analogues.
See section 5.1 (Pharmacodynamics).
Optisulin contains insulin glargine an insulin analogue with a prolonged duration of action.
It should be administered once daily at any time but at the same time each day.
The dosage and timing of dose of Optisulin should be individually adjusted.
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Optisulin can also be given together with orally active antidiabetic medicinal products.
Children
In children efficacy and safety of Optisulin have only been demonstrated when given in the evening.
Due to limited experience the efficacy and safety of Optisulin have not been demonstrated in children below the age of 6 years.
Transition from other insulins to Optisulin
When changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin to a regimen with Optisulin, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the concomitant antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted (dose and timing of additional regular insulins or fast- acting insulin analogues or the dose of oral antidiabetic agents).
2 To reduce the risk of nocturnal and early morning hypoglycaemia, patients who are changing their basal insulin regimen from a twice daily NPH insulin to a once daily regimen with Optisulin should reduce their daily dose of basal insulin by 20-30% during the first weeks of treatment.
During the first weeks the reduction should, at least partially, be compensated by an increase in mealtime insulin, after this period the regimen should be adjusted individually.
As with other insulin analogues, patients with high insulin doses because of antibodies to human insulin may experience an improved insulin response with Optisulin.
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter.
With improved metabolic control and resulting increase in insulin sensitivity a further adjustment in dosage regimen may become necessary.
Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if the patient's weight or life-style changes, change of timing of insulin dose or other circumstances arise that increase susceptibility to hypo-or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4).
Administration
Optisulin is administered subcutaneously.
Optisulin should not be administered intravenously.
The prolonged duration of action of Optisulin is dependent on its injection into subcutaneous tissue.
Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycaemia.
There are no clinically relevant differences in serum insulin or glucose levels after abdominal, deltoid or thigh administration of Optisulin.
Injection sites must be rotated within a given injection area from one injection to the next.
Optisulin must not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted.
Mixing or diluting can change its time/ action profile and mixing can cause precipitation.
For further details on handling, see section 6.6.
Due to limited experience the efficacy and safety of Optisulin could not be assessed in the following groups of patients: patients with impaired liver function or patients with moderate/ severe renal impairment (see section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Optisulin is not the insulin of choice for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Instead, regular insulin administered intravenously is recommended in such cases.
Safety and efficacy of Optisulin have been established in adolescents and children of 6 years and above.
Due to limited experience the efficacy and safety of Optisulin could not be assessed in children below 6 years of age, in patients with impaired liver function or in patients with moderate/ severe renal impairment (see section 4.2).
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.
3 In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered.
Insulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form.
In rare cases, the presence of such insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.
(See section 4.8)
Hypoglycaemia
The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed.
Due to more sustained basal insulin supply with Optisulin, less nocturnal but more early morning hypoglycaemia can be expected.
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished.
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups.
These include patients:
- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved,
- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually,
- who are elderly,
- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin,
- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present,
- with a long history of diabetes,
- suffering from a psychiatric illness,
- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5).
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia.
The prolonged effect of subcutaneous insulin glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycaemia.
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered.
Adherence of the patient to the dosage and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.
Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment.
These include:
- change in the injection area,
- improved insulin sensitivity (by, e. g., removal of stress factors),
- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity,
- intercurrent illness (e. g. vomiting, diarrhoea),
- inadequate food intake,
- missed meals,
- alcohol consumption,
- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders, (e. g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or
adrenocortical insufficiency),
- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.
4 Intercurrent illness
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring.
In many cases urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose.
The insulin requirement is often increased.
Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin glargine.
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e. g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline) thyroid hormones, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e. g. clozapine and olanzapine) and protease inhibitors.
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose- lowering effect of insulin.
Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy For insulin glargine no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical trials are available.
A limited number of exposed pregnancies from Post Marketing Surveillance indicate no adverse effects of insulin glargine on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus and newborn child.
To date, no other relevant epidemiological data are available.
Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal / foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
The available clinical data is insufficient to exclude a risk.
The use of Optisulin may be considered in pregnancy, if necessary.
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy.
Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters.
Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia).
Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.
Lactation Lactating women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.
5 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment.
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e. g. driving a car or operating machinery).
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving.
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or operate machinery in these circumstances.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.
The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations were listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/ 10; common: ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10; uncommon: ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100; rare: ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000; very rare: < 1/ 10,000).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Metabolism and nutrition disorders
Very common:
Hypoglycaemia Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage.
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation.
Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.
Immune system disorders
Rare:
Allergic reaction Immediate-type allergic reactions to insulin are rare.
Such reactions to insulin (including insulin glargine) or the excipients may, for example, be associated with generalised skin reactions, angio- oedema, bronchospasm, hypotension and shock, and may be life-threatening.
Insulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form.
In clinical studies, antibodies that cross- react with human insulin and insulin glargine were observed with the same frequency in both NPH- insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups.
In rare cases, the presence of such insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.
Nervous system disorders Very rare:
Dysgeusia
Eyes disorders
Rare:
Visual impairment A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens.
Rare:
Retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.
In patients with proliferative retinopathy,
6 particularly if not treated with photocoagulation, severe hypoglycaemic episodes may result in transient amaurosis.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
As with any insulin therapy, lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption.
Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions.
Common:
Lipohypertrophy
Uncommon:
Lipoatrophy
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders
Very rare:
Myalgia
General disorders and administration site conditions
Common:
Injection site reactions Such reactions include redness, pain, itching, hives, swelling, or inflammation.
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Rare:
Oedema Rarely, insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.
Paediatric population
In general, the safety profile for patients ≤ 18 years of age is similar to the safety profile for patients > 18 years.
The adverse event reports received from Post Marketing Surveillance included relatively more frequent injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions (rash, urticaria) in patients ≤ 18 years of age than in patients > 18 years.
No clinical study safety data are available in patients below 6 years of age.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia.
Management
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates.
Adjustments in dosage of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed.
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/ subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose.
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antidiabetic agent.
Insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting.
ATC Code:
A10A E04.
Insulin glargine is a human insulin analogue designed to have a low solubility at neutral pH.
It is completely soluble at the acidic pH of the Optisulin injection solution (pH 4).
After injection into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralised leading to formation of micro-precipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine are continuously released, providing a smooth, peakless, predictable concentration/ time profile with a prolonged duration of action.
Insulin receptor binding:
Insulin glargine is very similar to human insulin with respect to insulin receptor binding kinetics.
It can, therefore, be considered to mediate the same type of effect via the insulin receptor as insulin.
The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism.
Insulin and its analogues lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production.
Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.
In clinical pharmacology studies, intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin have been shown to be equipotent when given at the same doses.
As with all insulins, the time course of action of insulin glargine may be affected by physical activity and other variables.
In euglycaemic clamp studies in healthy subjects or in patients with type 1 diabetes, the onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine was slower than with human NPH insulin, its effect profile was smooth and peakless, and the duration of its effect was prolonged.
The following graph shows the results from a study in patients:

8 The longer duration of action of insulin glargine is directly related to its slower rate of absorption and supports once daily administration.
The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogues such as insulin glargine may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual.
In a clinical study, symptoms of hypoglycaemia or counter-regulatory hormone responses were similar after intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin both in healthy volunteers and patients with type 1 diabetes.
Effects of Optisulin (once daily) on diabetic retinopathy were evaluated in an open-label 5-year NPH- controlled study (NPH given bid) in 1024 type 2 diabetic patients in which progression of retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale was investigated by fundus photography.
No significant difference was seen in the progression of diabetic retinopathy when Optisulin was compared to NPH insulin.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
In healthy subjects and diabetic patients, insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower and much more prolonged absorption and showed a lack of a peak after subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in comparison to human NPH insulin.
Concentrations were thus consistent with the time profile of the pharmacodynamic activity of insulin glargine.
The graph above shows the activity profiles over time of insulin glargine and NPH insulin.
Insulin glargine injected once daily will reach steady state levels in 2-4 days after the first dose.
When given intravenously the elimination half-life of insulin glargine and human insulin were comparable.
In man, insulin glargine is partly degraded in the subcutaneous tissue at the carboxyl terminus of the Beta chain with formation of the active metabolites 21A-Gly-insulin and 21A -Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin.
Unchanged insulin glargine and degradation products are also present in the plasma.
In clinical studies, subgroup analyses based on age and gender did not indicate any difference in safety and efficacy in insulin glargine-treated patients compared to the entire study population.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.

Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving.
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or operate machinery in these circumstances.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.
The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations were listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/ 10; common: ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10; uncommon: ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100; rare: ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000; very rare: < 1/ 10,000).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Metabolism and nutrition disorders
Very common:
Hypoglycaemia Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage.
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter-regulation.
Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.
Immune system disorders
Rare:
Allergic reaction Immediate-type allergic reactions to insulin are rare.
Such reactions to insulin (including insulin glargine) or the excipients may, for example, be associated with generalised skin reactions, angio- oedema, bronchospasm, hypotension and shock, and may be life-threatening.
Insulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form.
In clinical studies, antibodies that cross- react with human insulin and insulin glargine were observed with the same frequency in both NPH- insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups.
In rare cases, the presence of such insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.
Nervous system disorders:
Very rare:
Dysgeusia
16 Eyes disorders
Rare:
Visual impairment A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens.
Rare:
Retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.
In patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation, severe hypoglycaemic episodes may result in transient amaurosis.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
As with any insulin therapy, lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption.
Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions.
Common:
Lipohypertrophy
Uncommon:
Lipoatrophy
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders
Very rare:
Myalgia
General disorders and administration site conditions
Common:
Injection: site reactions Such reactions include redness, pain, itching, hives, swelling, or inflammation.
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Rare:
Oedema Rarely, insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.
Paediatric population
In general, the safety profile for patients ≤ 18 years of age is similar to the safety profile for patients > 18 years.
The adverse event reports received from Post Marketing Surveillance included relatively more frequent injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions (rash, urticaria) in patients ≤ 18 years of age than in patients > 18 years.
No clinical study safety data are available in patients below 6 years of age.
17 4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia.
Management
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates.
Adjustments in dosage of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed.
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/ subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose.
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antidiabetic agent.
Insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting.
ATC Code:
A10A E04.
Insulin glargine is a human insulin analogue designed to have a low solubility at neutral pH.
It is completely soluble at the acidic pH of the Optisulin injection solution (pH 4).
After injection into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralised leading to formation of micro-precipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine are continuously released, providing a smooth, peakless, predictable concentration/ time profile with a prolonged duration of action.
Insulin receptor binding:
Insulin glargine is very similar to human insulin with respect to insulin receptor binding kinetics.
It can, therefore, be considered to mediate the same type of effect via the insulin receptor as insulin.
The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism.
Insulin and its analogues lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production.
Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.
In clinical pharmacology studies, intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin have been shown to be equipotent when given at the same doses.
As with all insulins, the time course of action of insulin glargine may be affected by physical activity and other variables.
In euglycaemic clamp studies in healthy subjects or in patients with type 1 diabetes, the onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine was slower than with human NPH insulin, its effect profile was smooth and peakless, and the duration of its effect was prolonged.
18 The following graph shows the results from a study in patients:

End of observation Time (h) after s. c. injection period *determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels (hourly mean values)
The longer duration of action of insulin glargine is directly related to its slower rate of absorption and supports once daily administration.
The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogues such as insulin glargine may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual.
In a clinical study, symptoms of hypoglycaemia or counter-regulatory hormone responses were similar after intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin both in healthy volunteers and patients with type 1 diabetes.
Effects of Optisulin (once daily) on diabetic retinopathy were evaluated in an open-label 5-year NPH- controlled study (NPH given bid) in 1024 type 2 diabetic patients in which progression of retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale was investigated by fundus photography.
No significant difference was seen in the progression of diabetic retinopathy when Optisulin was compared to NPH insulin.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
In healthy subjects and diabetic patients, insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower and much more prolonged absorption and showed a lack of a peak after subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in comparison to human NPH insulin.
Concentrations were thus consistent with the time profile of the pharmacodynamic activity of insulin glargine.
The graph above shows the activity profiles over time of insulin glargine and NPH insulin.
Insulin glargine injected once daily will reach steady state levels in 2-4 days after the first dose.
When given intravenously the elimination half-life of insulin glargine and human insulin were comparable.
In man, insulin glargine is partly degraded in the subcutaneous tissue at the carboxyl terminus of the Beta chain with formation of the active metabolites 21A-Gly-insulin and 21A -Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin.
Unchanged insulin glargine and degradation products are also present in the plasma.
19 In clinical studies, subgroup analyses based on age and gender did not indicate any difference in safety and efficacy in insulin glargine-treated patients compared to the entire study population.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.

Further information
1.
WHAT OPTISULIN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Optisulin is a clear, colourless solution for injection containing insulin glargine.
Insulin glargine is a modified insulin, very similar to human insulin.
It is made by a biotechnology process.
Insulin glargine has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action.
Optisulin is used to reduce high blood sugar in adults, adolescents and children of 6 years or above with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE OPTISULIN
Do not use Optisulin
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin glargine or any of the other ingredients of Optisulin.
Take special care with Optisulin
Follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.
Special patient groups
There is limited experience with the use of Optisulin in children less than 6 years old and in patients whose liver or kidneys do not function well.
Travel
Before travelling consult your doctor.
You may need to talk about
- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- supplies of insulin, syringes etc.,
- correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
37
- the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited
- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.
Illnesses and injuries
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:
- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase
(hyperglycaemia).
- If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low
(hypoglycaemia).
In most cases you will need a doctor.
Make sure that you contact a doctor early.
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates.
Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin.
Using other medicines
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation).
In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high.
Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what action, if any, you need to take.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:
- all other medicines to treat diabetes,
- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors used to treat certain heart conditions
or high blood pressure),
- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),
- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),
- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),
-
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and
lower fever),
- sulfonamide antibiotics.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:
- corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation),
- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- somatropin (growth hormone),
- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol,
terbutaline used to treat asthma),
- thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders),
- atypical antipsychotic medications (such as clozapine, olanzapine),
- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV).
38 Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:
- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
-
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Using Optisulin with food and drink
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant.
Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth.
Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet.
Driving and using machines
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: − you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), − you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), − you have problems with your sight.
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or operating machinery).
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:
- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Optisulin
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i. e. it is essentially ‘ sodium-free’.
39 3.
HOW TO USE OPTISULIN
Dosage Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage, your doctor will:
- determine how much Optisulin per day you will need and at what time,
- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Optisulin..
Optisulin is a long-acting insulin.
Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels.
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level.
You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low.
See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.
Frequency of administration
You need one injection of Optisulin every day, at the same time of the day.
In children, only evening injection has been studied.
Method of administration
Optisulin is injected under the skin.
Do NOT inject Optisulin in a vein, since this will change its action and may cause hypoglycaemia.
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Optisulin.
With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.
How to handle the vials
Look at the vial before you use it.
Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike, and has no visible particles in it.
Do not shake or mix it before use.
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.
Do not mix Optisulin with any other insulins or medicines.
Do not dilute it.
Mixing or diluting may change the action of Optisulin.
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse.
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness.
If you think you may have a problem with Optisulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.
Mistakes in dosage
If you use more Optisulin than you should
- If you have injected too much Optisulin, your blood sugar level may become too low
(hypoglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar.
For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
If you forget to use Optisulin:
If you have missed a dose of Optisulin or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. - Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
40 If you stop using Optisulin This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).
Do not stop Optisulin without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Optisulin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious.
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life- threatening.
If you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately.
If you experience the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately: large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. These could be symptoms of severe allergic reactions to insulins and may become life- threatening.
Very common reported side effects (experienced in more than 1 in 10 patients) • Hypoglycaemia As with all insulin therapy, the most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia.
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means that there is not enough sugar in the blood.
For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.
Common reported side effects (experienced in more than 1 in 100 but less than 1 in 10 patients) • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.
Thickening of fatty tissue may occur in 1 to 2% of patients while shrinking may occur uncommonly.
Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well.
Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. • Skin and allergic reactions 3 to 4% of patients may experience reactions at the injection site (such as reddening, unusually intense pain on injection, itching, hives, swelling or inflammation).
They can also spread around the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Rare reported side effect (experienced in more than 1 in 10,000 but less than 1 in 1,000 patients) • Severe allergic reactions to insulins Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
These could be symptoms of severe allergic reactions to insulins and may become life-threatening. • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.
41 Other side effects include:
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin).
Rarely, this may require a change to your insulin dosage.
In rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling in the calves and ankles.
In very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur.
Paediatric patients
In general, the side effects in patients of 18 years of age or less are similar to those seen in adults.
Complaints of injection site reactions and skin reactions are reported relatively more frequently in patients of 18 years of age or less than in adult patients.
No clinical study safety data are available in patients below 6 years of age.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects.
To prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a side effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets worse rapidly.

44 HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for
example through incorrect storage,
- you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat and, glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia?
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur.
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you inject too much insulin,
- you miss meals or delay them,
- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other
medicines ").
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if
- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation (when changing
from your previous basal insulin to Optisulin hypoglycaemia, if it occurs, may be more likely to occur in the morning than at night),
- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
45
- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper
arm),
- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia
-In your body Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.
-In your brain Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if
- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Optisulin,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem.
Be familiar with your warning symptoms.
If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked.
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?
1.
Do not inject insulin.
Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage.
Caution:
Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.
2.
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta).
Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
The recovery of hypoglycaemia may be delayed because Optisulin has a long action.
3.
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4.
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar).
These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

Further information
1.
WHAT OPTISULIN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Optisulin is a clear, colourless solution for injection containing insulin glargine.
Insulin glargine is a modified insulin, very similar to human insulin.
It is made by a biotechnology process.
Insulin glargine has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action.
Optisulin is used to reduce high blood sugar in adults, adolescents and children of 6 years or above with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE OPTISULIN
Do not use Optisulin
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin glargine or any of the other ingredients of Optisulin.
Take special care with Optisulin
Follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.
Special patient groups
There is limited experience with the use of Optisulin in children less than 6 years old and in patients whose liver or kidneys do not function well.
47 Travel
Before travelling consult your doctor.
You may need to talk about
- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- supplies of insulin, syringes etc.,
- correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.
Illnesses and injuries
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care: − If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). − If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).
In most cases you will need a doctor.
Make sure that you contact a doctor early.
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates.
Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin.
Using other medicines
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation).
In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high.
Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other all medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what action, if any, you need to take.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: − all other medicines used to treat diabetes, − angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood pressure), − disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), − fluoxetine (used to treat depression), − fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), − monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), − pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever) − sulfonamide antibiotics.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: − corticosteroids (such as "cortisone"used to treat inflammation), − danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), − diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), − diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), − glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), − isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), − oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), − phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), − somatropin (growth hormone), − sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat asthma), − thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders),
48 − atypical antipsychotic medications (such as clozapine, olanzapine), − protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV).
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: − beta-blockers, (used to treat high blood pressure), − clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), − lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Using Optisulin with food and drink
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant.
Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth.
Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet.
Driving and using machines
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: − you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels) − you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels) − you have problems with your sight.
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or operating machinery).
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: − you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, − the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Optisulin
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i. e. it is essentially ‘ sodium free’.
49 3.
HOW TO USE OPTISULIN
Dosage Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin usage, your doctor will:
- determine how much Optisulin per day you will need and at what time,
- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Optisulin.
Optisulin is a long-acting insulin.
Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels.
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level.
You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low.
See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.
Frequency of administration
You need one injection of Optisulin every day, at the same time of the day.
In children, only evening injection has been studied.
Method of administration
Optisulin is injected under the skin.
Do NOT inject Optisulin in a vein, since this will change its action and may cause hypoglycaemia.
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Optisulin.
With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.
How to handle the cartridges
The cartridges are to be used in conjunction with an insulin pen such as OptiPen and other pens suitable for Optisulin cartridges, and as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer.
The manufacturer’ s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection.
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it in the pen.
Look at the cartridge before you use it.
Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike, and has no visible particles in it.
Do not shake or mix it before use.
Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse.
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness.
If you think you may have a problem with Optisulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.
Special care before injection
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen).
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.
Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.
Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge.
Do not mix Optisulin with any other insulins or medicines.
Do not dilute it.
Mixing or diluting may change the action of Optisulin.
50 Problems with the insulin pen?
Refer to the manufacturer’ s instructions for using the pen.
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used.
If the insulin pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into a syringe for injection.
Therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well.
However, use only injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 Units per millilitre.
Mistakes in dosage
If you use more Optisulin than you should
- If you have injected too much Optisulin, your blood sugar level may become too low
(hypoglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar.
For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
If you forget to use Optisulin
If you have missed a dose of Optisulin or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using Optisulin This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).
Do not stop Optisulin without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Optisulin can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) can be very serious.
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain damage and may be life- threatening.
If you have symptoms of low blood sugar, take actions to increase your blood sugar level immediately.
If you experience the following symptoms, contact your doctor immediately: large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
These could be symptoms of severe allergic reactions to insulins and may become life- threatening.
51 Very common reported side effects (experienced in more than 1 in 10 patients) • Hypoglycaemia As with all insulin therapy, the most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia.
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) means that there is not enough sugar in the blood.
For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.
Common reported side effects (experienced in more than 1 in 100 but less than 1 in 10 patients) • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.
Thickening of fatty tissue may occur in 1 to 2% of patients while shrinking may occur uncommonly.
Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well.
Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. • Skin and allergic reactions 3 to 4% of patients may experience reactions at the injection site (such as reddening, unusually intense pain on injection, itching, hives, swelling or inflammation).
They can also spread around the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Rare reported side effect (experienced in more than 1 in 10,000 but less than 1 in 1,000 patients) • Severe allergic reactions to insulins Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
These could be symptoms of severe allergic reactions to insulins and may become life-threatening. • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision.

54 HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for
example through incorrect storage,
- your insulin pen does not work properly,
- you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and, glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia?
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur.
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you inject too much insulin,
- you miss meals or delay them,
- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- you are recovering from an illness or fromfever,
- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other
medicines ").
55 Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if
- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation (when changing
from your previous basal insulin to Optisulin hypoglycaemia, if it occurs, may be more likely to occur in the morning than at night),
- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper
arm),
- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia
-In your body Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.
-In your brain Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if
- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Optisulin,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem.
Be familiar with your warning symptoms.
If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked.
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?
1.
Do not inject insulin.
Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage.
Caution:
Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.
2.
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta).
Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
The recovery of hypoglycaemia may be delayed because Optisulin has a long action.
3.
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4.
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.
56 Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar).
These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.
