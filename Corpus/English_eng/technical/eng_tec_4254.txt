Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
Returns 1 if the signature is correct, 0 if it is incorrect, and -1 on error.
openssl_verify() verifies that the signature is correct for the specified data using the public key associated with pub_key_id.
This must be the public key corresponding to the private key used for signing.
Example 1. openssl_verify() example
/ / $data and $signature are assumed to contain the data and the signature / / fetch public key from certificate and ready it $fp = fopen( "/ src / openssl-0.9.6 / demos / sign / cert.pem", "r"); $cert = fread($fp, 8192); fclose($fp); $pubkeyid = openssl_get_publickey($cert); / / state whether signature is okay or not $ok = openssl_verify($data, $signature, $pubkeyid); if ($ok == 1) echo "good"; elseif ($ok == 0) echo "bad"; else echo "ugly, error checking signature"; / / free the key from memory openssl_free_key($pubkeyid);
