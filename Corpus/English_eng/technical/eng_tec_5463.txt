php_stream_is() returns 1 if stream is of the type specified by istype, or 0 otherwise.
Table 43-1.
Values for istype
Value
Meaning
PHP_STREAM_IS_STDIO
The stream is implemented using the stdio implementation
PHP_STREAM_IS_SOCKET
The stream is implemented using the network stream implementation
PHP_STREAM_IS_USERSPACE
The stream is implemented using the userspace object implementation
PHP_STREAM_IS_MEMORY
The stream is implemented using the grow-on-demand memory stream implementation
Note:
The PHP_STREAM_IS_XXX "constants" are actually defined as pointers to the underlying stream operations structure.
If your extension (or some other extension) defines additional streams, it should also declare a PHP_STREAM_IS_XXX constant in it's header file that you can use as the basis of this comparison.
Note:
This function is implemented as a simple (and fast) pointer comparision, and does not change the stream state in any way.
See also php_stream_cast() and php_stream_can_cast().
