Glossary
This chapter is intended to explain the various words which have been used throughout the & krusader; documentation. If you believe some acronyms or terms are missing, please do not hesitate to contact the & krusader; documentation team.

ACL
Access Control List; a concept in computer security used to enforce privilege separation. It is a means of determining the appropriate access rights to a given object depending on certain aspects of the process that is making the request.
BSD

CVS
Concurrent Versions System; an important component of Source Configuration Management (SCM). By using it, developers can record the history of source files and documents.
DEB
This is a binary file format that is used by Debian and Debian -based distributions. It is a suffix of a installation file specifically built for these distributions; & eg; krusader_1.70.1-1_amd64. deb. Simply described it is a special archive containing all the program files and their proposed location on the system.
DCOP
Desktop Communication Protocol; the interprocess communication protocol used by & kde; desktop environment. It enables various & kde; applications to communicate with each other.
FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions; a document where questions that arise many times are answered. If you have a question to the developers of & krusader;, you should always have a look at the FAQ first.
& FTP;
File Transfer Protocol; it is an Internet protocol that allows you to retrieve files from so-called & FTP; servers.
GPL
GNU General Public License; a software license created by the Free Software Foundation defining the terms for releasing free software.
& GUI;
Graphical User Interface.
ISO
An ISO image (. iso) is an informal term for a disk image of an ISO 9660 file system. More loosely, it refers to any optical disk image, even a UDF image.
& kde;
K Desktop Environment; a project to develop a free graphical desktop environment for & UNIX; compatible systems.
Key Binding
All features of & krusader; are available through the menubar, but you can also bind (link) a certain key combination to that function. You will find, however, that using the keyboard is remarkably faster than using the menubar or GUI. Keyboard usage is an important tool for Orthodox File Managers. & krusader; comes with several predefined Key-Bindings.
Kpart
Kpart; KParts is the name of the component framework for the & kde; desktop environment. KParts are analogous to Bonobo components in GNOME, both of which are based on the same concepts as & Microsoft; 's Object Linking and Embedding. & eg; if you use & krusader; 's viewer to view a PDF file, KPDF wil be launched inside & krusader; 's viewer.
KIO or kioslave
KDE Input/ Output; also known as KIO Slaves is part of the & kde; architecture. It provides access to files, web sites and other resources through a single consistent API.
mount
Mounting; in computer science, is the process of making a file system ready for use by the operating system, typically by reading certain index data structures from storage into memory ahead of time. The term recalls a period in the history of computing when an operator had to mount a magnetic tape or hard disk on a spindle before using it.
OFM
Orthodox File Manager; also known as "Commanders". Members of this family of file managers use simple yet very powerful interface that is a direct derivative of the Norton Commander (NC) interface.
RPM
This is the binary file format for distributions based on the RPM Package Manager, a widely used packaging tool for the & Linux; operating system. If you still have to get & krusader; and your system supports RPM packages, you should get & krusader; packages ending in. rpm.

POSIX
"Portable Operating System Interface for uniX"; a collective name of a family of related standards specified by the IEEE to define the application programming interface (API) for software compatible with variants of the & UNIX; operating system.
& URL;
Universal Resource Locator; a universal resource locator is the technical term for what is commonly referred to as a websites address. Examples of URLs include http: / /krusader. sourceforge. net and Remote Connections.
VFS
Virtual file systems (VFS) is a basic OFM feature, this an abstracted layer over all kinds of archived information (ZIP files, FTP servers, TAR archives, NFS filesystems, SAMBA shares, ISO cd/ dvd images, RPM catalogs, etc.), which allows the user to access all the information in these divergent types of file systems transparently - just like entering an ordinary sub-directory! & krusader; supports several Virtual file systems (VFS).
XML
Extensible Markup Language; a very flexible text format derived from SGML (ISO 8879). Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere.
Zeroconf
Zeroconf; or Zero Configuration Networking is a set of techniques that automatically create a usable IP network without configuration or special servers. This allows inexpert users to connect computers, networked printers, and other items together and expect them to work automatically.
