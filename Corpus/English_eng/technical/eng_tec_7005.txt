Border Average
Example for the
Filter
This plug-in calculates the most often used color in a specified border of the active layer or selection. It can gather similar colors together so that they become predominant. The calculated color becomes the foreground color in the Toolbox. This filter is interesting when you have to find a Web page color background that differs as little as possible from your image border. The action of this filter is not registered in Undo History and can't be deleted with

Examples illustrating the
Original image: colors are pure Red (255;0;0), pure Blue (0;0;255), and different but similar kinds of Green ( 0;255;0 , 63;240;63 , 48;224;47 , 0;192;38 ).

The resulting color is a Red (254,2,2).
The bucket size is low. So the bucket number is high. All color shades can be stored in different buckets. Here, the bucket containing red is the most filled. The resulting color is a nearly pure Red (254,2,2) and becomes the foreground color of the Toolbox.

The resulting color is Green (32,224,32).
Here the bucket size is high, the number of buckets low. Similar colors (here green) are stored in a same bucket. This
