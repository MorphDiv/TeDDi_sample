In the event of a pump malfunction, patients must always have injection devices (injection syringe or pen) and insulin available for subcutaneous injection.
For details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps, refer to the operator’ s manual.
Intercurrent illness
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring.
In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose.
The insulin requirement is often increased.
Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin.
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics.
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e. g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e. g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e. g. olanzapine and clozapine).
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose- lowering effect of insulin.
Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.
293 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
For insulin human, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Insulin does not cross the placental barrier.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy.
Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and third trimesters.
Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of hypoglycaemia).
Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential.
Lactation
No effects on the suckling child are anticipated.
Insuman Infusat can be used during breastfeeding.
Lactating women may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment.
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e. g. driving a car or operating machinery).
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving.
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
It should be considered whether it is advisable to drive or operate machinery in these circumstances.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Hypoglycaemia, in general the most frequent undesirable effect of insulin therapy, may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.
In clinical trials and during marketed use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens.
Therefore, no specific frequency can be presented.
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage.
Prolonged or severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening.
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic counter- regulation.
Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms.
The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
294 Immune system disorders
Uncommon: shock Not known: immediate type allergic reactions (hypotension, angioneurotic oedema, bronchospasm, generalised skin reactions), anti-insulin antibodies
Immediate type allergic reactions to insulin or to the excipients may be life-threatening.
Insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form.
In rare cases, the presence of such anti- insulin antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemia.
Metabolism and nutrition disorders
Common: oedema Not known: sodium retention
Insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.
Eyes disorders
Not known: proliferative retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, visual impairment
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens.
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Not known: lipodystrophy
As with any insulin therapy, lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin absorption.
Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions.
General disorders and administration site conditions
Common: injection site reactions Uncommon: injection site urticaria Not known: injection site inflammation, injection site swelling, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site erythema.
Most minor reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia.
295 Management
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates.
Adjustments in dosage of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed.
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/ subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose.
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antidiabetic agent.
Insulins and analogues, fast-acting, ATC Code:
A10AB01.
Mode of action
Insulin
- lowers blood glucose and promotes anabolic effects as well as decreasing catabolic effects,
- increases the transport of glucose into cells as well as the formation of glycogen in themuscles and
the liver, and improves pyruvate utilisation.
It inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis,
- increases lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and inhibits lipolysis,
- promotes the uptake of amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis,
- enhances the uptake of potassium into cells.
Pharmacodynamic characteristics
Insuman Infusat is an insulin with rapid onset and short duration of action.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
In healthy subjects, the serum half-life of insulin is approximately 4 to 6 minutes.
It is longer in patients with severe renal insufficiency.
However, it must be noted that the pharmacokinetics of insulin do not reflect its metabolic action.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The acute toxicity was studied following subcutaneous administration in rats.
No evidence of toxic effects was found.
Local tolerability studies following subcutaneous and intramuscular administration in rabbits gave no remarkable findings.
Studies of pharmacodynamic effects following subcutaneous administration in rabbits and dogs revealed the expected hypoglycaemic reactions.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Insuman Infusat 100 IU/ ml solution for injection in a cartridge
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each ml contains 100 IU insulin human (equivalent to 3.5 mg).
Each cartridge contains 3.15 ml of solution for injection, equivalent to 315 IU insulin.
One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.
Insuman Infusat is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin).
Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Solution for injection in a cartridge.
Clear, colourless solution of water-like consistency.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Insuman Infusat has been specially designed for use in external portable insulin pumps.
It is specially stabilised to minimise loss of efficacy which may result from mechanical and thermal stress in such pumps.
Insuman Infusat is therefore also suitable for continuous insulin infusion with other, conventional injection syringe pumps.
The desired blood glucose levels and the insulin dosage must be determined individually and adjusted to suit the patient's diet, physical activity and life-style.
Daily doses and timing of administration
When used in external portable insulin pumps, part of the daily insulin dose is infused continuously ("basal rate"), and the rest is administered in the form of bolus injections before meals.
Refer to the operating instructions for detailed information about the infusion pump, its functions and the necessary safety precautions.
There are no fixed rules for insulin dosage.
However, the average insulin requirement is often 0.5 to 1.0 IU per kg body weight per day.
The basal metabolic requirement is 40% to 60% of the total daily requirement.
Consequently, about 40% to 60% of the daily dose is administered at a basal rate, and the rest is given as bolus injections before meals.
299 Transfer to Insuman Infusat
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another.
This applies, for example, when transferring from:
- an animal insulin (especially a bovine insulin) to human insulin,
- one human insulin preparation to another,
- a regimen with only regular insulin to one with a longer-acting insulin.
The need to adjust (e. g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.
Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.
Following transfer from an animal insulin to human insulin, dosage reduction may be required in particular in patients who
- were previously already controlled on rather low blood glucose levels,
- have a tendency to hypoglycaemia,
- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the transition and in the initial weeks thereafter.
In patients who require high insulin doses because of the presence of insulin antibodies, transfer under medical supervision in a hospital or similar setting must be considered.
Secondary dose adjustment
Improved metabolic control may result in increased insulin sensitivity, leading to a reduced insulin requirement.
Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if
- the patient's weight changes,
- the patient's life-style changes,
- other circumstances arise that may promote an increased susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia
(see section 4.4).
Use in specific patient groups
In patients with hepatic or renal impairment as well as in the elderly, insulin requirements may be diminished (see section 4.4).
Administration
Insuman Infusat in cartridges may be infused by the subcutaneous route.
It is designed for use in the Hoechst Infusor and H-Tron insulin pumps.
It may also be used in other insulin pumps for which it has been shown that they are suitable for this insulin and this type of cartridge (see pump manual).
Only tetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene catheters must be used.
Insulin must always be infused under aseptic conditions.
This is facilitated by the special equipment available for the insulin pumps (e. g. catheters, cannulas).
Insulin absorption and hence the blood glucose lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e. g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh).
The puncture site within a given injection area must be changed regularly (generally, every 1 to 3 days).
For further details on handling, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Insuman Infusat must not be used in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing.
Refer to the technical manual for contraindications relating to the use of insulin pumps.
300 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Patients hypersensitive to Insuman Infusat for whom no better tolerated preparation is available must only continue treatment under close medical supervision and – where necessary – in conjunction with anti- allergic treatment.
In patients with an allergy to animal insulin intradermal skin testing is recommended prior to a transfer to Insuman Infusat, since they may experience immunological cross-reactions.
In case of hypoglycaemia, the insulin pump should temporarily be turned off, at least until the patient has recovered complete consciousness.
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin metabolism.
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin requirements.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered.
Hypoglycaemia
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycaemia).
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are diminished.
The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be absent in certain risk groups.
These include patients:
- in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved,
- in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually,
- who are elderly,
- after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin,
- in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present,
- with a long history of diabetes,
- suffering from a psychiatric illness,
- receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5).
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia.
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered.
301 Adherence of the patient to the dosage and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.
Factors increasing the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustment.
These include:
- change in the injection area,
- improved insulin sensitivity (by, e. g., removal of stress factors),
- unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity,
- intercurrent illness (e. g. vomiting, diarrhoea),
- inadequate food intake,
- missed meals,
- alcohol consumption,
- certain uncompensated endocrine disorders (e. g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or
adrenocortical insufficiency),
- concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products.
Insulin pump faults
Hyperglycaemia, ketoacidosis and coma may develop within hours if the pump catheter is obstructed completely.
Whenever the patient notices a rapid increase in blood glucose which does not respond to a bolus dose, a check must be made for possible catheter obstruction.
In the event of a pump malfunction, patients must always have injection devices (injection syringe or pen) and insulin available for subcutaneous injection.
For details on safety precautions in the use of insulin pumps, refer to the operator’ s manual.
Intercurrent illness
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring.
In many cases, urine tests for ketones are indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose.
The insulin requirement is often increased.
Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. and they must never omit insulin entirely.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of human insulin.
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics.
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens (e. g. in oral contraceptives), phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e. g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e. g. olanzapine and clozapine).
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood-glucose- lowering effect of insulin.
Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.

Further information
1.
WHAT INSUMAN RAPID IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Insuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein (blood vessel).
The insulin contained in Insuman Rapid is made by a biotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin.
Insuman Rapid is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and short duration of action.
Insuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patents with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.
Insuman Rapid may also be used for treating severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build- up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling blood sugar before, during and after surgery.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE INSUMAN RAPID
Do not use Insuman Rapid
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin or any of the other ingredients of Insuman Rapid.
Do not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps – special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices.
Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing.
Take special care with Insuman Rapid
Follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.
Special patient groups
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.
425 Travel
Before travelling, consult your doctor.
You may need to talk about
- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.
Illnesses and injuries
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:
- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).
In most cases you will need a doctor.
Make sure that you contact a doctor early.
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates.
Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin.
Using other medicines
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation).
In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high.
Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:
- all other medicines to treat diabetes,
- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high
blood pressure),
- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),
- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),
- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),
- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- sulfonamide antibiotics.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:
- corticosteroids (such as "cortisone", used to treat inflammation),
- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- somatropin (growth hormone),
-
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline treat asthma),
used to
- -
thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders), protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
426
-
atypical antipsychotic medications (such as olanzapine and clozapine).
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:
- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Using Insuman Rapid with food and drink
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant.
Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth.
Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women.
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet.
Driving and using machines
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:
- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels),
- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels),
- you have problems with your sight.
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or operating machinery).
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:
- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i. e. it is essentially ‘ sodium- free’.
3.
HOW TO USE INSUMAN RAPID
Dosage
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will
- determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need,
- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid.
427 Many factors may influence your blood sugar level.
You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low.
See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.
Frequency of administration
Insuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal.
Method of administration
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin.
With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.
Insulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires experience and special safety precautions.
For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar setting.
How to handle the vials
Insuman Rapid contains 100 IU insulin per ml.
Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used.
The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin).
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial.
Insuman Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and has a water-like consistency.
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form.
Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose.
Special care before injection
Before injection remove any air bubbles.
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.
Insuman Rapid may be mixed with all Sanofi-Aventis human insulin preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps.
Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix Sanofi-Aventis human insulins.
If you need to inject a mixture, draw Insuman Rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin.
Inject as soon as you have mixed them.
Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).
Mistakes in dosage
If you use more Insuman Rapid than you should
- If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low
(hypoglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar.
For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
If you forget to use Insuman Rapid
- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood
sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
428 If you stop using Insuman Rapid This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).
Do not stop Insuman Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Insuman Rapid can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
As with all insulin therapy, the most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.
Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening.
Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
Side effects reported commonly (Seen in less than 1 in 10 but more than 1 in 100 patients) • Oedema Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles. • Injection site reactions
Side effects reported uncommonly (Seen in less than 1 in 100 but more than 1 in 1000 patients) • Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) • Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)
Other side effects include • Systemic allergic reactions Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturbyour vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.
Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well.
Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. • Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur.
They can also spread around the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin).
However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects.
To prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a side effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets worse rapidly.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for
example through incorrect storage,
- you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you
have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur.
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you inject too much insulin,
- you miss meals or delay them,
- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances
similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other
medicines ").
432 Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:
- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia
- In your body
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.
- In your brain
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if
- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem.
Be familiar with your warning symptoms.
If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked.
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia
1.
Do not inject insulin.
Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage.
Caution:
Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.
2.
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta).
Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
3.
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4.
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar).
These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

Further information
1.
WHAT INSUMAN RAPID IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Insuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein (blood vessel).
The insulin contained in Insuman Rapid is made by a biotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin.
Insuman Rapid is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and short duration of action.
Insuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.
Insuman Rapid may also be used for treating severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build- up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling blood sugar before, during and after surgery.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE INSUMAN RAPID
Do not use Insuman Rapid
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin or any of the other ingredients of Insuman Rapid.
Do not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps – special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices.
Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing.
Take special care with Insuman Rapid
Follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.
Special patient groups
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.
434 Travel
Before travelling, consult your doctor.
You may need to talk about
- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.
Illnesses and injuries
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:
- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).
In most cases you will need a doctor.
Make sure that you contact a doctor early.
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates.
Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin.
Using other medicines
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation).
In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high.
Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:
- all other medicines to treat diabetes,
- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood
pressure),
- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),
- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),
- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),
- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- sulfonamide antibiotics.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:
- corticosteroids (such as "cortisone", used to treat inflammation),
- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- somatropin (growth hormone),
- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to
treat asthma),
- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
435
- atypical antipsychotic medications (such as olanzapine and clozapine).
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:
- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Using Insuman Rapid with food and drink
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant.
Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth.
Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women.
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet.
Driving and using machines
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:
- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels),
- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels),
- you have problems with your sight.
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or operating machinery).
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:
- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i. e. it is essentially ‘ sodium- free’.
3.
HOW TO USE INSUMAN RAPID
Dosage
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will
- determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need,
- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid.
436 Many factors may influence your blood sugar level.
You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low.
See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.
Frequency of administration
Insuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal.
Method of administration
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin.
With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.
Insulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires experience and special safety precautions.
For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar setting.
How to handle the vials
Insuman Rapid contains 40 IU insulin per ml.
Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (40 IU per ml) must be used.
The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin).
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial.
Insuman Rapid must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and has a water-like consistency.
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could cause froth to form.
Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose.
Special care before injection
Before injection remove any air bubbles.
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.
Insuman Rapid may be mixed with all Sanofi-Aventis human insulin preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps.
Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix Sanofi-Aventis human insulins.
If you need to inject a mixture, draw Insuman Rapid into the injection syringe before the other insulin.
Inject as soon as you have mixed them.
Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).
Mistakes in dosage
If you use more Insuman Rapid than you should
- If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too
low(hypoglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar.
For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
If you forget to use Insuman Rapid
- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
437 If you stop using Insuman Rapid This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).
Do not stop Insuman Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Insuman Rapid can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
As with all insulin therapy, the most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.
Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening.
Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
Side effects reported commonly (Seen in less than 1 in 10 but more than 1 in 100 patients) • Oedema Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles. • Injection site reactions
Side effects reported uncommonly (Seen in less than 1 in 100 but more than 1 in 1000 patients) • Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) • Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)
Other side effects include • Systemic allergic reactions Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.
Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well.
Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. • Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur.
They can also spread around the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin).
However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects.
To prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a side effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets worse rapidly.
438 5.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for
example through incorrect storage,
- you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you
have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur.
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.

- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other

In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem.
Be familiar with your warning symptoms.
If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked.
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia
1.
Do not inject insulin.
Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage.
Caution:
Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.
2.
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta).
Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
3.
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4.
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar).
These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

Further information
1.
WHAT INSUMAN RAPID IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Insuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumstances, into a vein (blood vessel).
The insulin contained in Insuman Rapid is made by a biotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin.
Insuman Rapid is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and short duration of action.
It comes in cartridges designed for use in an injection device of the OptiPen series.
Insuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.
Insuman Rapid may also be used for treating severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build- up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling blood sugar before, during and after surgery.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE INSUMAN RAPID
Do not use Insuman Rapid
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin or any of the other ingredients of Insuman Rapid.
Do not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices.
Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing.
Take special care with Insuman Rapid
Follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.
443 Special patient groups
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.
Travel
Before travelling, consult your doctor.
You may need to talk about
- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.
Illnesses and injuries
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:
- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).
In most cases you will need a doctor.
Make sure that you contact a doctor early.
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates.
Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin.
Using other medicines
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation).
In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high.
Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:
- all other medicines to treat diabetes,
- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions orhigh blood
pressure),
- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),
- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),
- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),
- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- sulfonamide antibiotics.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:
- corticosteroids (such as "cortisone", used to treat inflammation),
- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
444
- somatropin (growth hormone),
- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to
treat asthma),
- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- atypical antipsychotic medications (such as olanzapine and clozapine).
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:
- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Using Insuman Rapid with food and drink
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant.
Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth.
Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women.
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet.
Driving and using machines
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:
- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels),
- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels),
- you have problems with your sight.
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or operating machinery).
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:
- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i. e. it is essentially ‘ sodium- free’.
445 3.
HOW TO USE INSUMAN RAPID
Dosage
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will
- determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need,
- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid.
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level.
You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low.
See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.
Frequency of administration
Insuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal.
Method of administration
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin.
With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.
Insulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires experience and special safety precautions.
For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar setting.
How to handle the cartridges
The cartridges are to be used in conjunction with an insulin pen such as OptiPen and other pens suitable for Insuman cartridges and as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer.
The manufacturer’ s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection.
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen.
Look at the cartridge before you use it.
Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and has a water-like consistency.
Special care before injection
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen).
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.
- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.
- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge.
- Do not mix Insuman Rapid with any other medicines.
Problems with the pen?
Refer to the manufacturer’ s instructions for using the pen.
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used.
If the pen does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe.
Therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well.
However, use only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml.
Mistakes in dosage
446 If you use more Insuman Rapid than you should
- If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low
(hypoglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar.
For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
If you forget to use Insuman Rapid
- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using Insuman Rapid This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).
Do not stop Insuman Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Insuman Rapid can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
As with all insulin therapy, the most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.
Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening.
Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
Side effects reported commonly (Seen in less than 1 in 10 but more than 1 in 100 patients) • Oedema Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles. • Injection site reactions
Side effects reported uncommonly (Seen in less than 1 in 100 but more than 1 in 1000 patients) • Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) • Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)
Other side effects include • Systemic allergic reactions Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy)
447 If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.
Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well.
Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. • Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur.
They can also spread around the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin).
However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects.
To prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a side effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets worse rapidly.
5.
HOW TO STORE INSUMAN RAPID

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for
example through incorrect storage,
- your insulin pen does not work properly,
- you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you
have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur.
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.
450 Why does hypoglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you inject too much insulin,
- you miss meals or delay them,
- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances
similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other
medicines ").
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:
- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia
- In your body
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.
- In your brain
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if
- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem.
Be familiar with your warning symptoms.
If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked.
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia
1.
Do not inject insulin.
Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage.
Caution:
Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.
451 2.
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta).
Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
3.
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4.
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar).
These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.

Using Insuman Rapid with food and drink
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant.
Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth.
Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women.
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet.
Driving and using machines
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:
- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels),
- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels),
- you have problems with your sight.
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or operating machinery).
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:
- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i. e. it is essentially ‘ sodium- free’.

HOW TO USE INSUMAN RAPID
Dosage
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will
- determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need,
- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid.
455 Many factors may influence your blood sugar level.
You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low.
See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.
Frequency of administration
Insuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal.
Method of administration
OptiSet delivers insulin in increments of 2 units up to a maximum single dose of 40 units.
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin.
With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.
How to handle OptiSet
Insuman Rapid comes in cartridges sealed in disposable pen injectors, OptiSet.
Read carefully the "OptiSet Instructions for Use" included in this package leaflet.
You must use the pen as described in these Instructions for Use.
A new injection needle must be attached before each use.
Only use needles that have been approved for use with OptiSet.
A safety test must be performed before each injection.
Look at the cartridge before you use the pen.
Do not use Insuman Rapid if you notice particles in it.
Only use Insuman Rapid if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike.
Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse.
If you think you may have a problem with OptiSet, refer to the Questions and Answers section of the attached OptiSet Instructions for Use, or have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, each pen must be used by one patient only.
Special care before injection
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.
Insuman Rapid pre-filled pen, OptiSet, is not designed to allow any other insulin to be mixed in the cartridge.
Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded.
Do not use the OptiSet if it is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects), it has to be discarded and a new OptiSet has to be used.
Mistakes in dosage
If you use more Insuman Rapid than you should
- If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low
(hypoglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar.
For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
456 If you forget to use Insuman Rapid
- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using Insuman Rapid This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).
Do not stop Insuman Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Insuman Rapid can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
As with all insulin therapy, the most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.
Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening.
Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
Side effects reported commonly (Seen in less than 1 in 10 but more than 1 in 100 patients) • Oedema Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles. • Injection site reactions
Side effects reported uncommonly (Seen in less than 1 in 100 but more than 1 in 1000 patients) • Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) • Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)
Other side effects include • Systemic allergic reactions Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.
Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well.
Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. • Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur.
They can also spread around the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
457 Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin).
However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects.
To prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a side effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets worse rapidly.
5.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for
example through incorrect storage,
- your insulin pen does not work properly,
- you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you
have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur.
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.
460 Why does hypoglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you inject too much insulin,
- you miss meals or delay them,
- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances
similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other
medicines ").
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:
- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia
- In your body
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.
- In your brain
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if
- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem.
Be familiar with your warning symptoms.
If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked.
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.
461 What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia
1.
Do not inject insulin.
Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage.
Caution:
Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.
2.
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta).
Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
3.
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4.
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar).
These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.
462 OPTISET INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
OptiSet is a disposable pen for the injection of insulin.
Doses from 2 to 40 units can be set in steps of 2 units.
Talk with your healthcare professional about proper injection technique before using OptiSet.
Read these instructions carefully before using your OptiSet.
If you are not able to follow all the instructions completely on your own, use OptiSet only if you have help from a person who is able to follow the instructions.
If you have any questions about OptiSet or about diabetes, ask your healthcare professional or call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet.
Keep this leaflet for future reference each time you use OptiSet.
Ne w information for use: • Name of the insulin is printed on the pen. • Dosage selector can only be turned in one direction.
Important information for use of OptiSet:
• Always attach a new needle before each use.
Only use needles that are compatible for use with OptiSet. • Always perform the safety test before each injection. • If you are using a new OptiSet the initial safety test must be done with the 8 units preset by the manufacturer. • The dosage selector can only be turned in one direction. • Never turn the dosage selector (i. e. never change the dose) after injection button has been pulled out. • This pen is only for your use.
Do not share it with anyone else. • If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. • Never use OptiSet if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. • Always have a spare OptiSet in case your OptiSet is lost or damaged.
Step 1.
Check the insulin
A.
Take off the pen cap.
B.
Check the label on the pen and insulin reservoir to make sure you have the correct insulin.
C.
Insuman Rapid is a clear insulin.
Do not use this OptiSet if the insulin is cloudy, coloured or has particles.
463 Step 2.
Attach the needle
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection.
This helps prevent contamination, and potential needle blocks.
A.
Remove the protective seal from a new needle.
B.
Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type).
• If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or the needle can be bent.
Step 3.
Perform a safety test
Always perform the safety test before each injection.
This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: • making sure that pen and needle work properly • removing air bubbles If you are using a new OptiSet the initial safety test must be done with the 8 units preset by the manufacturer, otherwise the pen will not function properly.
A.
Make sure the injection button is pressed in.
B.
Select the dose for the Safety Test. • New and unused OptiSet: a dose of 8 units is already preset by the manufacturer for the first safety test. • In-use OptiSet: select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector forward till the dose arrow points to 2.
The dosage selector will only turn in one direction.
464 C.
Pull out the injection button completely in order to load the dose.
Never turn the dosage selector after injection button has been pulled out.
D.
Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection.
Take off the inner needle cap and discard it.
keep
discard
E.
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards.
F.
Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.
G.
Press the injection button all the way in.
Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip.
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. • If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times. • If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked.
Change the needle and try again. • If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your OptiSet may be damaged.
Do not use this OptiSet.
Step 4.
Select the dose
You can set the dose in steps of 2 units, from a minimum of 2 units to a maximum of 40 units.
If you need a dose greater than 40 units, you should give it as two or more injections.
A.
Check if you have enough insulin for your dose.
• The residual insulin scale on the transparent insulin reservoir shows approximately how much insulin remains in the OptiSet.
This scale must not be used to set the insulin dose.
• If the black plunger is at the beginning of the coloured bar, then there are approximately 40 units of insulin available.
465 • If the black plunger is at the end of the coloured bar, then there are approximately 20 units of insulin available.
B.
Select your required dose by turning the dose selector forward.
If you turned past your dose, • and you have not yet pulled the injection button, you can keep turning forward till you reach your dose again, • and you have already pulled the injection button out, you must discard the dose that has been loaded before you turn the dosage selector again.
Step 5.
Load the dose
A.
Pull out the injection button completely in order to load the dose.
B.
Check if the selected dose is fully loaded.
Note that the injection button only goes out as far as the amount of insulin that is left in the reservoir. • The injection button must be held out under tension during this check. • The last thick line visible on the injection button shows the amount of insulin loaded.
When the injection button is held out only the top part of this thick line can be seen. • In this example, 12 units are loaded.
o o
if you have selected 12 units you can inject your dose. if you have selected more than 12 units then only 12 units of your total insulin dose can be injected with this pen.
In this case what should you do: • either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new OptiSet. • or use a new OptiSet for your full dose.
Step 6.
Inject the dose
A.
Use the injection method as instructed by your health care professional.
466 B.
Insert the needle into the skin.
C.
Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way.
A clicking sound can be heard, which will stop when the injection button has been pressed in completely.
D.
Keep the injection button pressed in and slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin.
This ensures that the full dose will be delivered.
Step 7.
Remove and discard the needle
Always remove the needle after each injection and store OptiSet without a needle attached.
This helps prevent: • Contamination and/ or infection • Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.
A.
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen.
To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap.
• If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing the needle.
Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e. g. a one handed capping technique) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.
B.
Dispose of the needle safely, as instructed by your healthcare professional.
C.
Put the pen cap back on, then store the pen until your next injection.
Storage Instructions
Please check section 5 – How to store Insuman Rapid - of the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for OptiSet storage instructions.
If your OptiSet is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up to room temperature.
Cold insulin is more painful to inject.
Discard your used OptiSet as required by your local regulations.
467 Maintenance
Protect your OptiSet from dust and dirt.
You can clean the outside of your OptiSet by wiping it with a damp cloth.
Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it.

Further information
1.
WHAT INSUMAN RAPID IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Insuman Rapid is a solution for injection under the skin or, in exceptional circumst ances, into a vein (blood vessel).
The insulin contained in Insuman Rapid is made by a biotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin.
Insuman Rapid is an insulin preparation with a rapid onset and short duration of action.
It comes in a cartridge sealed in a plastic container, which is the disposable part of OptiClik, an insulin pen.
This cartridge is for use with OptiClik only.
Insuman Rapid is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.
Insuman Rapid may also be used for treating severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build- up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar) as well as for controlling blood sugar before, during and after surgery.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE INSUMAN RAPID
Do not use Insuman Rapid
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin or any of the other ingredients of Insuman Rapid.
Do not use Insuman Rapid in insulin pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices.
Also do not use it in peristaltic pumps with silicone tubing.
Take special care with Insuman Rapid
Follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.
470 Special patient groups
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.
Travel
Before travelling, consult your doctor.
You may need to talk about
- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,

- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.
Illnesses and injuries
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:
- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).
In most cases you will need a doctor.
Make sure that you contact a doctor early.
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates.
Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin.
Using other medicines
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation).
In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high.
Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:
- all other medicines to treat diabetes,
- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood
pressure),
- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),
- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),
- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),
- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- sulfonamide antibiotics.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:
- corticosteroids (such as"cortisone", used to treat inflammation),
- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
471
- somatropin (growth hormone),
- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to
treat asthma),
- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
- atypical antipsychotic medications (such as olanzapine and clozapine).
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:
- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Using Insuman Rapid with food and drink
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant.
Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth.
Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Rapid in pregnant women.
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet.
Driving and using machines
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:
- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels),
- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels),
- you have problems with your sight.
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or operating machinery).
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:
- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Rapid
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium- free’.
472 3.
HOW TO USE INSUMAN RAPID
Dosage
Based on your life -style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will
- determine how much Insuman Rapid per day you will need,
- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Rapid.
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level.
You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low.
See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.
Frequency of administration
Insuman Rapid is injected under the skin 15 to 20 minutes before a meal.
Method of administration
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin.
With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.
Insulin administration into a vein for example to treat severe hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis, requires experience and special safety precautions.
For these reasons, it must be done in a clinic or a similar setting.
How to handle the cartridges for OptiClik
Insuman Rapid in cartridges for OptiClik has been developed for use with OptiClik only.
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, attaching the injection needle, and administering the insulin injection.
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it into the pen.
Look at the cartridge before you use it.
Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid particles visible, and has a water-like consistency.
Special care before injection
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen).
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.
- Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges.
- Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge.
- Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.
Problems with OptiClik?
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen.
If OptiClik is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be discarded, and a new OptiClik has to be used.
If OptiClik does not function well, you can draw the insulin from the cartridge into an injection syringe.
Therefore, keep injection syringes and needles as well.
However, use only those injection syringes which are designed for an insulin concentration of 100 IU (International Units) per ml.
473 Mistakes in dosage
If you use more Insuman Rapid than you should
- If you have injected too much Insuman Rapid, your blood sugar level may become too low
(hypoglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar.
For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
If you forget to use Insuman Rapid
- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Rapid or if you have not injected enough insulin, your
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using Insuman Rapid This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).
Do not stop Insuman Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Insuman Rapid can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
As with all insulin therapy, the most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.
Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening.
Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
Side effects reported commonly (Seen in less than 1 in 10 but more than 1 in 100 patients) • Oedema Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles. • Injection site reactions
Side effects reported uncommonly (Seen in less than 1 in 100 but more than 1 in 1000 patients) • Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) • Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)
Other side effects include • Systemic allergic reactions Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
474 • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.
Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well.
Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. • Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur.
They can also spread around the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin).
However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects.
To prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a side effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets worse rapidly.
5.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for
example through incorrect storage,
- your insulin pen does not work properly,
- you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you
have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
477 Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur.
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you inject too much insulin,
- you miss meals or delay them,
- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances
similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other
medicines").
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:
- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to ano ther insulin preparation,
- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia
- In your body
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.
- In your brain
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia (“warning symptoms”) may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if
478
- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem.
Be familiar with your warning symptoms.
If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked.
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia
1.
Do not inject insulin.
Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage.
Caution:
Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.
2.
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta).
Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
3.
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4.
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar).
These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.

If you stop using Insuman Rapid This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).
Do not stop Insuman Rapid without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Insuman Rapid can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
As with all insulin therapy, the most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.
Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening.
Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
Side effects reported commonly (Seen in less than 1 in 10 but more than 1 in 100 patients) • Oedema Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles. • Injection site reactions
Side effects reported uncommonly (Seen in less than 1 in 100 but more than 1 in 1000 patients) • Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) • Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)
Other side effects include • Systemic allergic reactions Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy)
484 If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.
Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well.
Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. • Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur.
They can also spread around the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin).
However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects.
To prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a side effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets worse rapidly.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for
example through incorrect storage,
- your insulin pen does not work properly,
- you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you
have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur.
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
487
- you inject too much insulin,
- you miss meals or delay them,
- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances
similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other
medicines").
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:
- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to ano ther insulin preparation,
- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia
- In your body
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.
- In your brain
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self -control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if
- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem.
Be familiar with your warning symptoms.
If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked.
If you are not confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia.
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia
1.
Do not inject insulin.
Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a sugar-sweetened beverage.
Caution:
Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners (such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia.
2.
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or pasta).
Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.
3.
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar.
4.
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs.
488 Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following:
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar).
These injections are justified even if it is not certain that you have hypoglycaemia.
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have hypoglycaemia.
489 Insuman Rapid solution for injection in a pre-filled pen.
SoloStar.
Instructions for Use.
SoloStar is a prefilled pen for the injection of insulin.
Your healthcare professional has decided that SoloStar is right for you.
Talk with your healthcare professional about proper injection technique before using SoloStar.
Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar.
If you are not able to follow all the instructions completely on your own, use SoloStar only if you have help from a person who is able to follow the instructions.
Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet.
To ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below.
Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an accurate dose.
If you do not follow these instructions completely, you may get too much or too little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose.
You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit.
Each pen contains multiple doses.
Keep this leaflet for future reference.
If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your healthcare professional or call the local sanofi-aventis number on the front of this leaflet.
Schematic diagram of the pen
Important information for use of SoloStar:
• Always attach a new needle before each use.
Only use needles that have been approved for use with SoloStar. • Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). • This pen is only for your use.
Do not share it with anyone else. • If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. • Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. • Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged.
Step 1.
Check the insulin
A.
Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin.
Insuman SoloStar is white with a colour on the injection button.
The injection button colour will vary based on the formulation of Insuman insulin used.
The pictures below are for illustrative purposes only.
B.
Take off the pen cap.
490 C.
Check the appearance of your insulin.
•
If you are using clear insulin (Insuman Rapid), do not use this pen if the insulin is cloudy, coloured or has particles.
•
If you are using a suspension insulin (Insuman Basal or Insuman mixtures), turn the pen up and down at least 10 times to resuspend the insulin.
Turn the pen gently to avoid foaming in the cartridge.
After mixing check the appearance of your insulin.
Insulin suspensions must have an evenly milky-white appearance.
Step 2.
Attach the needle
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection.
This helps prevent contamination, and potential needle blocks.
Before use of needle, carefully read the “Instructions for Use” accompanying the needles.
Please note:
The needles shown are for illustrative purposes only.
A.
Remove the protective seal from a new needle.
B.
Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type).
.
•
If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or break the needle.
Step 3.
Perform a safety test
Always perform the safety test before each injection.
This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: • ensuring that pen and needle work properly • removing air bubbles
491 A.
Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector.
B.
Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection.
Take off the inner needle cap and discard it.
C.
Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards.
D.
Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle.
E.
Press the injection button all the way in.
Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip.
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen.
• If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them. • If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked.
Change the needle and try again. • If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged.
Do not use this SoloStar.
Step 4.
Select the dose
You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units.
If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections.
A.
Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test.
B.
Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units).
If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down.
492 • Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out.
• You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen.
Do not force the dosage selector to turn.
In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose.
Step 5.
Inject the dose
A.
Use the injection method as instructed by your healthcare professional.
B.
Insert the needle into the skin.
C.
Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way.
The number in the dose window will return to “0” as you inject.
D.
Keep the injection button pressed all the way in.
Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin.
This ensures that the full dose will be delivered.
The pen plunger moves with each dose.
The plunger will reach the end of the cartridge when the total of 300 units of insulin have been used.
Step 6.
Remove and discard the needle
Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached.
This helps prevent: • Contamination and/or infection • Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing.
A.
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen.
To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap.
• If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle.
Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g. contact your healthcare professional) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases.
B.
Dispose of the needle safely.
C.
Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection.
493 Storage Instructions
Please check the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar.
If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up.
Cold insulin is more painful to inject.
Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities.
Maintenance
Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt.
You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth.
Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it.
Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely.
It should be handled with care.
Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged.
If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one.

Further information
1.
WHAT INSUMAN BASAL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Insuman Basal is a fluid (suspension) for injection under the skin.
The insulin contained in Insuman Basal is made by a biotechnology process and is identical with the body's own insulin.
Insuman Basal is an insulin preparation with a gradual onset and long duration of action.
The insulin is present as tiny crystals of insulin protamine.
Insuman Basal is used to reduce high blood sugar in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE INSUMAN BASAL
Do not use Insuman Basal
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to insulin or any of the other ingredients of Insuman Basal.
Do not inject Insuman Basal into a vein (blood vessel).
Do not use it in insulin pumps or other infusion pumps - special insulin preparations are available for use in such devices.
Take special care with Insuman Basal
Follow closely the instructions for dosage, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor.
Special patient groups
If you have liver or kidneys problems or if you are elderly, speak to your doctor as you may need a lower dose.
495 Travel
Before travelling, consult your doctor.
You may need to talk about
- the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,
- supplies of insulin, injection syringes etc.,
- correct storage of your insulin while travelling,
- timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,
- the possible effects of changing to different time zones,
- possible new health risks in the countries to be visited,
- what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill.
Illnesses and injuries
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care:
- If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia).
- If you are not eating enough, your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).
In most cases you will need a doctor.
Make sure that you contact a doctor early.
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue to get enough carbohydrates.
Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you require insulin.
Using other medicines
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the situation).
In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dosage to avoid blood sugar levels that are either too low or too high.
Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level, and what action, if any, you need to take.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include:
- all other medicines to treat diabetes,
- angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high blood
pressure),
- disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions),
- fluoxetine (used to treat depression),
- fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids),
- monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression),
- pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as aspirin, used to relieve pain and lower fever),
- sulfonamide antibiotics.
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include:
- corticosteroids (such as "cortisone", used to treat inflammation),
- danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),
- diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),
- diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),
- glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),
- isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),
- oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),
- phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),
- somatropin (growth hormone),
- sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline] or salbutamol, terbutaline used to
treat asthma),
- thyroid hormones (used to treat the thyroid gland disorders),
- protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV),
496
- atypical antipsychotic medications (such as olanzapine and clozapine).
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take:
- beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),
- clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),
- lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia.
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia.
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Using Insuman Basal with food and drink
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant.
Your insulin dosage may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth.
Particularly careful control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.
However, there is no experience with the use of Insuman Basal in pregnant women.
If you are breast -feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and your diet.
Driving and using machines
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if:
- you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels),
- you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels),
- you have problems with your sight.
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (such as driving a car or operating machinery).
You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if:
- you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia,
- the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Insuman Basal
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium - free’.
3.
HOW TO USE INSUMAN BASAL
Dosage
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests, your doctor will
- determine how much Insuman Basal per day you will need,
- tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,
- tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Insuman Basal.
497 Many factors may influence your blood sugar level.
You should know these factors so that you are able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or too low.
See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information.
Frequency of administration
Insuman Basal is injected under the skin 45 to 60 minutes before a meal.
Method of administration
Do NOT inject Insuman Basal into a vein.
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject your insulin.
With each injection, change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.
How to handle the vials
Insuman Basal contains 100 IU insulin per ml.
Only injection syringes designed for this insulin concentration (100 IU per ml) must be used.
The injection syringes must not contain any other medicines or traces of medicines (such as traces of heparin).
Before the first withdrawal of insulin you must remove the safety tear-off lid on the vial.
Mix the insulin well immediately before each injection.
This is best done by rolling the vial tilted between the palms of the hands.
Do not shake the vial vigorously as this could damage the insulin and cause froth to form.
Froth can make it difficult for you to measure the correct dose.
After mixing, the suspension must have a uniform milky white appearance.
It must not be used if it remains clear or if, for example, clumps, flakes, particles or anything similar are in the suspension or on the sides or bottom of the vial.
A new vial with a uniform suspension on mixing must then be used.
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse.
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness.
If you think you may have a problem with your insulin, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist.
Special care before injection
Before injection remove any air bubbles.
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.
Do not mix insulin with any other medicines.
Insuman Basal may be mixed with all Sanofi-Aventis human insulin preparations, EXCEPT those specially designed for use in insulin pumps.
Also, it must NOT be mixed with animal source insulins or insulin analogues.
Your doctor will tell you if you have to mix Sanofi-Aventis human insulins.
If you need to inject a mixture, draw the other insulin into the injection syringe before Insuman Basal.
Inject as soon as you have mixed them.
Do not mix insulins of different strengths (for example 100 IU per ml and 40 IU per ml).
Mistakes in dosage
If you use more Insuman Basal than you should
- If you have injected too much Insuman Basal, your blood sugar level may become too low
(hypoglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar.
For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
If you forget to use Insuman Basal
498
- If you have missed a dose of Insuman Basal or if you have not injected enough insulin, your
blood sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia).
Check your blood sugar frequently.
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop using Insuman Basal This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar).
Do not stop Insuman Basal without speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Insuman Basal can cause side effects, although not eveybody gets them.
As with all insulin therapy, the most frequent side effect is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening.
For further information on the side effects of low blood sugar or high blood sugar, see the box at the end of this leaflet.
Severe allergic reactions to insulin may occur which may become life-threatening.
Such reactions to insulin or to the excipients can cause large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating.
Side effects reported commonly (Seen in less than 1 in 10 but more than 1 in 100 patients) • Oedema Insulin treatment may cause temporary build-up of water in the body with swelling in the calves and ankles. • Injection site reactions
Side effects reported uncommonly (Seen in less than 1 in 100 but more than 1 in 1000 patients) • Severe allergic reaction with low blood pressure (shock) • Injection site urticaria (itchy rash)
Other side effects include • Systemic allergic reactions Associated symptoms may include large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and sweating. • Eye reactions A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision temporarily.
If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. • Skin changes at the injection site (lipodystrophy) If you inject your insulin too often at the same skin site, fatty tissue under the skin at this site may either shrink or thicken.
Insulin that you inject in such a site may not work very well.
Changing the injection site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes. • Skin and allergic reactions Other mild reactions at the injection site (such as injection site redness, unusually intense pain on injection site, itching, injection site swelling or injection site inflammation) may occur.
They can also spread around the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulins usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against insulin).
However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dosage.
499 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the side effects listed above or any other unwanted or unexpected effects.
To prevent serious reactions, speak to a doctor immediately if a side effect is severe, occurs suddenly or gets worse rapidly.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you.
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic.
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin.
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for
example through incorrect storage,
- you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or you
have an injury, operation, infection or fever,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
Stomach pain, fast and deep breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) resulting from lack of insulin.
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms occur.
Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a hospital.
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels)
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious.
Serious hypoglycaemia may cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life -threatening.
You normally should be able to recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.
502 Why does hypoglycaemia occur?
Examples include:
- you inject too much insulin,
- you miss meals or delay them,
- you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and substances
similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT carbohydrates),
- you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea,
- you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much,
- you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity,
- you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress,
- you are recovering from an illness or from fever,
- you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other
medicines").
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if:
- you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation,
- your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable,
- you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper arm),
- you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism.
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia
- In your body
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular heartbeat.
These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.
- In your brain
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self -control, inability to look after yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness.
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker or may be missing altogether if
- you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy),
- you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly,
- you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,
- you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Insuman,
- you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Using other medicines").
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the problem.
Be familiar with your warning symptoms.
If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked.
