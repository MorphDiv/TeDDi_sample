You have no moves to undo.
There are no moves to redo. That could be because you have not undone any or you have redone them all or because all previously undone moves are automatically deleted whenever you make a new move using the keyboard or mouse.
The cube has animated moves in progress or the demo is running. Please wait or click on the cube to stop the demo.
Sorry, too busy.

% of bevel on edges of cubies:
You can choose any size of cube (or brick) up to 6x6x6, but only one side can have dimension 1 (otherwise the puzzle becomes trivial). The easiest puzzle is 2x2x1 and 3x3x1 is a good warmup for the original Rubik's Cube, which is 3x3x3. Simple puzzles have 2 to 5 shuffling moves, a difficult 3x3x3 puzzle has 10 to 20 --- or you can choose zero shuffling then shuffle the cube yourself, maybe for a friend to solve. The other options determine whether you can watch the shuffling and/ or your own moves and how fast the animation goes. The bevel option affects the appearance of the small cubes. Try setting it to 30 and you'll see what we mean.

Rubik's Cube can be moved into many interesting patterns. Here are a few from David Singmaster's classic book'Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube, Fifth Edition ', pages 47-49, published in 1981. After a pattern has formed, you can use the Solve action (default key S) to undo and redo it as often as you like.

Mathematicians calculate that a 3x3x3 cube can be shuffled into 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different patterns, yet they conjecture that all positions can be solved in 20 moves or less. The method that can do that (as yet undiscovered) is called God's Algorithm. Many longer methods are known. See the two Wikipedia articles on Rubik's Cube and Optimal Solutions for Rubik's Cube. Several methods work systematically by building the solution one layer at a time, using sequences of moves that solve a few pieces without disturbing what has already been done. The'Beginner Solution 'demonstrated here uses that approach. Just over 100 moves solve a cube that is shuffled in 20.

Run a demonstration of puzzle moves, in which randomly chosen cubes, bricks or mats are shuffled and solved.
Realign Cube
Realign the cube so that the top, front and right faces are visible together.
Realign the cube so that the top, front and right faces are visible together and the cube's axes are parallel to the XYZ axes, thus making keyboard moves properly meaningful.
Singmaster Moves
This area shows Singmaster moves.
This area shows Singmaster moves. They are based on the letters RLFBUD, representing (in English) the Right, Left, Front, Back, Up and Down faces. In normal view, the letters RFU represent clockwise moves of the three visible faces and LBD appear as anticlockwise moves of the hidden faces. Adding a '(apostrophe) to a letter gives the reverse of that letter's move. To move inner slices, add periods (or dots) before the letter of the nearest face.
