Connection Lost.
Kopete lost the channel used to talk to the instant messaging system. This can be because either your internet access went down, the service is experiencing problems, or the service disconnected you because you tried to connect with the same account from another location. Try connecting again later.
Cannot connect with the instant messaging server or peers.
Cannot connect.

More Information...
