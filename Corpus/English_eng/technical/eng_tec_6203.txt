& konqueror; the File Manager
Folders and Paths
In & UNIX; and & Linux; all folders are arranged in a simple hierarchy. Starting from a top level folder (also called the root directory), the structure descends and branches containing various files and subfolders. This means that you can get from any folder to any other by going up until you reach a common point then down through the appropriate subfolders until you reach your target.
The position of any file or folder in the structure (also called a directory tree) can be described by its path, which is a simple list of the folders you would have to descend through to get to the target folder or file. For example / home/ pam is the subfolder pam of the subfolder home of the top level folder, and / home/ pam/ words. txt is the file words. txt in that subfolder. The leading / in these paths represents the top level folder.
Every folder accessible by your system & mdash; including those on other hard disk partitions, your floppy and & CD-ROM; & mdash; will appear in the tree descending from /, their exact paths will depend on how your system was set up (see also the section on Floppy and & CD-ROM; Drives).
Every user on a & UNIX; / & Linux; system has their own home folder to hold their personal files and settings; for example / home/ john and / home/ mary. The symbol ~ is often used to represent the user's home folder, so that ~/ letter. txt refers to the file letter. txt in my home folder.
Note that the term directory is often used instead of folder.
View Modes
In File Manager mode, & konqueror; lists which files and subfolders are contained within a given folder and can provide you with some information about them. The path of the current folder is shown in the Location Toolbar. The way that & konqueror; displays the files and folders depends mainly on your choice of view mode which can be selected from the View View Mode sub menu. The view modes & konqueror; provides are outlined below.
Icon View
Displays an icon and a name for each file or subfolder in the current folder.
Files of certain types may display a preview of their contents instead of the default icon. The file types selected for preview are controlled by the View Preview sub menu settings. See the section File Previews of this handbook for more details.
MultiColumn View
Is similar to Icon View except that the current folder contents are organized into columns instead of rows. Files may be previewed in MultiColumn View as they are in Icon View.
Tree View
Can be used to navigate the folder tree starting at the current folder. Each file and subfolder is shown on its own line. Folders can be expanded to reveal their contents by left clicking on the preceding + sign. Similarly, an expanded folder's contents can be hidden by left clicking on the - sign.
In addition to the file name, some file detail information is shown on each line. The details are controlled by the View Show Details sub menu settings.
Info List View
Displays each file on a separate line similar to the Detailed List View except that the detail information is specific to the file type. This feature is controlled by the View View As sub menu.
For example: If the file type is Folder, then the contents information is shown. Viewing as JPEG Images shows the pixel dimensions and EXIF data if available, and viewing as Plain Text shows the lines, words, characters, and format.
Detailed List View
Displays each file or folder on a separate line, as an icon followed by the file or folder name followed by information about the item. The amount of information shown is controlled by the View Show Details sub menu settings.
Text View
Is similar to the Detailed List View except that icons are not shown and the first character in each line will be / if the item is a folder.
Photobook
Transforms & konqueror; into a simple viewing application for the current folder. Most of the main window renders a selected image, and thumbnails of the image files in the current directory are previewed along the side.
File Size View
Creates a visual representation of the folder tree that reflects the file sizes of the folder contents. The window area represents all of the disk space used by the contents of the current folder. Subfolders and their contents are represented as rectangular blocks. The area of each block is proportional to the size of its contents. Various modifications to this visualization are controlled via the sub menus of the View menu.
File Tip Info
Checking the Show file tips box in the Behavior page of the & konqueror; Configuration dialog causes a small pop up information window to appear when the mouse pointer is hovered over a file or folder name or icon.
If the Show previews in file tips checkbox is checked the pop up window will also show a small image of the file contents.
File Previews
Selecting View Preview from the Menubar will bring up a sub menu that lets you enable file previews for certain types of file.
Generally this means that the file's icon will be replaced by a small image showing the file contents.
If file preview is enabled for Sound Files the file will be played whenever the mouse cursor is hovering over the file name or icon.
Note that file previews are only available in Icon View and MultiColumn View modes.
Because & konqueror; has to read much more data than just the file name details to generate a preview, file previews may not be appropriate when viewing files on a floppy or from a remote system. The Previews page of the File Manager Configuration dialog allows you to disable file previews for protocols such as ftp where reading the extra data would take too long.
Navigation
To get to a file with & konqueror; you first need to navigate through the folder tree to find the folder containing that file.
To move between folders you can simply step up and down the tree:
To descend into a subfolder left click on its name or icon -- or if you have already selected it (see below) -- then just press Enter.
To go up the folder tree you can click on the Up button in the Toolbar, use Alt; Up Arrow, or use the Menubar Go Up option.
To select a file or folder in the displayed folder without opening it in any way use the up and down arrow keys to move through the items. The selected item will be highlighted and some information about it will be displayed in the Status Bar.
Setting the View Mode to Tree View can help you locate folders in the tree below the current folder; in this mode each folder is shown with a small box at the left. If the box contains a + sign, left clicking on the box (not on the folder name or icon) will display a sub tree showing files and subfolders contained in that folder. The small box will then change to show a - sign. Left click on that to collapse the sub tree. Once you have found the folder you are looking for, left click on the folder name or icon to open it.
The Navigation Panel can also help you find your way around the file system.
You can go directly to any folder by typing its path into the Location Toolbar window or into the dialog box invoked by the Menubar Location Open Location item or by Ctrl; O. & konqueror; 's Text Completion feature may be useful when you do this. Do n't forget that in & Linux; / & UNIX; file and folder names are case sensitive.
When you have moved to a new folder you can go back to your previous choice by using the Toolbar Back button, the Menubar Go Back item, or Alt; Left Arrow. Once you have gone back you can go forward. Use the Toolbar Forward button, the Menubar Go Forward item or Alt; Right Arrow.
Alternatively, you can also choose to enter the parent folder by clicking on the Toolbar Up, the Go Up item, or with Alt; Up Arrow.
Holding the & LMB; pressed while the mouse pointer is over the Toolbar Up, Back or Forward buttons brings up a menu of recently visited locations.
Finding Files and Folders
If you do n't know or ca n't remember where a file or folder is within your system, then use the Toolbar Find File button or the Menubar Tools Find File... option. This will embed the file finder application & kfind; into & konqueror; 's window. See the & kfind; Handbook for help in using & kfind;.
If the name of a file or folder begins with a period (dot), then it is a hidden file or folder, and will not normally be shown by & konqueror;. To see hidden files or folders use the Menubar View Show Hidden Files option.
Another reason & konqueror; may not show the file or folder you are looking for is that you may have the View Filter plugin set to display only certain types of file.
Floppy and & CD-ROM; Drives
Any floppy disk, & CD; drive or other hard disk partition that you have on your system will usually appear in the /, / media, / mnt or / auto folder, having a path something like / mnt/ floppy or / cdrom. The details will depend on how your system was set up.
& UNIX; / & Linux; requires that you mount a floppy disk or & CD-ROM; when you have inserted it into the drive, and mount other hard disk partitions when you want to access them. You also need to unmount a floppy disk or & CD-ROM; before removing it to register that it is no longer available.
How you do this will depend on how your system:
You may have an Automount facility, in which case you do n't have to bother about explicitly mounting and unmounting, although you may find that the & CD-ROM; occasionally starts up by itself for no apparent reason.
You may have Floppy, & CD-ROM; and hard disk icons on your desktop, in which case & LMB; click on the icon to mount it. Doing this should also bring up a & konqueror; window showing the contents of the floppy, & CD-ROM; or partition. To unmount, right click on the icon and choose the Unmount item. Visit the section Create New... in this Handbook to see how to create such an icon.
Or you can do it the traditional way by typing into a text console window:
mount / mnt/ floppy
to mount, for example, the floppy drive, and
umount / mnt/ floppy
to unmount it (umount not unmount).
Rather than having to open a text console to type the mount or umount commands, you may prefer to use & konqueror; 's Tools Execute Shell Command (Ctrl; E) feature.
Deleting Files and Folders
& konqueror; gives you two ways to dispose of an unwanted file or folder:
You can move it to the Trash folder, which is the safest method as you can get it back if you realize that you have made a mistake.
You can just plain Delete it, which removes the entry from the folder and adds the disk area occupied by the file(s) to the system's list of free disk areas, in the same way as the rm command.
The simplest way to remove a file or folder is to position the mouse pointer over its name or icon and press the & RMB;, which will bring up a menu containing the options Move to Trash and Delete.
Or, if you have selected the item, the Menubar Edit menu will give you the choice of Move to Trash and Delete options.
Del will move the selected item or items to Trash.
Shift; Del will really, truly and irrevocably delete the selected item or items.
You wo n't be able to remove a file or folder if you do n't have the necessary permissions; see the section on Super User Mode for further details.
Moving and Copying
To copy a file or subfolder between folders you can:
Position the mouse pointer over its name or icon and hold down the & RMB;, which will bring up a menu containing the Copy option. Choose that.
Or if the item is selected you can use the Copy button on the Toolbar or the Menubar Edit Copy item, or the Ctrl; C shortcut key combination. You can also select multiple files or folders to copy/ move as well.
Navigate to the folder you want to copy the item into then Paste the item into the new folder by using the Toolbar Paste button or the Menubar Edit Paste option or the Ctrl; V shortcut, or by moving the mouse pointer to a clear area of the window and holding the & RMB; down to bring up a menu containing the Paste option.
Moving a file or subfolder between folders can be done in the same way as copying, except that you choose the Cut option or Ctrl; X instead of Copy. The item that you have Cut will be removed from the original folder when you do the Paste into the new folder.
You can also copy or move selected item(s) to another folder by using Edit Copy Files (F7) or Edit Move Files (F8), or by selecting Copy To or Move To from the drop down menu you get when you right click on an file or folder name in the File Manager window.
You may not be able to copy or move a file or folder if you do n't have the necessary permissions. See the section on Super User Mode for further details.
Using Drag'n Drop
& konqueror; also supports Drag and Drop copying and moving of files and folders.
You can do this by having two instances of & konqueror;, one showing the folder you want to copy from, the other showing the target folder. Position the mouse pointer over the item you wish to copy or move, then, holding the & LMB; pressed, drag it to a clear space in the target folder. Release the button and you will be presented with a menu choice of Copy or Move. Take care to drop the item into an empty area of the target folder view - dropping it on top of another file name or icon can cause problems.
You can also set up & konqueror; to show more than one folder within its window and drag & drop between them.
Split Views for Drag & Drop
This screenshot illustrates the use of the Menubar Window Split View Left/ Right option, also available with the shortcut Ctrl; Shift; L, to split the main & konqueror; window into two views, each showing the contents of a different folder.
To be able to show different folders in each view they should not be linked; the little boxes at the bottom right of each view should be empty.
The active view, that is the one whose path is shown in the Location Toolbar and which responds to navigation and Menubar commands, is shown by the little green light in the bottom left corner. To make a view active, left click on an empty area of the view or on its Status Bar.
To remove an active view from & konqueror; 's window use the Ctrl; Shift; R shortcut, or the Menubar Window Remove Active View option, or & RMB; click on the Status Bar and choose the Remove Active View option from the resulting menu.
If you use & konqueror; tabs, you can drag and drop between tabs by dragging the file to the tab label, without letting go yet. The destination tab will pop to the front, allowing you to continue dragging and then drop the file.
Duplicate File Names
If you try to paste a file into a folder that already contains a file with the same name, & konqueror; will pop up a dialog box warning you that the file already exists. You can then choose to:
Overwrite the old file with the newly copied one. The Overwrite All button can be used if you have copied multiple items.
Cancel the paste operation by pressing the Skip or Skip All button.
Give the file that is being copied a different name. You can do this by typing a new name into the text entry box or get & konqueror; to Propose one. When you have done this press the Rename button.
Selecting Multiple Files
You sometimes want to delete, copy or move a number of files that are similar in some way. For example you may wish to move all of the. png graphics files from one folder to another. & konqueror; makes this easy by letting you select multiple files based on similarities in their file names.
Use the Menubar Edit Selection Select... item or the shortcut Ctrl; +. This brings up a little dialog box in which you enter a filename containing the wildcard characters *, which matches any number of characters, and? which matches a single character. Press OK and & konqueror; will highlight all files with matching names. For example;
flag*. png will select all filenames starting with the letters flag and ending with. png.
memo?. txt will select memo1. txt and memo9. txt but not memo99. txt.
When you have selected a range of files, you can narrow down the selection by using the Menubar Edit Unselect... option or Ctrl; - to specify which of the selected files should be removed from the selection.
Use Ctrl; U or the Menubar Edit Unselect All option or just & LMB; click on a clear area of the view to cancel the selection.
You can even invert the selection: that is, deselect all selected files and select those that were previously unselected. Use the Menubar Edit Invert Selection option or Ctrl; * to do this.
You can also select multiple files and folders by holding the Ctrl; button while you click on each individual file or folder. This enables you to then move or copy multiple files and folders to a different location at one time by using the same method above.
A number of useful shortcut keys can be used in list, tree and text view modes:
Space
Toggle the current selection.
Insert
Toggle the current selection and move down to the next item.
Ctrl; Up Arrow, Ctrl; Down Arrow, Ctrl; Home, Ctrl; End, Ctrl; Page Up, Ctrl; Page Down
Move the selection, toggling the selection of everything on the way.
Shift; Up Arrow, Shift; Down Arrow, Shift; Home, Shift; End, Shift; Page Up, Shift; Page Down
Deselect everything, then move the selection, selecting everything on the way.
Once you have selected the right files then the normal delete, copy or move commands will act on all of the selected files at once.
Depending on your keyboard type and locale, you may find that the Ctrl; +, Ctrl; - and Ctrl; * shortcuts only work with the Numeric keypad +, - and * keys.
Create New
When & konqueror; is in File Manager mode, picking Create New from the Edit menu or from the context menu you get by & RMB; clicking on a free area in a folder view gives you a submenu letting you create any of the following in the current folder:
File Link To Application...
This option is most useful if you want to create an icon that will open a particular application. It opens a dialog box with three tabbed pages. The first, General, is where you choose an icon and the text that will appear with it. The second page, Permissions, lets you select who can use or modify the icon. In the Application page you must enter the Command that will run the application, for example, kedit to start up the & kedit; text editor. kedit / home/ pam/ todo. txt would open the file / home/ pam/ todo. txt in & kedit;. Advanced options such as the file types which the application can open are also available from this page.
To make the application icon appear on your desktop, create the link in your ~/ Desktop folder (this may be called something slightly different depending on how & kde; was installed on your system) or get to the Create New... sub menu by right clicking on a free area of the desktop instead of within & konqueror; 's window.
If you have a lot of specialized application links and do n't want to clutter up the desktop, then why not create them in your Applications folder. You can get there in & konqueror; by choosing Go Applications. Then create a single icon on your desktop to open your Applications folder, which is usually in ~/. kde/ share/ applnk.
To put an application link icon into the panel, first create it in the Applications folder then drag the icon onto a clear area of the panel.
File Link To Location (URL)...
This lets you create an icon to open & konqueror; at a particular folder or web page. As with Link To Application... you can make the application icon appear on your desktop by creating the link in your ~/ Desktop folder or going to the Create New... sub menu by right clicking on a free area of the desktop. When you first create it the text shown with the icon will be the full path or & URL;. You can change it by right clicking on the icon, selecting Properties... and entering the preferred text in the General tab page.
Device Floppy Device...
Use this option to create an icon that will mount a floppy disk and open an instance of & konqueror; showing the disk's contents. To unmount the disk when you have finished with it right click on the icon and select Unmount. In practice it does n't have to be a floppy disk but can be any hard disk or partition on your system that is not normally mounted. However, in most cases you will want to create the icon on your desktop.
Device Hard Disk...
This option is similar to Floppy Device... but for a hard disk drive or partition.
CD/ DVD-ROM Device...
This option is similar to Floppy Device... but for a CD or DVD drive.
Folder...
An easy way of creating a new (sub)folder.
Text File...
Use this to create an ordinary, empty, text file. A dialog box will be opened for you to enter the name of your new file.
HTML File...
Creates a skeleton HTML source file. When you type the new file's name into the dialog box it is probably best to give it a. html extension to avoid confusion.
Presentation Document...
Creates a skeleton & koffice; & kpresenter; document. Give its name a. kpr extension.
Text Document...
Creates a skeleton KOffice & kword; document using the standard & kword; style template. Give its name a. kwd extension.
Spread Sheet Document...
Use this to create a new KOffice & kspread; spreadsheet file, and name it with a. ksp extension.
Illustration Document...
Creates a new KOffice & kontour; document. Name it with the extension. kil.
Changing Names and Permissions
The two easiest ways to change the name of a file or folder is to either right click on it and select Rename, or select the file or folder and then press the F2 button.
To change the name or permissions of a file or folder right click on its name or icon and select the Properties... item, or if you have selected the file or folder, then you can use the Menubar Edit Properties option.
This will bring up the Properties dialog box with two tabbed pages:
General, which gives you some information about the item and lets you change its name and, for a folder, the associated icon.
Permissions, which shows you the item's ownership and access permissions and lets you change the permissions.
Copy and Rename
If you want to make a copy of an existing file with a different name -- perhaps as a backup -- in the same folder as the original file, do a normal Copy then when you Paste it a dialog box will pop up complaining that the file already exists. Just type the new name into the dialog's text box and press the Rename button (or if you are feeling lazy pressing the Propose button will generate a new name for you).
Super User Mode
If you are running as a normal user and try to access files outside of your own home folder you will often be prevented from doing so and get an error message such as Access Denied.
To access these files you need to be logged in as the system administrator, often known as the Super User or root.
Rather than logging out then in again, you can launch & konqueror; from the K Menu in Super User mode by selecting System File Manager - Super User Mode. You will be asked for the root login password but as long as you can provide that & konqueror; will be started up with full access privileges to all files on your system.
Take care. As Super User (root), you have complete control of your system, and a wrong command can easily do irrevocable damage.
Also, connecting to the internet as root is an extremely bad idea, as it seriously increases your vulnerability to malicious hacking.
Configuring File Associations
& kde; provides many applications which can open many different types of file. Most of the time, the defaults will work with no problems, but & konqueror; provides a powerful system to allow you to change the applications used to open each file type. For more details, choose the Settings Configure Konqueror... menu item, select File Associations in the configuration dialog, and click on Help.
At the Command Line
Although & konqueror; is a very powerful and flexible GUI file manager, there are occasions when the experienced & Linux; / & UNIX; user wants to get down to the basics and work at the text command line level.
You can, of course, open an instance of & konsole;, perhaps with & konqueror; 's Menubar Tools Open Terminal option or with Ctrl; T.
If you only want to launch a program or view a & URL;, the Tools Run Command (Alt; F2) option may be easier.
Tools Execute Shell Command... (Ctrl; E) opens a small command line dialog window where you can enter a shell command such as ps -ax | grep kdeinit. Note that it does not support full featured terminal control characters, so applications such as top and less will not work properly, but it is available immediately without the delay involved in starting & konsole;.
For more complex operations, & konqueror; has another nice feature: the Menubar Settings Show Terminal Emulator option, which opens up a terminal window as a new view within & konqueror;. As long as the link icon is visible at the bottom right corner of each view, the terminal will follow any folder changes you make in the normal file manager view.
Including the terminal emulator
