Detective
This command activates the Spreadsheet Detective.
With the Detective, you can trace the dependencies from the current formula cell to the cells in the spreadsheet.
Once you have defined a trace, you can point with the mouse cursor to the trace.
The mouse cursor will change its shape.
Double-click the trace with this cursor to select the referenced cell at the end of the trace.
