Introduction
& kdiamond; is a single player puzzle game.
The object of the game is to build lines of three similar diamonds.
How to Play
The player is presented with a rectangular grid containing several types of diamonds. The object of the game is to swap neighbored diamonds to assemble a line of three similar diamonds. These lines will vanish and the board will be refilled with new diamonds. The game time is limited, try to build as much lines as possible to earn a high score.
Click on one diamond, then on one of its neighbors. The diamonds will then be swapped. (You may also click and drag a diamond upon one of its neighbors to invoke the swap.) If no line of at least three diamonds is formed by the swap, it will be reverted. The status bar displays the game time left, the number of points you have earned, and the number of possible moves.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Rules
When a line was removed and the diamonds fall down to fill gaps, it may be that then new lines are composed. Try to achieve such cascades when selecting a diamond pair as you will earn extra points: You get 1 point for the line you build, 2 points for the first cascade, 3 points for a possible next cascade, and so on.
Try to build lines with more than 3 diamonds: You will earn an extra second for each two extra diamonds removed.
The number of diamond types increases when choosing Hard difficulty levels, thus making it harder to build lines. In contrast, the board size will grow on the Easy difficulty levels to make it easier to find a move.
The game will stop once there are no possible moves left. Especially on Hard difficulty levels, you should keep this in mind when choosing your next move.
