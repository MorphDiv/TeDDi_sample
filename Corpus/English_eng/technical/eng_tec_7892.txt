%1 parses and validates the SGML document whose document entity is
specified by the system identifiers SYSID... and prints on the standard
output a simple text representation of its Element Structure Information Set.
If more than one system identifier is specified, then the corresponding

identifiers are specified, then %1 will read the document entity from
the standard input. A command line system identifier of - can be used
to refer to the standard input.
