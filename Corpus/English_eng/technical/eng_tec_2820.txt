PHP Manual

(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns an array of strings, each of which is a substring of string formed by splitting it on boundaries formed by the string separator.
If limit is set, the returned array will contain a maximum of limit elements with the last element containing the rest of string.
If separator is an empty string (""), explode() will return FALSE.
If separator contains a value that is not contained in string, then explode() will return an array containing string.
Note:
The limit parameter was added in PHP 4.0.1
Example 1. explode() examples
$pizza = "piece1 piece2 piece3 piece4 piece5 piece6"; $pieces = explode(" ", $pizza); $data = "foo:*:1023:1000:: / home / foo: / bin / sh"; list($user,$pass,$uid,$gid,$gecos,$home,$shell) = explode(" :",$data);
Note:
Although implode() can for historical reasons accept its parameters in either order, explode() cannot.
You must ensure that the separator argument comes before the string argument.
