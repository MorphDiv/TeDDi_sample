Introduction
What is & kde;?
& kde; is the K Desktop Environment. It is a project initiated by Matthias Ettrich in 1996. The aim of the & kde; project is to connect the power of the & UNIX; operating systems with the comfort of a modern user interface.
In short, & kde; will bring & UNIX; to the desktop!
If you want further information about & kde;, have a look at What is & kde;?
On which platforms can I expect & kde; to work?
& kde; is a Desktop Environment for all flavors of & UNIX;. While it is true that most & kde; developers use & Linux;, & kde; runs smoothly on a wide range of systems. You may, however, need to tweak the source code a bit to get & kde; to compile on a not-so-popular variant of & UNIX;, or if you are not using the & GNU; development tools, in particular the & gcc; compiler.
Is & kde; a window manager?
No, & kde; is not a window manager. While & kde; includes a very sophisticated window manager (kwin;), & kde; is much more than that. It is a full-blown Integrated Desktop Environment.
& kde; provides a complete desktop environment, including a web browser, a file manager, a window manager, a help system, a configuration system, uncountable tools and utilities, and an ever increasing number of applications, including but not limited to mail and news clients, drawing programs, a & PostScript; and a & DVI; viewer and so forth.
Is & kde; a CDE, & Windows; or & Mac; OS clone?
No, & kde; is not a clone. Specifically & kde; is not a CDE or & Windows; clone. While the & kde; developers have and will continue to glean the best features from all existing desktop environments, & kde; is a truly unique environment that has and will continue to go its own way.
Is & kde; free software?
Yes, & kde; is free software according to the & GNU; General Public License. All & kde; libraries are available under the LGPL making commercial software development for the & kde; desktop possible, but all & kde; applications are licensed under the GPL.
& kde; uses the Qt; C++ crossplatform toolkit, which is also released (since version 2.2) under the GPL and since version 4.5.0 also under the LGPL.
It is absolutely legal to make & kde; and & Qt; available on & CD-ROM; free of charge. No runtime fees of any kind are incurred.
