toolbar, with which you can add connectors to objects in the current slide.
A connector is a line that joins objects, and remains attached when the objects are moved.
If you copy an object with a connector, the connector is also copied.
There are four types of connector lines:
Standard (90-degree angle bends)
Line (two bends)
Straight
Curved
glue points
to an object.
To draw a connector line, click a glue point on an object, drag to a glue point on another object, and then release.
You can also drag to an empty part of you document and click.
The unattached end of the connector is locked in place, until you drag the end to a different location.
To detach a connector, drag either end of the connector line to a different location.
