When you select an object, its dimensions are displayed on the rulers as grey double lines.
To precisely resize the object, drag one of the double lines to a new location on the ruler.
When you select a text object on a slide, indents and tabs are displayed on the horizontal ruler.
To change the indent or tab settings for the text object, drag an indent or a tab stop marker to a new location on the ruler.
