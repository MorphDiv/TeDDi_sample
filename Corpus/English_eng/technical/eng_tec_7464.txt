Basic usage
The game window is divided into two boxes: the one on the right side of the window contains the pieces that needs to be arranged; the one on the left side of the window is where the pieces from the right box will be arranged and moved. Each piece is divided into four little triangles containing a number.
The scope of the game is to position the pieces so that only two identical numbers are next to each other.
It is not possible to position the pieces so that different number are next to each other.
The game is completed when you have positioned all the pieces in their right positions.

Simple tips on how to possibly win a game.
Win
The following tips will not assure you to win a game, they are intended as a simple aid.
Look for a single number
When you start a new game, look for a single number, or a number that has no similar numbers that can be placed next to it.
If you have one such number, that piece is a valid starting piece, since you know where it has to be placed.
Note that the bigger the size of the board, the harder is to find such a number.
