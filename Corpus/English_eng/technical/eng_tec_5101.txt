(PHP 4 = 4.0.2)
Returns a string with str wrapped at the column number specified by the (optional) width parameter.
The line is broken using the (optional) break parameter.
wordwrap() will automatically wrap at column 75 and break using '\n '(newline) if width or break are not given.
If the cut is set to 1, the string is always wrapped at the specified width.
So if you have a word that is larger than the given width, it is broken apart. (See second example).
Note:
The optional cut parameter was added in PHP 4.0.3
Example 1. wordwrap() example
$text = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog ."; $newtext = wordwrap ($text, 20); echo "$newtext\n";
This example would display:
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
Example 2. wordwrap() example
$text = "A very long woooooooooooord ."; $newtext = wordwrap ($text, 8, "\n", 1); echo "$newtext\n";
This example would display:
A very long wooooooo ooooord.
