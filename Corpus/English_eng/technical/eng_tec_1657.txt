Changing the Properties of Controls in the Dialogue Box Editor
You can set the properties of control that you add to a dialogue box.
For example, you can change the colour, name and size of a button that you added.
You can change most control properties when you create or edit a dialogue box.
However, you can only change some properties at run-time.
