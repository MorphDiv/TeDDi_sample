Changing Page Orientation
All page properties for Writer text documents, like for example the page orientation, are defined by page styles.
By default, a new text document uses the “Default” page style for all pages.
If you open an existing text document, different page styles may have been applied to the different pages.
It is important to know that changes that you apply to a page property will only affect the pages that use the current page style.
The current page style is listed in the Status Bar at the lower window border.
To Change the Page Orientation for All Pages
If your text document consists only of pages with the same page style, you can change the page properties directly:
Format - Page
.
Page
tab.
Paper format
, select “Portrait” or “Landscape”.
OK
.
To change the page orientation only for some pages
$[officename] uses page styles to specify the orientation of the pages in a document.
Page styles define more page properties, as for example header and footer or page margins.
You can either change the “Default” page style for the current document, or you can define own page styles and apply those page styles to any parts of your text.
To change the page orientation of one or more pages in a document from portrait to landscape in a document, you must first create a page style that uses the landscape orientation, and then apply the page style to the pages.
At the end of this help page, we'll discuss the scope of page styles in detail.
If you are unsure about the page style concept, please read the section at the end of this page.
Unlike character styles or paragraph styles, the page styles don't know a hierarchy.
You can create a new page style based on the properties of an existing page style, but when you later change the source style, the new page style does not automatically inherit the changes.
To change the page orientation for all pages that share the same page style, you first need a page style, then apply that style:

The new page style initially gets all properties of the selected page style.
Organiser
tab page, type a name for the page style in the
Name
box, for example &quot; My Landscape &quot; .
Next Style

See the section about the scope of page styles at the end of this help page.

All pages in the current scope of page styles will be changed.
If you defined the &quot; next style &quot; to be a different style, only the first page of the current scope of page styles will be changed.
The scope of page styles
You should be aware of the scope of page styles in %PRODUCTNAME.
Which pages of your text document get affected by editing a page style?
One page long styles
Format - Page - Organiser
tab page.
A one page long style starts from the lower border of the current page style range up to the next page break.
The next page break appears automatically when the text flows to the next page, which is sometimes called a &quot; soft page break &quot; .
Alternatively, you can insert a manual page break.
Ctrl+Enter
or choose
Insert - Manual Break
and just click OK.
Manually Defined Range of a Page style
Format - Page - Organiser
tab page.
Instead, the &quot; next style &quot; is set also to be “Default”.
All page styles that are followed by the same page style can span multiple pages.
The lower and upper borders of the page style range are defined by &quot; page breaks with style &quot; .
All the pages between any two &quot; page breaks with style &quot; use the same page style.
You can insert a &quot; page break with style &quot; directly at the cursor position.
Alternatively, you can apply the &quot; page break with style &quot; property to a paragraph or to a paragraph style.

Insert - Manual Break
