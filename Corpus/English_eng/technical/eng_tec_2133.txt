Database
You can insert fields from any database, for example, address fields, into your document.
Select
list, and then click
Insert
.
Field type
Meaning
Any Record
Record Number
box as a mail merge field if the
Condition
that you enter is met.
Only records selected by a multiple selection in the data source view are considered.
Any Record
field in front of the form letter fields that use a certain record.
Database Name
Database selection
box.
The &quot; Database Name &quot; field is a global field, that is, if you insert a different database name in your document, the contents of all previously inserted &quot; Database Name &quot; fields are updated.
Mail merge field
Inserts the name of a database field as a placeholder, so that you can create a mail merge document.
The field content is automatically inserted when you print the form letter.
Next record
Inserts the contents of the next mail merge field in your document, if the condition that you define is met.
The records that you want to include must be selected in the data source view.
You can use the &quot; Next record &quot; field to insert the contents of consecutive records between the mail merge fields in a document.
Record number
Inserts the number of the selected database record.
Database Selection
Select the database table or the database query that you want the field to refer to.
You can include fields from more than one database or query in a document.
For fields linked to a condition, enter the criteria here.
If you want, you can assign a condition that must be met before the contents of the &quot; Any Record &quot; and &quot; Next Record &quot; fields are inserted.
The default condition is &quot; True &quot; , that is, the condition is always true if you do not change the condition text.
Record number
Enter the number of the record that you want to insert when the condition that you specify is met.
The record number corresponds to the current selection in the data source view.
For example, if you select the last 5 records in a database containing 10 records, the number of the first record will be 1, and not 6.
If you refer to fields in a different database (or in a different table or query within the same database), $[officename] determines the record number relative to the current selection.
Format
Select the format of the field that you want to insert.
This option is available for numerical, boolean, date and time fields.
From database
Uses the format defined in the selected database.
