ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Gael de Chalendar
& kappname; is a computerized version of a well known strategy game. Commercial and other Free Software versions exist but I (GaÃ«l de Chalendar) created this game initially as a C++ learning exercise and so, I developed it up to this point (see README for details).
In the current version, & kappname; is a multi-player network-enabled game with an AI. (see TODO for details)
This documentation gives the major information you need to start playing. Please read the tooltips and the status bar messages to complete your information. A chapter explains how to create new skins for & kappname;
The goal of the game is simply to conquer the World... It is done by attacking your neighbors with your armies. Peaceful, is n't it: -)

Let's suppose you keep all the default settings and hit OK. You will then setup two players, one after one. For each one, you'll choose a name, a nationality and, if you want, setup a password such that nobody else than you can reuse this player when reloading this saved game. Lastly, you will here specify if this player is played by the computer or by a human being.

Distribution
At the beginning of the game, countries are distributed to all the players. Each country contains one army (represented by an infantryman) at the start. Each player has some armies to distribute to his countries at their turn (indicated by the presence of their name and their flag in the status bar). Note that five armies are represented by a cavalryman and 10 by a cannon.
To put an army on one of your countries, click on it with the left mouse button. To remove an army, click with the right button. Note, as a general rule, that you will never be able to remove more armies than the number you placed.
Placing armies
Placing armies
When a player has distributed all there armies, the next player is automatically selected to do the same task. When all players have finished to distributing their armies, there is two possibilities that can be selected by two buttons showed in the right panel:
Redistribution
Recycle
One player wants to change some of his choices. The first player can then remove an army he just put in a country with the right mouse button and put it in another one with the left mouse button. When he finishes, he gives control to next player with the Valid button. When all players have finished their redistribution, the two buttons are displayed again.
End of redistribution
Done
The redistribution is finished and the game can continue.
Fight
After the redistribution, a turn starts. Each player plays at his turn. He has the choice to:
Next player
Next Player
The turn of the current player finishes and it's the turn of the next one.
Attack 1
& nbsp; Attack 2 & nbsp; Attack 3 Attack with one, two or three armies & nbsp; Auto attack Auto attack
To attack, drag with the mouse from the attacking country and drop to the attacked one. You will then be presented with a contextual menu showing the above entries. Attack menu Attack menu For a country X to attack a country Y with x armies, 2 conditions must be fulfilled:
the two countries must be neighbors;
country X must have at least x+1 armies before the attack.
If the attack is valid, a dialog is displayed if necessary for the defender to choose if he wants to defend with one or two armies or let the computer decide.
When the defenders choice is done, the fight will occur and be completed. This will described below.

Move armies
Move Armies from one country to another
This is the last action of a player's turn. It gives the possibility to move some armies from one of his country to another, neighboring the first one. To choose the two countries, please drag and drop like you use during an attack. When both countries are selected, a slider is displayed on which you can choose how many armies there will be on each country afterwards.
Solution of the fight
For each army in the fight there is a corresponding die cast. The player who rolls a higher number on the dice, whether being from the attacker or defender, wins and the one to roll a smaller number on the dice loses armies according to the number of dice thrown.

If the number of armies in the defender country reaches 0, the ownership of this country changes to the attacker: his flag is set up and one of his attacking armies is installed in his new country. The "Move armies" slider is displayed as for the moves of the end of the turn.

End of the turn
To finish your current turn, if you do n't want to move armies, you can hit the Next Player button in the toolbar.
When everybody has played, the turn is finished. Some armies are distributed to the players, in function of the countries they own: 1 for each group of three countries, with a minimum of 3. There is also a bonus for players that own a complete continent, different for each one. The values of the bonuses for the default skin are:

When a player has finished distributing his armies, he clicks the Valid button to allow the next player to distribute his bonus armies. As for the initial distribution, when all player have placed their armies, they can start a new redistribution cycle or start a new turn...
Sending messages to other players
If you play a local game and want to communicate with the other players, well, let's speak (supposing you have no accessibility problems)... But if you are playing a network game, you can use the chat frame at the bottom of the window (it can be hidden or showed using the arrows). Just type in your message and hit & Enter;.

Developer's Guide to & kappname;
Please refer to http: / /api. kde. org/ for the documentation of the API. It was quite complete but is currently a little bit outdated. There are no comments in the. cpp implementation files.
Note that I originally developed this game under & Windows; with Borland C++ and WinG. I ported it to & Java; before converting back to C++ and & kde;. At the beginning I used French or a mix of French and English to name the identifiers (classnames, methods, members, & etc;). I also used French for the comments. When I decided to distribute this game, I decided to convert all to english... but I am clearly not a native English speaker: please suggest or make and submit corrections, to the code comments or to this documentation
Creating new skins
& kappname; comes with a skin editor, named ksirkskineditor(!), that allows to edit all skin data, as soon as graphics (map, sprites, etc.) are available in a SVG file. Please see the ksirkskineditor manual for further details.
