Introduction This assistant will guide you through the necessary steps to use a traditional KDE resource plugin to populate a folder of your Akonadi personal information setup with data otherwise not yet accessible through native Akonadi resources. The setup process consists of three steps: Step 1: Selecting a plugin suitable for the kind of data source you want to add; Step 2: Providing the selected plugin with information on where to find and how to access the data; Step 3: Naming the resulting data source so you can easily identify it in any application presenting you a choice of which data to process.
