Number Format Codes
Number format codes can consist of up to three sections separated by a semicolon (;).
In a number format code with two sections, the first section applies to positive values and zero, and the second section applies to negative values.
In a number format code with three sections, the first section applies to positive values, the second section to negative values, and the third section to the value zero.
You can also assign conditions to the three sections, so that the format is only applied if a condition is met.
Decimal Places and Significant Digits
Use zero (0) or the number sign (#) as placeholders in your number format code to represent numbers.
The (#) only displays significant digits, while the (0) displays zeros if there are fewer digits in the number than in the number format.
Use question marks (?) to represent the number of digits to include in the numerator and the denominator of a fraction.
Fractions that do not fit the pattern that you define are displayed as floating point numbers.
If a number contains more digits to the right of the decimal delimiter than there are placeholders in the format, the number is rounded accordingly.
If a number contains more digits to the left of the decimal delimiter than there are placeholders in the format, the entire number is displayed.
Use the following list as a guide for using placeholders when you create a number format code:
Placeholders
Explanation
#
Does not display extra zeros.
0 (Zero)
Displays extra zeros if the number has fewer places than zeros in the format.
Examples:
Number Format
Format Code
3456.78 as 3456.8
####.#
9.9 as 9.900
#.000
13 as 13.0 and 1234.567 as 1234.57
#.0#
5.75 as 5 3/4 and 6.3 as 6 3/10
# ???/???
.5 as 0.5
0.##
Thousands Separator
Depending on your language setting, you can use a comma or a dot-on-the-line as a thousands separator.
You can also use the separator to reduce the size of the number that is displayed by a multiple of 1000.

Colour
To set the colour of a section of a number format code, insert one of the following colour names in square brackets []:
CYAN
GREEN
BLACK
BLUE
MAGENTA
RED
WHITE
YELLOW
Conditions
Conditional Brackets
You can define a number format so that it only applies when the condition that you specify is met.
Conditions are enclosed by square brackets [ ].
You can use any combination of numbers and the < , < =, > , > =, = and < > operators.
For example, if you want to apply different colours to different temperature data, enter:
[BLUE][ < 0]#,0 &quot; °C &quot; ;[RED][ > 30]#,0 &quot; °C &quot; ;[BLACK]#,0 &quot; °C &quot;
All temperatures below zero are blue, temperatures between 0 and 30 °C are black, and temperatures higher than 30 °C are red.
Positive and Negative Numbers
To define a number format that adds a different text to a number depending on if the number is positive, negative, or equal to zero, use the following format:
&quot; plus &quot; 0; &quot; minus &quot; 0; &quot; null &quot; 0
Percentages and Scientific Notation
Percentages
To display numbers as percentages, (numbers that are multiplied by 100) add the percent sign (%) to the number format.
Scientific Notation
%PRODUCTNAME
, these numbers are written as 6.5E+5 and 6.5E-5, respectively.
To create a number format that displays numbers using scientific notation, enter a # or 0, and then one of the following codes E-, E+, e- or e+.
Number Format Codes of Currency Formats
The default currency format for the cells in your spreadsheet is determined by the regional setting of your operating system.
If you want, you can apply a custom currency symbol to a cell.
For example, enter #,##0.00 € to display 4.50 € (euros).

M, T, S, H)
G

GGG
Number of the year within an era, without a leading zero for single-digit years
E
Number of the year within an era, with a leading zero for single-digit years
EE or R
Era, full name and year
RR or GGGEE
The above listed formatting codes work with your language version of %PRODUCTNAME.
However, when you need to switch the locale of %PRODUCTNAME to another locale, you will need to know the formatting codes used in that other locale.
For example, if your software is set to an English locale, and you want to format a year with four digits, you enter YYYY as a formatting code.
When you switch to a German locale, you must use JJJJ instead.
The following table lists only the localised differences.

Entering Dates
To enter a date in a cell, use the Gregorian calendar format.
For example, in an English (British: en-GB) locale, enter 01/02/2002 for 2nd January 2002.
Tools - Options - Language settings - Languages
.
For example, if your locale is set to 'Japanese', then the Gengou calendar is used.
The default date format in
%PRODUCTNAME
uses the Gregorian Calendar.
To specify a calendar format that is independent of the locale, add a modifier in front of the date format.
For example, to display a date using the Jewish calendar format in a non-Hebrew locale, enter:
[~jewish]DD/MM/YYYY.

If you perform a calculation that involves one or more cells using a date format, the result is formatted according to the following mappings:

The Date & Time format displays the date and time that an entry was made to a cell with this format.
%PRODUCTNAME
, a date with the value &quot; 0 &quot; corresponds to Dec 30, 1899.
Time Formats
To display hours, minutes and seconds use the following number format codes.
Format

Hours as 0-23
h
Hours as 00-23
hh
Minutes as 0-59
m
Minutes as 00-59
mm
Seconds as 0-59
s
Seconds as 00-59
ss
hh:mm:ss.00
to display the time as &quot; 01:02:03.45 &quot; .
If a time is entered in the form 02:03.45 or 01:02:03.45 or 25:01:02, the following formats are assigned if no other time format has been specified:
MM:SS.00 or [HH]:MM:SS.00 or [HH]:MM:SS
Displaying Numbers Using Native Characters
To display numbers using native number characters, use a [NatNum1], [NatNum2], ...
[NatNum11] modifier at the beginning of a number format codes.
The [NatNum1] modifier always uses a one to one character mapping to convert numbers to a string that matches the native number format code of the corresponding locale.
The other modifiers produce different results if they are used with different locales.
A locale can be the language and the territory for which the format code is defined, or a modifier such as [$-yyy] that follows the native number modifier.
In this case, yyy is the hexadecimal Microsoft LCID that is also used in currency format codes.
For example, to display a number using Japanese short Kanji characters in an English US locale, use the following number format code:
[NatNum1][$-411]0
%PRODUCTNAME
[NatNum] modifier is shown.
If you want, you can use a [DBNumX] modifier instead of [NatNum] modifier for your locale.
Whenever possible,
%PRODUCTNAME
internally maps [DBNumX] modifiers to [NatNumN] modifiers.
Displaying dates using [NatNum] modifiers can have a different effect than displaying other types of numbers.
Such effects are indicated by 'CAL: '.
For example, 'CAL:
1/4/4' indicates that the year is displayed using the [NatNum1] modifier, while the day and month are displayed using the [NatNum4] modifier.
If 'CAL' is not specified, the date formats for that particular modifier are not supported.
