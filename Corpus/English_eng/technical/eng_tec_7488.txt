EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
NOBILIS IB 4-91
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Nobilis IB 4-91?
Nobilis IB 4-91 is a lyophilised (freeze dried) vaccine pellet which is made into a solution for dosing.
Nobilis IB 4-91 contains the live attenuated (altered so that it does not cause the disease) avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV).
What is Nobilis IB 4-91 used for?
Nobilis IB 4-91 is used to immunise chickens to reduce the respiratory signs of Infectious Bronchitis caused by the variant strain IB 4-91, which causes infectious bronchitis in chickens.
Nobilis IB 4-91 can be given to 1-day-old chicks and older chickens by coarse spray or by intranasal (breathed in through the nose) or ocular (absorbed by the eyes) administration.
The vaccine can be given to 7-day and older chickens in their drinking water.
For long-lasting immunity, chickens should be revaccinated every 6 weeks.
How does Nobilis IB 4-91 work?
Nobilis IB 4-91 contains the live IBV virus that has been attenuated (altered) so that it does not cause the disease.
When the chickens are exposed to this attenuated virus, this small exposure helps the chickens’ immune systems to recognise and attack the IBV virus.
When exposed to IBV later in life, the chickens will either not become infected or have a much less serious infection.
How has the effectiveness of Nobilis IB 4-91 been studied?
The Nobilis IB 4-91 vaccine has been studied in various vaccination schedules in a number of trials The vaccine was given by coarse spray to chicken of various ages.
The main measures of effectiveness included the development of antibodies to the IB 4-91 virus, the overall death rate of the chickens and the percentage of chicken rejected because of disease..
Nobilis IB 4-91 vaccine has also been compared with controls, i. e. chickens that were not vaccinated.

There was a clear immune response to Nobilis IB 4-91.
In one trial, after three weeks 100% of chickens had developed antibodies to the IB 4-91 virus compared with 17% for the controls.
What are the side effects of Nobilis IB 4-91?
Nobilis IB 4-91 can cause mild respiratory signs of disease which may last for a few days depending on the health and condition of the chickens.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
There are no precautions for the person, but it is recommended that they wash and disinfect hands and equipment after vaccinating to avoid spread of the virus.
Why has Nobilis IB 4-91 been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) agreed that the benefits of Nobilis IB 4-91 are greater than any risks to immunise chickens to reduce the respiratory signs of infectious bronchitis caused by the variant strain IB 4-91.
They recommended that Nobilis IB 4-91 should be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about Nobilis IB 4-91:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Nobilis IB 4-91 to Intervet International B. V. on 9 June 1998.
