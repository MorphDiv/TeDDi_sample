(PHP 4 = 4.0.2)
pfpro_cleanup() is used to shutdown the Payflow Pro library cleanly.
It should be called after you have processed any transactions and before the end of your script.
However you may omit this call, in which case this extension will automatically call pfpro_cleanup() after your script terminates.
See also pfpro_init().
