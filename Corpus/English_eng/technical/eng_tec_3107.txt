(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
html_entity_decode() is the opposite of htmlentities() in that it converts all HTML entities to their applicable characters from string.
The optional second quote_style parameter lets you define what will be done with 'single' and "double "quotes.
It takes on one of three constants with the default being ENT_COMPAT:
Table 1.
Available quote_style constants
Constant Name
Description
ENT_COMPAT
Will convert double-quotes and leave single-quotes alone.
ENT_QUOTES
Will convert both double and single quotes.
ENT_NOQUOTES
Will leave both double and single quotes unconverted.
The ISO-8859-1 character set is used as default for the optional third charset.
This defines the character set used in conversion.
Example 1.
Decoding html entities
?php $orig = "I'll \"walk\" the b dog / b now"; $a = htmlentities($orig); $b = html_entity_decode($a); echo $a; / / I'll quot;walk quot; the lt;b gt;dog lt; / b gt; now echo $b; / / I'll "walk "the b dog / b now / / For users prior to PHP 4.3.0 you may do this: function unhtmlentities ($string) {$trans_tbl = get_html_translation_table (HTML_ENTITIES); $trans_tbl = array_flip ($trans_tbl); return strtr ($string, $trans_tbl);} $c = unhtmlentities($a); echo $c; / / I'll "walk" the b dog / b now?
Note:
You might wonder why trim( html_entity_decode( 'nbsp ;')); doesn't reduce the string to an empty string, that's because the' nbsp; 'entity is not ASCII code 32 (which is stripped by trim()) but ASCII code 160 (0xa0) in the default ISO 8859-1 characterset.
