Sets the indent, spacing, and alignment options for the numbered or bulleted list.
do we have a how-to for numbering/bullets/outlines with/without styles? seems we really need one
The Position tab page looks different for documents using the new position and spacing attributes introduced with OpenOffice.org 3.0, or documents using the old attributes from versions before 3.0.
The new version of this tab page shows the controls &quot; Numbering followed by &quot; , &quot; Numbering alignment &quot; , &quot; Aligned at &quot; , and &quot; Indent at &quot; .
The old version of this tab page that can be seen in an old numbered or bulleted list shows the controls &quot; Indent &quot; , &quot; Width of numbering &quot; , &quot; Minimum space numbering < - > text &quot; , and &quot; Numbering alignment &quot; .

Select the level(s) that you want to modify.
