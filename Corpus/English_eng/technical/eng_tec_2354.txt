(PHP 4 = 4.0.1)
array_diff() returns an array containing all the values of array1 that are not present in any of the other arguments.
Note that keys are preserved.
Example 1. array_diff() example
$array1 = array ("a "= "green", "red", "blue", "red"); $array2 = array ("b" = "green", "yellow", "red"); $result = array_diff ($array1, $array2);
This makes $result have array ("blue");.
Multiple occurrences in $array1 are all treated the same way.
Note:
Two elements are considered equal if and only if (string) $elem1 === (string) $elem2.
In words: when the string representation is the same.
Note:
Please note that this function only checks one dimension of a n-dimensional array.
Of course you can check deeper dimensions by using array_diff( $array1[0], $array2[0]);.
Warning
This was broken in PHP 4.0.4!
