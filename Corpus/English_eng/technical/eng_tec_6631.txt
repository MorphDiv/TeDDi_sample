K3bSetup
(C) 2003-2007 Sebastian Trueg

This simple setup assistant is able to set the permissions needed by K3b in order to burn CDs and DVDs. It does not take things like devfs or resmgr into account. In most cases this is not a problem but on some systems the permissions may be altered the next time you login or restart your computer. In those cases it is best to consult the distribution documentation. Caution: Although K3b: :Setup should not be able to mess up your system no guarantee can be given.
K3b: :SetupThis simple setup assistant is able to set the permissions needed by K3b in order to burn CDs and DVDs. It does not take into account devfs or resmgr, or similar. In most cases this is not a problem, but on some systems the permissions may be altered the next time you login or restart your computer. In these cases it is best to consult the distribution's documentation. The important task that K3b: :Setup performs is grant write access to the CD and DVD devices.
