ftp_nb_fput() uploads the data from the file pointer fp ftp_nb_fput() uploads the data from the file pointer fp until it reaches the end of the file.
The results are stored in remote_file on the FTP server.
The transfer mode specified must be either FTP_ASCII or FTP_BINARY.
The difference between this function and the ftp_fput() is that this function uploads the file asynchronously, so your program can perform other operations while the file is being downloaded.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
See also ftp_nb_put(), ftp_nb_continue(), ftp_put() and ftp_fput().
