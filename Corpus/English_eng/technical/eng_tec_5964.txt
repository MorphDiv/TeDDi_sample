The maximum number of "tiles" that are kept in memory. For regular RGBA8 images, each tile is about 16 kB in size. Thus, for a value of 500 tiles this usually means about 8 megabytes are used for image data. If you regularly handle large images, a greater value here might be useful. Note that this number is only a guideline for Krita, and is not guaranteed to be the actual number of tiles in memory.
Maximum number of tiles kept in memory:
This configures how much Krita will use the swap file. If you move the slider all the way to the left, Krita will not use the swap file at all. If you move it all the way to the right, Krita will make maximum use of the swap file.
Swappiness:
This configures how much Krita likes to swap. Move the slider to the left, and there is no swapping at all. Move it to the right there is a lot of swapping going on.

Hue hopefully maintained (but not required), lightness and saturation sacrificed to maintain the perceived color. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for images.
Within and outside gamut; same as Absolute Colorimetric. White point changed to result in neutral grays.
Relative colorimetric
Hue and saturation maintained with lightness sacrificed to maintain saturation. White point changed to result in neutral grays. Intended for business graphics (make it colorful charts, graphs, overheads,...)
Within the destination device gamut; hue, lightness and saturation are maintained. Outside the gamut; hue and lightness are maintained, saturation is sacrificed. White point for source and destination; unchanged. Intended for spot colors (Pantone, TruMatch, logo colors,...)

Use interlacing when publishing on the Internet.
Interlacing is useful if you intend to publish your image on the Internet. Enabling interlacing will cause the image to be displayed by the browser even while downloading.
Interlacing
Disable to get smaller files if your image has no transparency
The Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format allows transparency in your image to be stored by saving an alpha channel. You can uncheck the box if you are not using transparency and you want to make the resulting file smaller. Always saving the alpha channel is recommended.
Store alpha channel (transparency)
Indexed PNG images are smaller. If you enabled this option, your image will be analyzed to see whether it is possible to save as an indexed PNG.

Pasting data from simple source
The image data you are trying to paste has no color profile information. On the web and in simple applications the data are supposed to be in sRGB color format. Importing as web will show it as it is supposed to look. Most monitors are not perfect though so if you made the image yourself you might want to import it as it looked on you monitor. How do you want to interpret these data?

MyPaint brush
The pressure reported by the tablet, between 0.0 and 1.0. If you use the mouse, it will be 0.5 when a button is pressed and 0.0 otherwise.
How fast you currently move. This can change very quickly. Try'print input values' from the'help 'menu to get a feeling for the range; negative values are rare but possible for very low speed.
Same as speed1, but changes slower. Also look at the'speed2 filter 'setting.
Fast random noise, changing at each evaluation. Evenly distributed between 0 and 1.
This input slowly goes from zero to one while you draw a stroke. It can also be configured to jump back to zero periodically while you move. Look at the'stroke duration 'and'stroke hold time' settings.
The angle of the stroke, in degrees. The value will stay between 0.0 and 180.0, effectively ignoring turns of 180 degrees.
This is a user defined input. Look at the'custom input 'setting for details.
opaque
0 means brush is transparent, 1 fully visible (also known as alpha or opacity)
opaque multiply
This gets multiplied with opaque. It is used for making opaque depend on pressure (or other inputs).
opaque linearize
Correct the nonlinearity introduced by blending multiple dabs on top of each other. This correction should get you a linear ("natural") pressure response when pressure is mapped to opaque_multiply, as it is usually done. 0.9 is good for standard strokes, set it smaller if your brush scatters a lot, or higher if you use dabs_per_second. 0.0 the opaque value above is for the individual dabs 1.0 the opaque value above is for the final brush stroke, assuming each pixel gets (dabs_per_radius*2) brushdabs on average during a stroke
basic brush radius (logarithmic) 0.7 means 2 pixels 3.0 means 20 pixels
hardness
hard brush-circle borders (setting to zero will draw nothing)
dabs per basic radius
how many dabs to draw while the pointer moves a distance of one brush radius (more precise: the base value of the radius)
dabs per actual radius
same as above, but the radius actually drawn is used, which can change dynamically
dabs per second
dabs to draw each second, no matter how far the pointer moves
radius by random
Alter the radius randomly each dab. You can also do this with the by_random input on the radius setting. If you do it here, there are two differences: 1) the opaque value will be corrected such that a big-radius dabs is more transparent 2) it will not change the actual radius seen by dabs_per_actual_radius
speed1 filter
how slowly the input speed1 follows the real speed. 0.0 changes immediately as your speed changes (not recommended, but try it.)
speed2 filter
same as'speed1 slowness' but note that the range is different
speed1 gamma
This changes the reaction of the speed1 input to extreme physical speed. You will see the difference best if speed1 is mapped to the radius. -8.0 very fast speed does not increase speed1 much more +8.0 very fast speed increases speed1 a lot For very slow speed the opposite happens.
speed2 gamma
same as'speed1 gamma 'for speed2
jitter
add a random offset to the position where each dab is drawn 0.0 disabled 1.0 standard deviation is one basic radius away < 0.0 negative values produce no jitter
offset by speed
change position depending on pointer speed = 0 disable > 0 draw where the pointer moves to < 0 draw where the pointer comes from
offset by speed filter
how slow the offset goes back to zero when the cursor stops moving
slow position tracking
Slowdown pointer tracking speed. 0 disables it, higher values remove more jitter in cursor movements. Useful for drawing smooth, comic-like outlines.
slow tracking per dab
Similar as above but at brushdab level (ignoring how much time has past, if brushdabs do not depend on time)
tracking noise
add randomness to the mouse pointer; this usually generates many small lines in random directions; maybe try this together with'slow tracking '
color hue
color saturation
color value
color value (brightness, intensity)
change color hue
Change color hue. -0.1 small clockwise color hue shift 0.0 disable 0.5 counterclockwise hue shift by 180 degrees
change color lightness (HSL)
Change the color lightness (luminance) using the HSL color model. -1.0 blacker 0.0 disable 1.0 whiter
change color satur. (HSL)
Change the color saturation using the HSL color model. -1.0 more grayish 0.0 disable 1.0 more saturated
change color value (HSV)
Change the color value (brightness, intensity) using the HSV color model. HSV changes are applied before HSL. -1.0 darker 0.0 disable 1.0 brigher
change color satur. (HSV)
Change the color saturation using the HSV color model. HSV changes are applied before HSL. -1.0 more grayish 0.0 disable 1.0 more saturated
smudge
Paint with the smudge color instead of the brush color. The smudge color is slowly changed to the color you are painting on. 0.0 do not use the smudge color 0.5 mix the smudge color with the brush color 1.0 use only the smudge color
smudge length
This controls how fast the smudge color becomes the color you are painting on. 0.0 immediately change the smudge color 1.0 never change the smudge color
eraser
how much this tool behaves like an eraser 0.0 normal painting 1.0 standard eraser 0.5 pixels go towards 50% transparency
stroke threshold
How much pressure is needed to start a stroke. This affects the stroke input only. Mypaint does not need a minimal pressure to start drawing.
stroke duration
How far you have to move until the stroke input reaches 1.0. This value is logarithmic (negative values will not invert the process).
stroke hold time
This defines how long the stroke input stays at 1.0. After that it will reset to 0.0 and start growing again, even if the stroke is not yet finished. 2.0 means twice as long as it takes to go from 0.0 to 1.0 9.9 and bigger stands for infinite
custom input
Set the custom input to this value. If it is slowed down, move it towards this value (see below). The idea is that you make this input depend on a mixture of pressure/ speed/ whatever, and then make other this depend on this'custom input 'instead of repeating this combination everywhere you need it. If you make it change'by random' you can generate a slow (smooth) random input.
custom input filter
How slow the custom input actually follows the desired value (the one above). This happens at brushdab level (ignoring how much time has past, if brushdabs do not depend on time). 0.0 no slowdown (changes apply instantly)
elliptical dab: ratio
aspect ratio of the dabs; must be > = 1.0, where 1.0 means a perfectly round dab. TODO: linearize? start at 0.0 maybe, or log?
elliptical dab: angle
this defines the angle by which eliptical dabs are tilted 0.0 horizontal dabs 45.0 45 degrees, turned clockwise 180.0 horizontal again
direction filter
a low value will make the direction input adapt more quickly, a high value will make it smoother
