Introduction
Gametype:
Board, Arcade
Number of possible players:
One
& kappname; is a simple one player strategy game played against the computer. The playing field is an 8 by 8 square board divided into 64 squares. The game pieces used are two sided stones, where each side has its own, distinctive color. If a piece is captured by an opposing player, that piece is turned over to reveal the color of that player. A winner is declared when one player has more pieces of his own color on the board and there are no more possible moves.
How to Play
Objective:
Get control over the majority of squares on the board.
& kappname; loads directly into the game play mode. As a first player you have the right to move first.
Note:
By default the human player always has a right to the first move.
Now, imagine yourself that with each move your stone has to hop (jump) over the enemy's one (or ones, as there might be more than one stone). Yet, your stone does not relocate after the move, instead a new stone is placed on the board onto where your stone would have appeared if it indeed could jump. Once the move is done, all the enemy stones that you jump over, become yours and change their color respectively.
Every single move you do in & kappname; has to be done in this manner. And you can jump your stones vertically, horizontally and diagonally. But, in case there is nowhere to jump, your turn will automatically skip.
The same rule applies to your enemy. If there is no possibility to make a move the turn is skipped.
The idea here is to fill the board with the stones of your own color. The player who manages to conquer the most of the game board is announced the winner.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Game Basics
A move consists of outflanking your opponents stone(s), then flipping the outflanked stone(s) to reveal your color. A move is performed by placing the mouse pointer over the desired square then & LMB; click.
To outflank means to place a stone on the board so that your opponent's row(s) of stone(s) is bordered at each end by a stone of your color. A row may be made up of one or more stones.
The game starts with each player having two stones automatically placed in the center four squares of the board in the following pattern:
kappname; opening position
kappname; opening position
Board Layout
Menu Bar
The Menu Bar contains several choices of drop-down menus. These are Game, Move, View, Settings, and Help. Click with the & LMB; or Alt; the underlined letter to show the drop-down menu.
Toolbar
Provides the player with icon shortcuts for commonly used actions. These are New, Undo, Hint, Demo, Show Last Move, and Show Legal Moves. Place the mouse pointer over any of these icons and click with the & LMB; to activate.
Game Board
The game board consists of a 8 by 8 square board divided into 64 squares.
Status Bar
The status bar displays whose turn it is.
Game Rules
You always move first.
If on your turn you cannot outflank and flip at least one opposing stone, your turn is forfeited and your opponent moves again. However, if a move is available to you, you may not forfeit your turn.
A stone may outflank any number of stones in one or more rows in any number of directions at the same time - horizontally, vertically or diagonally. A row is defined as one or more stones in a continuous straight line.
You may not skip over your own color stone to outflank an opposing stone.
Stones may only be outflanked as a direct result of a move and must fall in the direct line of the stone placed down.
All stones outflanked in any one move must be flipped, even if it is to the player's advantage not to flip them.
Once a stone is placed on a square, it can never be moved to another square later in the game.
When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over. Stones are then counted and the player with the majority of his or her color discs on the board is declared the winner.
It is possible for a game to end before all 64 squares are filled.
Strategies and Tips
Try to place stones on the corners whenever possible. Your opponent cannot outflank these stones.
Avoid placing stones on one of the three neighbor fields of a corner unless you are absolutely sure that your opponent will not be able to put a stone on a corner.
Sometimes it is better to offer some stones to your opponent.
Try to put stones on fields which prevent your opponent from moving.
Try to force your opponent to put a stone in a neighboring field of a corner.
