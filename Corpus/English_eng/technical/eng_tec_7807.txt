EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ECALTA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is ECALTA?
ECALTA is a powder and solvent that are made up into a concentrate, which is diluted to make a solution for infusion (drip into a vein).
It contains the active substance anidulafungin.
What is ECALTA used for?
ECALTA is used to treat invasive candidiasis (a type of fungal infection caused by a yeast-like fungus called Candida sp.). ‘ Invasive ’ means that the fungus has spread into the blood.
ECALTA is only used in adults who are not neutropenic (who do not have low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is ECALTA used?
Treatment with ECALTA should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the management of invasive fungal infections.
ECALTA is given as an initial dose of 200 mg on day one, followed by 100 mg each day from day two.
ECALTA should only be given by infusion, at a maximum rate of 1.1 mg per minute to avoid side effects: this corresponds to about three hours for the initial infusion, and one and a half hours for the subsequent infusions.
The duration of treatment depends on how the patient responds.
In general, treatment should continue for at least two weeks after the last time that fungus is found in the patient ’ s blood.
How does ECALTA work?
The active substance in ECALTA, anidulafungin, is an antifungal medicine, which belongs to the group ‘ echinocandins’.
It works by interfering with the production of a component of the fungal cell wall called 1,3-β -D-glucan, which is necessary if the fungus is to continue living and growing.
Fungal cells treated with ECALTA have incomplete or defective cell walls, making them fragile and unable to grow.
The list of fungi against which ECALTA is active can be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics (also part of the EPAR).
How has ECALTA been studied?
The effects of ECALTA were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
ECALTA has been studied in one main study involving 261 patients with invasive candidiasis.
The effects of ECALTA were compared with those of fluconazole (another antifungal medicine).
Both medicines were given by infusion, for between 14 and 42 days.

A response was defined as a significant or complete improvement of symptoms, with no need for further antifungal treatment and no Candida found in the specimens taken from the patient.
What benefit has ECALTA shown during the studies?
ECALTA was more effective than fluconazole in treating invasive candidiasis.
At the end of intravenous therapy, 96 (76%) of the 127 patients receiving ECALTA had responded to treatment, compared with 71 (60%) of the 118 receiving fluconazole.
What is the risk associated with ECALTA?
The most common side effects with ECALTA (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are coagulopathy (problems with blood clotting), convulsion (fits), headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), increased blood creatinine levels (a marker of kidney problems), rash, pruritus (itching), hypokalaemia (low levels of potassium in the blood), flushing, and raised blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin and gamma- glutamyltransferase (markers of liver problems).
For the full list of all side effects reported with ECALTA, see the Package Leaflet.
ECALTA should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to anidulafungin or any of the other ingredients, or to any other medicines in the echinocandin class.
Once made up into an infusion, ECALTA contains alcohol in an amount that is comparable to a small glass of wine or beer.
This will need to be taken into consideration when it is given to some patients (such as pregnant women, alcoholic patients or those with liver disease).
Because ECALTA can affect liver function, patients who show signs of liver problems during treatment should be carefully monitored.
Why has ECALTA been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ECALTA’ s benefits are greater than its risks in the treatment of invasive candidiasis in adult non-neutropenic patients.
However, the Committee noted that the main study of ECALTA included an insufficient number of patients with neutropenia to demonstrate the medicine ’ s effectiveness in this group.
In addition, it noted that ECALTA has been studied mainly in patients with candidaemia (Candida sp. in the blood), and only in a limited number of patients with deep tissue infections or abscesses.
The Committee recommended that ECALTA be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about ECALTA:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for ECALTA to Pfizer Limited on 20 September 2007.
