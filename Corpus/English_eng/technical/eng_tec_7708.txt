NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Efficib 50 mg/ 850 mg film-coated tablets
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each tablet contains 50 mg of sitagliptin (as phosphate monohydrate) and 850 mg of metformin hydrochloride.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet (tablet).
Capsule-shaped, pink film-coated tablet with “ 515” debossed on one side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus:
Efficib is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or those already being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin.
Efficib is also indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i. e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The dose of antihyperglycaemic therapy with Efficib should be individualised on the basis of the patient’ s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg sitagliptin.
For patients inadequately controlled on maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy For patients not adequately controlled on metformin alone, the usual starting dose of Efficib should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken.
For patients switching from co-administration of sitagliptin and metformin For patients switching from co-administration of sitagliptin and metformin, Efficib should be initiated at the dose of sitagliptin and metformin already being taken.
For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with the maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea The dose of Efficib should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken.
When Efficib is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).
2 For the different doses on metformin, Efficib is available in strengths of 50 mg sitagliptin and 850 mg metformin hydrochloride or 1000 mg metformin hydrochloride.
All patients should continue their diet with an adequate distribution of carbohydrate intake during the day.
Overweight patients should continue their energy-restricted diet.
Efficib should be given twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal undesirable effects associated with metformin.
Patients with renal insufficiency Efficib should not be used in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Patients with hepatic insufficiency Efficib should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).
Elderly As metformin and sitagliptin are excreted by the kidney, Efficib should be used with caution as age increases.
Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Limited safety data on sitagliptin is available in patients > 75 years of age and care should be exercised.
Paediatric population Efficib is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on its safety and efficacy in this population.
4.3 Contraindications
Efficib is contraindicated in patients with:
- hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8);
- diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic pre-coma;
- moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min) (see section 4.4);
- acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as:
- - - -
dehydration, severe infection, shock, intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see section 4.4);
- acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as:
- - -
cardiac or respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction, shock;
- hepatic impairment;
- acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism;
- lactation.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Efficib should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes and must not be used for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Lactic acidosis Lactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious (high mortality in the absence of prompt treatment), metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation.
Reported cases of lactic acidosis in patients on metformin have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal failure.
The incidence of lactic acidosis can and should be reduced by also assessing other associated
3 risk factors such as poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency and any conditions associated with hypoxia.
Diagnosis Lactic acidosis is characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain and hypothermia followed by coma.
Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH, plasma lactate levels above 5 mmol/ l, and an increased anion gap and lactate/ pyruvate ratio.
If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment with the medicinal product should be discontinued and the patient hospitalised immediately (see section 4.9).
Renal function Metformin and sitagliptin are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney.
Metformin-related lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function, therefore, serum creatinine concentrations should be determined regularly:
- at least once a year in patients with normal renal function
- at least two to four times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at or above the upper
limit of normal and in elderly patients.
Decreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic.
Special caution should be exercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating antihypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
Hypoglycaemia Patients receiving Efficib in combination with a sulphonylurea may be at risk for hypoglycaemia.
Therefore, a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea may be necessary.
The use of Efficib in combination with insulin has not been adequately studied.
Hypersensitivity reactions Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin have been reported.
These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose.
If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue Efficib, assess for other potential causes of the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes (see section 4.8).
Surgery As Efficib contains metformin hydrochloride, the treatment should be discontinued 48 hours before elective surgery with general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia.
Efficib should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 hours afterwards and only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal.
Administration of iodinated contrast agent The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies can lead to renal failure which has been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin.
Therefore, Efficib should be discontinued prior to, or at the time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal (see section 4.5).
4 Change in clinical status of patients with previously controlled type 2 diabetes A patient with type 2 diabetes previously well controlled on Efficib who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis.
Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate, pyruvate, and metformin levels.
If acidosis of either form occurs, Efficib must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Co-administration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg twice daily) and metformin (1,000 mg twice daily) did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with Efficib have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual active substances of Efficib, sitagliptin and metformin.
There is increased risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication (particularly in the case of fasting, malnutrition or hepatic insufficiency) due to the metformin active substance of Efficib (see section 4.4).
Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be avoided.
Cationic agents that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e. g., cimetidine) may interact with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems.
A study conducted in seven normal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, increased metformin systemic exposure (AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%.
Therefore, close monitoring of glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic treatment should be considered when cationic agents that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion are co-administered.
The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies may lead to renal failure, resulting in metformin accumulation and a risk of lactic acidosis.
Therefore, Efficib should be discontinued prior to, or at the time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal (see section 4.4).
Combination requiring precautions for use Glucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes) beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity.
The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring performed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products.
If necessary, the dose of the anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation.
ACE-inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels.
If necessary, the dose of the antihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation.
Effects of other medicinal products on sitagliptin Clinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions following co- administration of other medicinal products is low.
Cyclosporine:
A study was conducted to assess the effect of cyclosporine, a potent inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.
Co-administration of a single 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin and a single 600 mg oral dose of cyclosporine increased the AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin by approximately 29% and 68%, respectively.
These changes in sitagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically meaningful.
The renal clearance of sitagliptin was not meaningfully altered.
Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p-glycoprotein inhibitors.
5 In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin is CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8.
In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, including via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin.
Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal insufficiency or ESRD.
For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i. e., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal insufficiency or ESRD.
The effects of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the setting of renal insufficiency has not been assessed in a clinical study.
In vitro transport studies showed that sitagliptin is a substrate for p-glycoprotein and OAT3.
OAT3 mediated transport of sitagliptin was inhibited in vitro by probenecid, although the risk of clinically meaningful interactions is considered to be low.
Concomitant administration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo.
Effects of sitagliptin on other medicinal products In vitro data suggest that sitagliptin does not inhibit nor induce CYP450 isoenzymes.
In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).
Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations, and may be a mild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein in vivo.
Digoxin:
Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations.
Following administration of 0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of sitagliptin daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of digoxin was increased on average by 11%, and the plasma Cmax on average by 18%.
No dose adjustment of digoxin is recommended.
However, patients at risk of digoxin toxicity should be monitored for this when sitagliptin and digoxin are administered concomitantly.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of sitagliptin in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at high doses of sitagliptin (see section 5.3).
A limited amount of data suggest the use of metformin in pregnant women is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations.
Animal studies with metformin do not indicate harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see also section 5.3).
Efficib should not be used during pregnancy.
If a patient wishes to become pregnant or if a pregnancy occurs, treatment with Efficib should be discontinued and switched to insulin treatment as soon as possible.
No studies in lactating animals have been conducted with the combined active substances of Efficib.
In studies performed with the individual active substances, both sitagliptin and metformin are excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Metformin is excreted in human milk in small amounts.
It is not known whether sitagliptin is excreted in human milk.
Efficib must therefore not be used in women who are breast-feeding (see section 4.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed with Efficib.
However, when driving or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and somnolence have been reported with sitagliptin.
In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when Efficib is used in combination with other sulfonylurea agents.
6 4.8 Undesirable effects
There have been no therapeutic clinical trials conducted with Efficib tablets however bioequivalence of Efficib with co-administered sitagliptin and metformin has been demonstrated (see section 5.2).
Sitagliptin and metformin Adverse reactions considered as drug related reported in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of placebo and in patients receiving sitagliptin in combination with metformin in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency (Table 1).
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).

Very common
In clinical trials of sitagliptin as monotherapy and sitagliptin as part of combination therapy with metformin, rates of hypoglycaemia reported with sitagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo.
1 In this placebo-controlled 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to treatment with placebo added to ongoing metformin was 9.3% and 10.1%, respectively.
In an additional 1-year study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to sulphonylurea added to ongoing metformin was 14.5% and 30.3%, respectively.
In pooled studies of up to 1 year in duration comparing sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin to a sulphonylurea agent added to ongoing metformin, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg occurring in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving the sulphonylurea agent are as follows: anorexia (Metabolism and nutritional disorders; frequency uncommon) and weight decreased (Investigations; frequency uncommon).
2 In this 24-week placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing combination treatment with glimepiride and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the addition of sitagliptin to the ongoing treatment
7 with glimepiride and metformin was 18.1% compared to treatment with the addition of placebo to the ongoing treatment with glimepiride and metformin which was 7.1%.
In a 24-week study of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin administered twice daily (sitagliptin/ metformin 50 mg/ 500 mg or 50 mg/ 1,000 mg), the overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin compared to patients treated with placebo was 14.0% and 9.7%, respectively.
The overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was comparable to metformin alone (14.0% each) and greater than sitagliptin alone (6.7%), with the differences relative to sitagliptin alone primarily due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
Additional information on the individual active substances of the fixed dose combination Sitagliptin In addition, in monotherapy studies of up to 24 weeks in duration of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily alone compared to placebo, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving placebo are headache, hypoglycaemia, constipation, and dizziness.
In addition to the drug related adverse reactions described above, adverse events (reported regardless of causal relationship to medicinal product) occurring in at least 5% and more commonly in patients treated with sitagliptin included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis.
Additional adverse events that occurred more frequently in patients treated with sitagliptin (not reaching the 5% level, but occurring with an incidence of > 0.5% higher with sitagliptin than that in the control group) included osteoarthritis and pain in extremity.
Across clinical studies, a small increase in white blood cell (WBC) count (approximately 200 cells/ microl difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6,600 cells/ microl) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils.
This observation was seen in most but not all studies.
This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant.
No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed with sitagliptin treatment.
Post-marketing data
During post-marketing experience of Efficib or sitagliptin, one of the active substances of Efficib, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported (frequency not known): hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (see section 4.4).

and loss of appetite most cases.
Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e. g., megaloblastic anaemia).
4.9 Overdose
No data are available with regard to overdose of Efficib.
During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were generally well tolerated.
Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin.
There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in humans.
In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions observed with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for 10 days and 400 mg per day for periods of up to 28 days.
A large overdose of metformin (or co-existing risks of lactic acidosis) may lead to lactic acidosis which is a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital.
The most effective method to remove lactate and metformin is haemodialysis.
Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable.
In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session.
Prolonged haemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate.
It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis.
In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e. g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering drugs, ATC code:
A10BD07
Efficib combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: sitagliptin phosphate, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.
9 Sitagliptin Sitagliptin phosphate is an orally-active, potent, and highly selective inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) enzyme for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
The DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of agents that act as incretin enhancers.
By inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme, sitagliptin increases the levels of two known active incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).
The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis.
When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells.
GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production.
When blood glucose levels are low, insulin release is not enhanced and glucagon secretion is not suppressed.
Sitagliptin is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 and does not inhibit the closely-related enzymes DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations.
Sitagliptin differs in chemical structure and pharmacological action from GLP-1 analogues, insulin, sulphonylureas or meglitinides, biguanides, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists, alpha- glucosidase inhibitors, and amylin analogues.
Overall, sitagliptin improved glycaemic control when used in combination with metformin (as initial or add-on therapy) and in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin, as measured by clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at study endpoint (see Table 3).
In clinical trials, sitagliptin as monotherapy improved glycaemic control with significant reductions in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting and postprandial glucose.
Reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was observed at 3 weeks, the first time point at which FPG was measured.
The observed incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with sitagliptin was similar to placebo.
Body weight did not increase from baseline with sitagliptin therapy.
Improvements in surrogate markers of beta cell function, including HOMA-β (Homeostasis Model Assessment-β), proinsulin to insulin ratio, and measures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test were observed.
Studies of sitagliptin in combination with metformin In a 24-week, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily to ongoing metformin, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared with placebo.
Change from baseline in body weight was similar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to placebo.
In this study there was a similar incidence of hypoglycaemia reported for patients treated with sitagliptin or placebo.
In a 24-week placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy, sitagliptin 50 mg twice daily in combination with metformin (500 mg or 1000 mg twice daily) provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared with either monotherapy.
The decrease in body weight with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was similar to that observed with metformin alone or placebo; there was no change from baseline for patients on sitagliptin alone.
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.
Study of sitagliptin in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea A 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) added to glimepiride (alone or in combination with metformin).
The addition of sitagliptin to glimepiride and metformin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters.
Patients treated with sitagliptin had a modest increase in body weight (+1.1 kg) compared to those given placebo.

In a 52-week study, comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide (a sulphonylurea agent) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, sitagliptin was similar to glipizide in reducing HbA1c (-0.7% mean change from baselines at week 52, with baseline HbA1c of approximately 7.5% in both groups).
The mean glipizide dose used in the comparator group was 10 mg per day with approximately 40% of patients requiring a glipizide dose of ≤ 5 mg/ day throughout the study.
However, more patients in the sitagliptin group discontinued due to lack of efficacy than in the glipizide group.
Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight (-1.5 kg) compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (+1.1 kg).
In this study, the proinsulin to insulin ratio, a marker of efficiency of insulin synthesis and release, improved with sitagliptin and deteriorated with glipizide treatment.
The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9%) was significantly lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%).
Metformin Metformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose.
It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia.
Metformin may act via three mechanisms:
- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
- in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and
utilisation
- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption.
Metformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase.
Metformin increases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and GLUT-4).
In humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid metabolism.
This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term clinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDLc and triglyceride levels.
11 The prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes.
Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with metformin after failure of diet alone showed:
- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin
group (29.8 events/ 1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/ 1,000 patient-years), p=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups (40.1 events/ 1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034
- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality: metformin
7.5 events/ 1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/ 1,000 patient-years, p=0.017
- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin
13.5 events/ 1,000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/ 1,000 patient-years, (p=0.011), and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/ 1,000 patient-years (p=0.021)
- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin
11 events/ 1,000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/ 1,000 patient-years, (p=0.01).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Efficib A bioequivalence study in healthy subjects demonstrated that the Efficib (sitagliptin/ metformin hydrochloride) combination tablets are bioequivalent to co-administration of sitagliptin phosphate and metformin hydrochloride as individual tablets.
The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of Efficib.
Sitagliptin Absorption Following oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 μ M• hr, Cmax was 950 nM.
The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%.
Since co-administration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics, sitagliptin may be administered with or without food.
Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner.
Dose-proportionality was not established for Cmax and C24hr (Cmax increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner and C24hr increased in a less than dose-proportional manner).
Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 litres.
The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%).
Metabolism Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway.
Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
Following a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin.
Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin.
In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8.
In vitro data showed that sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isoenzymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.
12 Elimination Following administration of an oral [14C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing.
The apparent terminal t½ following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours.
Sitagliptin accumulates only minimally with multiple doses.
The renal clearance was approximately 350 ml/ min.
Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion.
Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin.
The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established.
Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin.
However, cyclosporine, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin.
Sitagliptin is not a substrate for OCT2 or OAT1 or PEPT1/ 2 transporters.
In vitro, sitagliptin did not inhibit OAT3 (IC50=160 μ M) or p-glycoprotein (up to 250 μ M) mediated transport at therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations.
In a clinical study sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations indicating that sitagliptin may be a mild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein.
Characteristics in patients The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Renal insufficiency A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a reduced dose of sitagliptin (50 mg) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal insufficiency compared to normal healthy control subjects.
The study included patients with renal insufficiency classified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (50 to < 80 ml/ min), moderate (30 to < 50 ml/ min), and severe (< 30 ml/ min), as well as patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis.
Patients with mild renal insufficiency did not have a clinically meaningful increase in the plasma concentration of sitagliptin as compared to normal healthy control subjects.
An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal insufficiency, and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal insufficiency and in patients with ESRD on haemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects.
Sitagliptin was modestly removed by haemodialysis (13.5% over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session starting 4 hours post-dose).
Sitagliptin is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency including those with ESRD since experience in these patients is too limited (see section 4.2).
Hepatic insufficiency No dose adjustment for sitagliptin is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score ≤ 9).
There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score > 9).
However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic insufficiency is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.
Elderly No dose adjustment is required based on age.
Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data.
Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.
Paediatric No studies with sitagliptin have been performed in paediatric patients.
Other patient characteristics No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, race, or body mass index (BMI).
These characteristics had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a 13 composite analysis of Phase I pharmacokinetic data and on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data.
Metformin Absorption After an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 h.
Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects.
After an oral dose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%.
After oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete.
It is assumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear.
At the usual metformin doses and dosing schedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than 1 µg/ ml.
In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed 4 µg/ ml, even at maximum doses.
Food decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin.
Following administration of a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC and a 35 min prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration was observed.
The clinical relevance of this decrease is unknown.
Distribution Plasma protein binding is negligible.
Metformin partitions into erythrocytes.
The blood peak is lower than the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time.
The red blood cells most likely represent a secondary compartment of distribution.
The mean Vd ranged between 63 – 276 l.
Metabolism Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
No metabolites have been identified in humans.
Elimination Renal clearance of metformin is > 400 ml/ min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.
Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 h.
When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin in plasma.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
No animal studies have been conducted with Efficib.
In 16-week studies in which dogs were treated with either metformin alone or a combination of metformin and sitagliptin, no additional toxicity was observed from the combination.
The NOEL in these studies was observed at exposures to sitagliptin of approximately 6 times the human exposure and to metformin of approximately 2.5 times the human exposure.
The following data are findings in studies performed with sitagliptin or metformin individually.
Sitagliptin Renal and liver toxicity were observed in rodents at systemic exposure values 58 times the human exposure level, while the no-effect level was found at 19 times the human exposure level.
Incisor teeth abnormalities were observed in rats at exposure levels 67 times the clinical exposure level; the no- effect level for this finding was 58-fold based on the 14-week rat study.
The relevance of these findings for humans is unknown.
Transient treatment-related physical signs, some of which suggest neural toxicity, such as open-mouth breathing, salivation, white foamy emesis, ataxia, trembling, decreased activity, and/ or hunched posture were observed in dogs at exposure levels approximately 23 times the clinical exposure level.
In addition, very slight to slight skeletal muscle degeneration was also observed histologically at doses resulting in systemic exposure levels of approximately 23 times
14 the human exposure level.
A no-effect level for these findings was found at an exposure 6-fold the clinical exposure level.
Sitagliptin has not been demonstrated to be genotoxic in preclinical studies.
Sitagliptin was not carcinogenic in mice.
In rats, there was an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas at systemic exposure levels 58 times the human exposure level.
Since hepatotoxicity has been shown to correlate with induction of hepatic neoplasia in rats, this increased incidence of hepatic tumors in rats was likely secondary to chronic hepatic toxicity at this high dose.
Because of the high safety margin (19-fold at this no-effect level), these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the situation in humans.
No treatment related effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin prior to and throughout mating.
In a pre-/ postnatal development study performed in rats sitagliptin showed no adverse effects.
Reproductive toxicity studies showed a slight treatment-related increased incidence of fetal rib malformations (absent, hypoplastic and wavy ribs) in the offspring of rats at systemic exposure levels more than 29 times the human exposure levels.
Maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits at more than 29 times the human exposure levels.
Because of the high safety margins, these findings do not suggest a relevant risk for human reproduction.
Sitagliptin is secreted in considerable amounts into the milk of lactating rats (milk/ plasma ratio:
4:1).
Metformin Preclinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus:
Efficib is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or those already being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin.
Efficib is also indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i. e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The dose of antihyperglycaemic therapy with Efficib should be individualised on the basis of the patient’ s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg sitagliptin.
For patients inadequately controlled on maximal tolerated dose of metformin monotherapy For patients not adequately controlled on metformin alone, the usual starting dose of Efficib should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) plus the dose of metformin already being taken.
For patients switching from co-administration of sitagliptin and metformin For patients switching from co-administration of sitagliptin and metformin, Efficib should be initiated at the dose of sitagliptin and metformin already being taken.
For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy with the maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea The dose of Efficib should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and a dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken.
When Efficib is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4).
17 For the different doses on metformin, Efficib is available in strengths of 50 mg sitagliptin and 850 mg metformin hydrochloride or 1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride.
All patients should continue their diet with an adequate distribution of carbohydrate intake during the day.
Overweight patients should continue their energy-restricted diet.
Efficib should be given twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal undesirable effects associated with metformin.
Patients with renal insufficiency Efficib should not be used in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Patients with hepatic insufficiency Efficib should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).
Elderly As metformin and sitagliptin are excreted by the kidney, Efficib should be used with caution as age increases.
Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Limited safety data on sitagliptin is available in patients > 75 years of age and care should be exercised.
Paediatric population Efficib is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on its safety and efficacy in this population.
4.3 Contraindications
Efficib is contraindicated in patients with:
- hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8);
- diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic pre-coma;
- moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min) (see section 4.4);
- acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function such as:
- - - -
dehydration, severe infection, shock, intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see section 4.4);
- acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia such as:
- - -
cardiac or respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction, shock;
- hepatic impairment;
- acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism;
- lactation.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Efficib should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes and must not be used for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Lactic acidosis Lactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious (high mortality in the absence of prompt treatment), metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation.
Reported cases of lactic acidosis in patients on metformin have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal failure.
The incidence of lactic acidosis can and should be reduced by also assessing other associated
18 risk factors such as poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency and any conditions associated with hypoxia.
Diagnosis Lactic acidosis is characterised by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain and hypothermia followed by coma.
Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH, plasma lactate levels above 5 mmol/ l, and an increased anion gap and lactate/ pyruvate ratio.
If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment with the medicinal product should be discontinued and the patient hospitalised immediately (see section 4.9).
Renal function Metformin and sitagliptin are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney.
Metformin-related lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function, therefore, serum creatinine concentrations should be determined regularly:
- at least once a year in patients with normal renal function
- at least two to four times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at or above the upper
limit of normal and in elderly patients.
Decreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic.
Special caution should be exercised in situations where renal function may become impaired, for example when initiating antihypertensive or diuretic therapy or when starting treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
Hypoglycaemia Patients receiving Efficib in combination with a sulphonylurea may be at risk for hypoglycaemia.
Therefore, a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea may be necessary.
The use of Efficib in combination with insulin has not been adequately studied.
Hypersensitivity reactions Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin have been reported.
These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose.
If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue Efficib, assess for other potential causes of the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes (see section 4.8).
Surgery As Efficib contains metformin hydrochloride, the treatment should be discontinued 48 hours before elective surgery with general, spinal or epidural anaesthesia.
Efficib should not usually be resumed earlier than 48 hours afterwards and only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal.
Administration of iodinated contrast agent The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies can lead to renal failure which has been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin.
Therefore, Efficib should be discontinued prior to, or at the time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal (see section 4.5).
19 Change in clinical status of patients with previously controlled type 2 diabetes A patient with type 2 diabetes previously well controlled on Efficib who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis.
Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate, pyruvate, and metformin levels.
If acidosis of either form occurs, Efficib must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Co-administration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg twice daily) and metformin (1,000 mg twice daily) did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with Efficib have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual active substances of Efficib, sitagliptin and metformin.
There is increased risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication (particularly in the case of fasting, malnutrition or hepatic insufficiency) due to the metformin active substance of Efficib (see section 4.4).
Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be avoided.
Cationic agents that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e. g., cimetidine) may interact with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems.
A study conducted in seven normal healthy volunteers showed that cimetidine, administered as 400 mg twice daily, increased metformin systemic exposure (AUC) by 50% and Cmax by 81%.
Therefore, close monitoring of glycaemic control, dose adjustment within the recommended posology and changes in diabetic treatment should be considered when cationic agents that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion are co-administered.
The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies may lead to renal failure, resulting in metformin accumulation and a risk of lactic acidosis.
Therefore, Efficib should be discontinued prior to, or at the time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal (see section 4.4).
Combination requiring precautions for use Glucocorticoids (given by systemic and local routes) beta-2-agonists, and diuretics have intrinsic hyperglycaemic activity.
The patient should be informed and more frequent blood glucose monitoring performed, especially at the beginning of treatment with such medicinal products.
If necessary, the dose of the anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation.
ACE-inhibitors may decrease the blood glucose levels.
If necessary, the dose of the antihyperglycaemic medicinal product should be adjusted during therapy with the other medicinal product and on its discontinuation.
Effects of other medicinal products on sitagliptin Clinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions following co- administration of other medicinal products is low.
Cyclosporine:
A study was conducted to assess the effect of cyclosporine, a potent inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.
Co-administration of a single 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin and a single 600 mg oral dose of cyclosporine increased the AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin by approximately 29% and 68%, respectively.
These changes in sitagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically meaningful.
The renal clearance of sitagliptin was not meaningfully altered.
Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p-glycoprotein inhibitors.
20 In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin is CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8.
In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, including via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin.
Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal insufficiency or ESRD.
For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i. e., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal insufficiency or ESRD.
The effects of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the setting of renal insufficiency has not been assessed in a clinical study.
In vitro transport studies showed that sitagliptin is a substrate for p-glycoprotein and OAT3.
OAT3 mediated transport of sitagliptin was inhibited in vitro by probenecid, although the risk of clinically meaningful interactions is considered to be low.
Concomitant administration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo.
Effects of sitagliptin on other medicinal products In vitro data suggest that sitagliptin does not inhibit nor induce CYP450 isoenzymes.
In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).
Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations, and may be a mild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein in vivo.
Digoxin:
Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations.
Following administration of 0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of sitagliptin daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of digoxin was increased on average by 11%, and the plasma Cmax on average by 18%.
No dose adjustment of digoxin is recommended.
However, patients at risk of digoxin toxicity should be monitored for this when sitagliptin and digoxin are administered concomitantly.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of sitagliptin in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at high doses of sitagliptin (see section 5.3).
A limited amount of data suggest the use of metformin in pregnant women is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations.
Animal studies with metformin do not indicate harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see also section 5.3).
Efficib should not be used during pregnancy.
If a patient wishes to become pregnant or if a pregnancy occurs, treatment with Efficib should be discontinued and switched to insulin treatment as soon as possible.
No studies in lactating animals have been conducted with the combined active substances of Efficib.
In studies performed with the individual active substances, both sitagliptin and metformin are excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Metformin is excreted in human milk in small amounts.
It is not known whether sitagliptin is excreted in human milk.
Efficib must therefore not be used in women who are breast-feeding (see section 4.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed with Efficib.
However, when driving or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and somnolence have been reported with sitagliptin.
In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when Efficib is used in combination with other sulfonylurea agents.
21 4.8 Undesirable effects
There have been no therapeutic clinical trials conducted with Efficib tablets however bioequivalence of Efficib with co-administered sitagliptin and metformin has been demonstrated (see section 5.2).
Sitagliptin and metformin Adverse reactions considered as drug related reported in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of placebo and in patients receiving sitagliptin in combination with metformin in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency (Table 1).
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).

Very common
In clinical trials of sitagliptin as monotherapy and sitagliptin as part of combination therapy with metformin, rates of hypoglycaemia reported with sitagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo.
1 In this placebo-controlled 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to treatment with placebo added to ongoing metformin was 9.3% and 10.1%, respectively.
In an additional 1-year study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin compared to sulphonylurea added to ongoing metformin was 14.5% and 30.3%, respectively.
In pooled studies of up to 1 year in duration comparing sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin to a sulphonylurea agent added to ongoing metformin, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg occurring in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving the sulphonylurea agent are as follows: anorexia (Metabolism and nutritional disorders; frequency uncommon) and weight decreased (Investigations; frequency uncommon).
2 In this 24-week placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily added to ongoing combination treatment with glimepiride and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the addition of sitagliptin to the ongoing treatment
22 with glimepiride and metformin was 18.1% compared to treatment with the addition of placebo to the ongoing treatment with glimepiride and metformin which was 7.1%.
In a 24-week study of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin administered twice daily (sitagliptin/ metformin 50 mg/ 500 mg or 50 mg/ 1,000 mg), the overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin compared to patients treated with placebo was 14.0% and 9.7%, respectively.
The overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was comparable to metformin alone (14.0% each) and greater than sitagliptin alone (6.7%), with the differences relative to sitagliptin alone primarily due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
Additional information on the individual active substances of the fixed dose combination Sitagliptin In addition, in monotherapy studies of up to 24 weeks in duration of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily alone compared to placebo, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving placebo are headache, hypoglycaemia, constipation, and dizziness.
In addition to the drug related adverse reactions described above, adverse events (reported regardless of causal relationship to medicinal product) occurring in at least 5% and more commonly in patients treated with sitagliptin included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis.
Additional adverse events that occurred more frequently in patients treated with sitagliptin (not reaching the 5% level, but occurring with an incidence of > 0.5% higher with sitagliptin than that in the control group) included osteoarthritis and pain in extremity.
Across clinical studies, a small increase in white blood cell (WBC) count (approximately 200 cells/ microl difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6,600 cells/ microl) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils.
This observation was seen in most but not all studies.
This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant.
No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed with sitagliptin treatment.
Post-marketing data
During post-marketing experience of Efficib or sitagliptin, one of the active substances of Efficib, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported (frequency not known): hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (see section 4.4).

Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain occur most frequently during initiation of therapy and resolve spontaneously in b
and loss of appetite most cases.
Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption which may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e. g., megaloblastic anaemia).
4.9 Overdose
No data are available with regard to overdose of Efficib.
During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were generally well tolerated.
Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin.
There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in humans.
In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions observed with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for 10 days and 400 mg per day for periods of up to 28 days.
A large overdose of metformin (or co-existing risks of lactic acidosis) may lead to lactic acidosis which is a medical emergency and must be treated in hospital.
The most effective method to remove lactate and metformin is haemodialysis.
Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable.
In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session.
Prolonged haemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate.
It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis.
In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e. g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering drugs, ATC code:
A10BD07
Efficib combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: sitagliptin phosphate, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class.
24 Sitagliptin Sitagliptin phosphate is an orally-active, potent, and highly selective inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) enzyme for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
The DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of agents that act as incretin enhancers.
By inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme, sitagliptin increases the levels of two known active incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).
The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis.
When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells.
GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production.
When blood glucose levels are low, insulin release is not enhanced and glucagon secretion is not suppressed.
Sitagliptin is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 and does not inhibit the closely-related enzymes DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations.
Sitagliptin differs in chemical structure and pharmacological action from GLP-1 analogues, insulin, sulphonylureas or meglitinides, biguanides, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists, alpha- glucosidase inhibitors, and amylin analogues.
Overall, sitagliptin improved glycaemic control when used in combination with metformin (as initial or add-on therapy) and in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin, as measured by clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at study endpoint (see Table 3).
In clinical trials, sitagliptin as monotherapy improved glycaemic control with significant reductions in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting and postprandial glucose.
Reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was observed at 3 weeks, the first time point at which FPG was measured.
The observed incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with sitagliptin was similar to placebo.
Body weight did not increase from baseline with sitagliptin therapy.
Improvements in surrogate markers of beta cell function, including HOMA-β (Homeostasis Model Assessment-β), proinsulin to insulin ratio, and measures of beta cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test were observed.
Studies of sitagliptin in combination with metformin In a 24-week, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily to ongoing metformin, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared with placebo.
Change from baseline in body weight was similar for patients treated with sitagliptin relative to placebo.
In this study there was a similar incidence of hypoglycaemia reported for patients treated with sitagliptin or placebo.
In a 24-week placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy, sitagliptin 50 mg twice daily in combination with metformin (500 mg or 1000 mg twice daily) provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters compared with either monotherapy.
The decrease in body weight with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was similar to that observed with metformin alone or placebo; there was no change from baseline for patients on sitagliptin alone.
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.
Study of sitagliptin in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea A 24-week placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) added to glimepiride (alone or in combination with metformin).
The addition of sitagliptin to glimepiride and metformin provided significant improvements in glycaemic parameters.
Patients treated with sitagliptin had a modest increase in body weight (+1.1 kg) compared to those given placebo.

In a 52-week study, comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide (a sulphonylurea agent) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, sitagliptin was similar to glipizide in reducing HbA1c (-0.7% mean change from baselines at week 52, with baseline HbA1c of approximately 7.5% in both groups).
The mean glipizide dose used in the comparator group was 10 mg per day with approximately 40% of patients requiring a glipizide dose of ≤ 5 mg/ day throughout the study.
However, more patients in the sitagliptin group discontinued due to lack of efficacy than in the glipizide group.
Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight (-1.5 kg) compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (+1.1 kg).
In this study, the proinsulin to insulin ratio, a marker of efficiency of insulin synthesis and release, improved with sitagliptin and deteriorated with glipizide treatment.
The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9%) was significantly lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%).
Metformin Metformin is a biguanide with antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose.
It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not produce hypoglycaemia.
Metformin may act via three mechanisms:
- by reduction of hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
- in muscle, by modestly increasing insulin sensitivity, improving peripheral glucose uptake and
utilisation
- by delaying intestinal glucose absorption
Metformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase.
Metformin increases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and GLUT-4).
In humans, independently of its action on glycaemia, metformin has favourable effects on lipid metabolism.
This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term clinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDLc and triglyceride levels.
26 The prospective randomised (UKPDS) study has established the long-term benefit of intensive blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes.
Analysis of the results for overweight patients treated with metformin after failure of diet alone showed:
- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related complication in the metformin
group (29.8 events/ 1,000 patient-years) versus diet alone (43.3 events/ 1,000 patient-years), p=0.0023, and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups (40.1 events/ 1,000 patient-years), p=0.0034
- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of any diabetes-related mortality: metformin
7.5 events/ 1,000 patient-years, diet alone 12.7 events/ 1,000 patient-years, p=0.017
- a significant reduction of the absolute risk of overall mortality: metformin
13.5 events/ 1,000 patient-years versus diet alone 20.6 events/ 1,000 patient-years, (p=0.011), and versus the combined sulphonylurea and insulin monotherapy groups 18.9 events/ 1,000 patient-years (p=0.021)
- a significant reduction in the absolute risk of myocardial infarction: metformin
11 events/ 1,000 patient-years, diet alone 18 events/ 1,000 patient-years, (p=0.01).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Efficib A bioequivalence study in healthy subjects demonstrated that the Efficib (sitagliptin/ metformin hydrochloride) combination tablets are bioequivalent to co-administration of sitagliptin phosphate and metformin hydrochloride as individual tablets.
The following statements reflect the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual active substances of Efficib.
Sitagliptin Absorption Following oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours post-dose, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 μ M• hr, Cmax was 950 nM.
The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%.
Since co-administration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics, sitagliptin may be administered with or without food.
Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner.
Dose-proportionality was not established for Cmax and C24hr (Cmax increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner and C24hr increased in a less than dose-proportional manner).
Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 litres.
The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%).
Metabolism Sitagliptin is primarily eliminated unchanged in urine, and metabolism is a minor pathway.
Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
Following a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin.
Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin.
In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8.
In vitro data showed that sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isoenzymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.
27 Elimination Following administration of an oral [14C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing.
The apparent terminal t½ following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours.
Sitagliptin accumulates only minimally with multiple doses.
The renal clearance was approximately 350 ml/ min.
Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion.
Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin.
The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established.
Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin.
However, cyclosporine, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin.
Sitagliptin is not a substrate for OCT2 or OAT1 or PEPT1/ 2 transporters.
In vitro, sitagliptin did not inhibit OAT3 (IC50=160 μ M) or p-glycoprotein (up to 250 μ M) mediated transport at therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations.
In a clinical study sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations indicating that sitagliptin may be a mild inhibitor of p-glycoprotein.
Characteristics in patients The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin were generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Renal insufficiency A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a reduced dose of sitagliptin (50 mg) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal insufficiency compared to normal healthy control subjects.
The study included patients with renal insufficiency classified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (50 to < 80 ml/ min), moderate (30 to < 50 ml/ min), and severe (< 30 ml/ min), as well as patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis.
Patients with mild renal insufficiency did not have a clinically meaningful increase in the plasma concentration of sitagliptin as compared to normal healthy control subjects.
An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal insufficiency, and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal insufficiency and in patients with ESRD on haemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects.
Sitagliptin was modestly removed by haemodialysis (13.5% over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session starting 4 hours post-dose).
Sitagliptin is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency including those with ESRD since experience in these patients is too limited (see section 4.2).
Hepatic insufficiency No dose adjustment for sitagliptin is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score ≤ 9).
There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score > 9).
However, because sitagliptin is primarily renally eliminated, severe hepatic insufficiency is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.
Elderly No dose adjustment is required based on age.
Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data.
Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.
Paediatric No studies with sitagliptin have been performed in paediatric patients.
Other patient characteristics No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender, race, or body mass index (BMI).
These characteristics had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a 28 composite analysis of Phase I pharmacokinetic data and on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data.
Metformin Absorption After an oral dose of metformin, tmax is reached in 2.5 h.
Absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin tablet is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects.
After an oral dose, the non-absorbed fraction recovered in faeces was 20-30%.
After oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete.
It is assumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear.
At the usual metformin doses and dosing schedules, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 h and are generally less than 1 µg/ ml.
In controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels (Cmax) did not exceed 4 µg/ ml, even at maximum doses.
Food decreases the extent and slightly delays the absorption of metformin.
Following administration of a dose of 850 mg, a 40% lower plasma peak concentration, a 25% decrease in AUC and a 35 min prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration was observed.
The clinical relevance of this decrease is unknown.
Distribution Plasma protein binding is negligible.
Metformin partitions into erythrocytes.
The blood peak is lower than the plasma peak and appears at approximately the same time.
The red blood cells most likely represent a secondary compartment of distribution.
The mean Vd ranged between 63 – 276 l.
Metabolism Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
No metabolites have been identified in humans.
Elimination Renal clearance of metformin is > 400 ml/ min, indicating that metformin is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.
Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 h.
When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin in plasma.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
No animal studies have been conducted with Efficib.
In 16-week studies in which dogs were treated with either metformin alone or a combination of metformin and sitagliptin, no additional toxicity was observed from the combination.
The NOEL in these studies was observed at exposures to sitagliptin of approximately 6 times the human exposure and to metformin of approximately 2.5 times the human exposure.
The following data are findings in studies performed with sitagliptin or metformin individually.
Sitagliptin Renal and liver toxicity were observed in rodents at systemic exposure values 58 times the human exposure level, while the no-effect level was found at 19 times the human exposure level.
Incisor teeth abnormalities were observed in rats at exposure levels 67 times the clinical exposure level; the no- effect level for this finding was 58-fold based on the 14-week rat study.
The relevance of these findings for humans is unknown.
Transient treatment-related physical signs, some of which suggest neural toxicity, such as open-mouth breathing, salivation, white foamy emesis, ataxia, trembling, decreased activity, and/ or hunched posture were observed in dogs at exposure levels approximately 23 times the clinical exposure level.
In addition, very slight to slight skeletal muscle degeneration was also observed histologically at doses resulting in systemic exposure levels of approximately 23 times
29 the human exposure level.
A no-effect level for these findings was found at an exposure 6-fold the clinical exposure level.
Sitagliptin has not been demonstrated to be genotoxic in preclinical studies.
Sitagliptin was not carcinogenic in mice.
In rats, there was an increased incidence of hepatic adenomas and carcinomas at systemic exposure levels 58 times the human exposure level.
Since hepatotoxicity has been shown to correlate with induction of hepatic neoplasia in rats, this increased incidence of hepatic tumors in rats was likely secondary to chronic hepatic toxicity at this high dose.
Because of the high safety margin (19-fold at this no-effect level), these neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the situation in humans.
No treatment related effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given sitagliptin prior to and throughout mating.
In a pre-/ postnatal development study performed in rats sitagliptin showed no adverse effects.
Reproductive toxicity studies showed a slight treatment-related increased incidence of fetal rib malformations (absent, hypoplastic and wavy ribs) in the offspring of rats at systemic exposure levels more than 29 times the human exposure levels.
Maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits at more than 29 times the human exposure levels.
Because of the high safety margins, these findings do not suggest a relevant risk for human reproduction.
Sitagliptin is secreted in considerable amounts into the milk of lactating rats (milk/ plasma ratio:
4:1).
Metformin Preclinical data for metformin reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.

1.
WHAT EFFICIB IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
The name of your tablet is Efficib.
It contains two different medicines called sitagliptin and metformin. • sitagliptin belongs to a class of medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors) • metformin belongs to a class of medicines called biguanides.
They work together to control blood sugar levels in patients with a form of diabetes called ‘ type 2 diabetes mellitus’.
Efficib helps to improve the levels of insulin after a meal and lowers the amount of sugar made by your body.
Along with diet and exercise, this medicine helps lower your blood sugar.
Efficib can be used alone or with another medicine for diabetes called a sulphonylurea.
What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or NIDDM.
Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should.
Your body can also make too much sugar.
When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood.
This can lead to serious medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and amputation.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE EFFICIB
Do not take Efficib:
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to sitagliptin or metformin or any of the other ingredients of
Efficib (listed in section 6)
- if you have diabetic ketoacidosis (a complication of diabetes with rapid weight loss, nausea or
vomiting) or have had a diabetic coma
- if you have problems with your kidneys
- if you have a severe infection or are dehydrated
47
- if you are going to have an X-ray where you will be injected with a dye.
You will need to stop
taking Efficib at the time of the X-ray and for a few days after
- if you have recently had a heart attack or have severe circulatory problems, such as ‘ shock’ or
breathing difficulties
- if you have liver problems
- if you drink alcohol to excess (either every day or only from time to time)
- if you are breast-feeding
Do not take Efficib if any of the above apply to you.
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Efficib.
Take special care with Efficib Check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking your medicine:
- if you have type 1 diabetes.
This is sometimes called insulin-dependent diabetes
- if you experience some of the following symptoms: feeling cold or uncomfortable, severe
nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, muscular cramps, or rapid breathing.
Metformin hydrochloride, one of the ingredients in Efficib, can cause a rare but serious side effect called lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the blood) that can cause death.
Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in a hospital.
If you experience some of the symptoms of lactic acidosis stop taking Efficib and consult a doctor immediately
- During treatment with Efficib, your doctor will check your kidney function at least once a year
and more frequently if you are elderly or if your kidney function is borderline or at risk of worsening
- if you have or have had an allergic reaction to sitagliptin, metformin, or Efficib
- if you are taking a sulphonylurea, a diabetes medicine, together with Efficib, as you may
experience low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia).
Your doctor may reduce the dose of your sulphonylurea
- if you are going to have an operation under general, spinal or epidural anaesthetic.
You may
need to stop taking Efficib for a couple of days before and after the procedure
- if you are under 18 years of age
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Efficib.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.
This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines.
The following medicines are particularly important: • medicines used to treat diseases that involve inflammation, like asthma and arthritis (corticosteroids) • specific medicines for the treatment of high blood pressure (ACE inhibitors) • medicines which increase urine production (diuretics) • specific medicines for the treatment of bronchial asthma (β -sympathomimetics) • iodinated contrast agents or alcohol-containing medicines.
Taking Efficib with food and drink Take Efficib with meals to lower your chance of an upset stomach.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should talk to their doctor before taking Efficib.
You should not use Efficib during pregnancy.
48 Metformin passes into human milk in small amounts.
It is not known whether sitagliptin passes into human milk.
It is not known if Efficib passes into human breast milk.
You must not use Efficib if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed.
Driving and using machines No studies on the effects of Efficib on the ability to drive or to use machines have been performed.
However, when driving or operating machinery, it should be taken into account that dizziness and drowsiness have been reported with sitagliptin.

3.
HOW TO TAKE EFFICIB
Always take Efficib exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
• Efficib should be taken:
• •
twice daily by mouth with meals to lower your chance of an upset stomach.
• Your doctor may need to increase your dose to control your blood sugar.

Sometimes you may need to stop taking your medicine for a short time.
Talk to your doctor for instructions if you:
• have a condition that may be associated with dehydration (large loss of body fluids) such as being sick with severe vomiting, diarrhoea or fever, or if you drink fluids a lot less than normal • plan to have surgery • are due to get an injection of dye or contrast agent as part of an X-ray
If you take more Efficib than you should If you take more than the prescribed dosage of Efficib, contact your doctor immediately.
If you forget to take Efficib If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.
If you do not remember until it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule.
