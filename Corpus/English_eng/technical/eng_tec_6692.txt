Deletes the job. If it is currently speaking, it stops speaking. The next speakable job in the list begins speaking.
Changes a job to Paused state. If currently speaking, the job stops speaking. Paused jobs prevent jobs that follow them from speaking, so either click Resume to make the job speakable, or click Later to move it down in the list.
Pause
Resumes a paused job or changes a Queued job to Waiting. If the job is the top speakable job in the list, it begins speaking.
Resume
Queues the current contents of the clipboard for speaking and sets its state to Waiting. If the job is the topmost in the list, it begins speaking. The job will be spoken by the topmost Talker in the Talkers tab.
& Speak Clipboard
Prompts you for a file name and queues the contents of the file for speaking. You must click the Resume button before the job will be speakable. The job will be spoken by the topmost Talker in the Talkers tab.
Speak File
Prompts you with a list of your configured Talkers from the Talkers tab. The job will be spoken using the selected Talker.

These are all the text jobs. The State column may be: Queued - the job is waiting and will not be spoken until its state is changed to Waiting by clicking the Resume or Restart buttons. Waiting - the job is ready to be spoken. It will be spoken when the jobs preceding it in the list have finished. Speaking - the job is speaking. The Position column shows the current sentence of the job being spoken. You may pause a speaking job by clicking the Hold button. Paused - the job is currently paused. Paused jobs prevent jobs below them from speaking. Use the Resume or Restart buttons to resume speaking the job, or click Later to move the job down in the list. Finished - the job has finished speaking. When a second job finishes, this one will be deleted. You may click Restart to repeat the job. Note: Messages, Warnings, and Screen Reader Output do not appear in this list. See the Handbook for more information.
