EASTERSUNDAY function
EASTERSUNDAY
Returns the date of Easter Sunday for the entered year.
Syntax:
EASTERSUNDAY(Year)
Year
is an integer between 1583 and 9956 or 0 and 99.
You can also calculate other holidays by simple addition with this date.
Easter Monday = EASTERSUNDAY(Year) + 1
Good Friday = EASTERSUNDAY(Year) - 2
Pentecost Sunday = EASTERSUNDAY(Year) + 49
Pentecost Monday = EASTERSUNDAY(Year) + 50
Examples:
=EASTERSUNDAY(2000) returns 23/04/2000.
=EASTERSUNDAY(2000)+49 returns the internal serial number 36688, corresponding to 11/06/2000.
Format the serial date number as a date: for example, the format YYYY-MM-DD yields 2000-06-11.
