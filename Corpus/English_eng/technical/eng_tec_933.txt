Setting up Printer, Fax and Fonts Under UNIX Based Platforms
spadmin
is provided to help you set up printers, faxes and fonts for use with the $[officename] software.
spadmin
as follows:
Change to the {install_path}/program directory.
Enter: ./spadmin
spadmin
appears.
spadmin
.
The administrator then creates a general printer configuration file called {install_path}/share/psprint/psprint.conf for all users.
All changes are immediately available to all users.
The system administrator can also add fonts for all users in the server installation.
However, these fonts are available only after restarting the $[officename] software.
Setting up Printers
Printer Drivers in the $[officename] Software
.
The $[officename] software automatically provides a printer with the default driver for each system queue.
You can add additional printers as needed.
Adding a Printer

Printer Drivers in the $[officename] Software
When installing a non-PostScript printer, you must set your system so that PostScript can be converted into the language of the printer.
We recommend using current PostScript conversion software such as Ghostscript (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/).
Generic Printer
in that case.
Also make sure that the page margins are set correctly.
If you are using a printer using the PostScript technology, you should install a description file for the printer (PostScript Printer Definition - PPD) so that you can utilise the specific printer features like paper tray selection, duplex print function and all built-in fonts.
You can also use the generic printer driver since it contains the most important data and is suitable for most printers.
In that case, you will have to do without the paper tray selection and must correctly set the page margins.
Some PPD files are installed as default files.
If there is no matching PPD file for your printer, you will find various PPD files at http://www.adobe.com/products/printerdrivers/.
You can also ask the manufacturer of your printer for PPD files.
Importing Drivers When Creating a New Printer
Import
in the driver selection dialogue box.
Browse
to select the directory in which you unpacked the PPD files.
Selection of drivers
list box, select the printer driver you want to install.
Click OK.
Deleting Drivers When Creating a New Printer
Select the printer driver.
Delete
.
Be sure that you do not delete the generic printer driver, and remember that drivers deleted from server installations are no longer available to other users who are using the same server installation.
If the printer has more fonts built in than the usual PostScript fonts, you must also load the AFM files for these additional fonts.
Copy the AFM files into the {install_path}/share/psprint/fontmetric directory or into the {install_path}/user/psprint/fontmetric directory.
You can find AFM files, for example, at ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/type/win/all/afmfiles/.
Changing Printer Settings
spadmin
, select the printer from the
Installed printers
list box and click
Properties
.
The
Properties
dialogue box appears containing several tab pages.
This is where you can make settings that are used according to the PPD file of the selected printer.
Command
tab page.
You can remove superfluous commands using the
Remove
button.
Paper
tab page, you can define the paper format and paper tray to be used as the default settings for this printer.
Device
tab page, you can activate the special options for your printer.
If your printer can only print in black and white, choose &quot; greyscale &quot; under
Colour
, otherwise choose &quot; colour &quot; .
If switching to greyscale leads to unfavourable results, you can also select &quot; colour &quot; under
Colour
and see how the printer or PostScript emulator applies it.
Furthermore, on this tab page you can set the precision with which colours are described as well as the PostScript level.
Font Replacement
tab page allows you to select a printer font type available in the printer for each font type installed on your computer.
This way you can reduce the data volume sent to the printer.
Font replacement can be turned on or off for each printer individually.

Enter an appropriate name in the dialogue box that appears and click OK.
The name must be unique and should be chosen so that you can recognise the printer and the application.
Printer names must be assigned the same for all users because, when documents are exchanged, the selected printer remains unchanged if the recipient has it under the same name.
Remove
.
The default printer or a printer that has been created by the system administrator in a server installation cannot be removed using this dialogue box.
Selecting a Default Printer
Installed printers
list box the default printer, double-click its name or click the
Default

Using Fax Functionality
If you have installed a fax package such as Efax or HylaFax on your computer, you can send faxes with the $[officename] software.
Change to the {install_path}/program directory.
Enter: ./spadmin
New Printer
.
This opens the
Add Printer
dialogue box.
Connect a fax device
.
Click
Next
.
Next
.
Next

You can now send faxes by printing to the printer that has just been created.
Enter the fax number as text in the document.
You can also enter a field that takes the fax number from your active database.
In any case, the fax number must start with the characters @@# and end with @@.
A valid entry would have the form @@#1234567@@.
Fax number is removed from the printout
option under
Properties
on the
Command
tab page.
If no telephone number is entered in the document, a dialogue box prompting you for it will appear after the printout.

Connecting a PostScript to PDF Converter
If a PostScript to PDF converter such as Ghostscript or Adobe Acrobat Distiller is installed on your computer, you can quickly create PDF documents in the $[officename] software.

This opens the
Add Printer
dialogue box.
Connect a PDF converter

Finish
.
You can now create PDF documents by printing to the converter that has just been created.
Installing Fonts
When you are working with the $[officename] software you might notice that a different number of fonts is provided depending on the document type being used.
This is because not all of the fonts can be used in every case.
Therefore, only those fonts will be shown in the font selection box when working with a text document which can also be printed, as it is assumed that you will only want to use those fonts that you can actually have printed on paper.
In an HTML document or in Web layout, only fonts that are available on screen are offered.
On the other hand, when working with spreadsheets and drawings you will be able to use all of the fonts that can be either printed or shown on the screen.
Format - Character
.
Adding Fonts
You can integrate additional fonts in the $[officename] software.
Fonts which you integrate are available exclusively to the $[officename] software and can be used with various Xservers without your having to install them there.
To make the fonts available to other programs as well, proceed as usual by adding the fonts to your Xserver.
The $[officename] software can display and print out PostScript Type1 fonts as well as TrueType fonts (including TrueType Collections).
To integrate additional fonts in the $[officename] software, proceed as follows:
Go to the {install_path}/program directory.
Enter: ./spadmin
Fonts
.
Remove
button or add new fonts with the
Add
button.
Add
.
The
Add Fonts
dialogue box appears.
...
button and select the directory from the path selection dialogue box or enter the directory directly.
Select All
.
Create soft links only
check box you can determine whether the fonts are to be copied into the $[officename] directory or only symbolic links are to be created there.
If the fonts to be added are on a data medium that is not always available (such as a CD-ROM), you must copy the fonts.
Click OK.
The fonts will now be added.
In the case of a server installation, the fonts are installed in that installation if possible.
If the user has no write access rights, the fonts will be installed in the corresponding user installation so that only the user who installed them can access them.
Deleting Fonts
To delete fonts, proceed as follows:
Start spadmin.
Fonts
.
Delete
.
You can delete only the fonts that have been added for the $[officename] software.
Renaming Fonts
You can also rename fonts added for the $[officename] software.
This is especially useful for fonts that contain several localised names.
Start spadmin.
Fonts
.
Rename
.
Enter a new name in the dialogue box that appears.
If the font contains several names, these names will serve as suggestions in the combo box where you enter the new name.
Click OK.
If you select several fonts to rename, one dialogue box appears for each selected font.
If you have selected a TrueType Collection (TTC), one dialogue box appears for each of the fonts contained in it.
