When you draw a connector between shapes, the connector will be attached to a glue point on each shape.
Each shape has some default glue points, and the positions of the default glue points depend on the specific shape.
You can add your own custom glue points to a shape and then attach connectors to the custom glue points.
To add and edit glue points
Do one of the following:
Glue Point

Edit - Glue Points

Insert Glue Point
icon on the Glue points toolbar.
Click inside the shape where you want to add the new glue point.
If the shape is filled, you can click anywhere inside the shape.
If the shape is unfilled, you can click the border to insert a glue point.
Once inserted, you can drag the glue point to another position inside the shape.
Insert Glue Point
icon, you choose the directions which will be permitted for a connector at this glue point.
You can choose one or more directions for a particular glue point.
