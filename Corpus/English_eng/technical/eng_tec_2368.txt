(PHP 4)
array_push() treats array as a stack, and pushes the passed variables onto the end of array.
The length of array increases by the number of variables pushed.
Has the same effect as:
$array[] = $var;
Returns the new number of elements in the array.
Example 1. array_push() example
$stack = array ("orange", "banana"); array_push ($stack, "apple", "raspberry");
This example would result in $stack having the following elements:
Array ([0] = orange [1] = banana [2] = apple [3] = raspberry)
See also array_pop(), array_shift(), and array_unshift().
