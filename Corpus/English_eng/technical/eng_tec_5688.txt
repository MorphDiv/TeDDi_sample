Introduction
& kbruch; is a small program to practice calculating with fractions and percentages. Five different exercises are offered as well as a learning mode.
Arithmetic - in this exercise you have to solve a given fraction task. You have to enter the numerator and the denominator. This is the main exercise.
Comparison - in this exercise you have to compare the size of 2 given fractions, using the symbols gt;, lt; or =.
Conversion - in this exercise you have to convert a given number into a fraction.
Factorization - in this exercise you have to factorize a given number into its prime factors.
Percentage - in this exercise you have to calculate percentages.
In each different exercise & kbruch; will generate a task and the user has to solve it. The program checks the input and gives a feedback about it.
& kbruch; counts how many tasks were solved at all and how many tasks were solved correctly. The statistics are shown to the user.
& kbruch; is very compact and focuses on the core idea of a task generator. An online help system provides context-sensitive help for the different situations.
Using & kbruch;
Choosing the mode: learning or exercises
When you start & kbruch;, it offers you two modes: Freestyle which is the training mode and Learning where you can understand fractions. Clicking one of the pictures will enter the chosen mode. Here is a screenshot of & kbruch; 's mode choices:

Click one of the picture to choose the mode.
Main freestyle screen
Here is a screenshot of & kbruch; 's main freestyle screen:
& kbruch; main screen, directly after the freestyle start
& kbruch; main screen
All exercises take place in this screen. This ensures that & kbruch; is easy to use even for young users! The main screen is separated into 5 parts: the menubar with the 3 menus File, Settings and Help the toolbar, where you can switch between the different exercises the Options on the left, where you can define the difficulty and various settings for the tasks the task part, where you have to enter the result of the given task the statistical part, where you can see how many tasks have been solved correctly or attempted At any time, you can go back to Modes using the Back icon in the toolbar.
You can hide the Options section by dragging it to the left.
First you have to choose an exercise in the toolbar. Default is Arithmetic. The task part will change according to the chosen task. Some settings in the Options section will be enabled, depending on the task you have chosen.
You will find an icon to generate a new task in the toolbar as well. This action is also available in the menu File New. This action is always enabled. If you have not solved the currently given task, a new task is generated and the statistics are set back.
If you terminate & kbruch; the currently chosen exercise will be saved and restored on next startup.
Statistical Part

In this part of the main screen you can see:
on the left, how many tasks have been solved
on the right, in green, how many tasks have been solved correctly
on the right, in red, how many tasks have been solved incorrectly
on the right, in orange, how many tasks have been skipped
You can reset the statistics by clicking on the New button in the toolbar or choosing File New in the menubar.
The statistics will be saved when & kbruch; is closed and restored on next startup.
Configuring & kbruch; appearance
In this dialog you can adjust some general settings for the task display. To open this dialog use Settings Configure & kbruch;.
kbruch; settings dialog
kbruch; settings dialog
There are two tabs to adjust the setting:
Colors: Choose the colors for the different parts of a mathematical expression: numbers, operational sign, fraction bar.
Fonts: Choose a font for displaying the task.
The settings will be saved on & kbruch; 's termination and restored on the next startup.

Exercises
Exercise Arithmetic
In this exercise you have to solve a given task. Therefore you have to enter the integer part of a fraction and the numerator and the denominator. The difficulty of the generated task can be adjusted by using some options on the left.
Options
There are several parameters which influence the difficulty of the generated tasks:
Question
Mixed number
Set if the fractions will appear as mixed numbers or not in the question expression (mixed number example: 1 4/ 5 = 9/ 5).
Number of terms
The number of terms (separate fractions) given in each task. From 2 to 5, inclusive.
Maximum denominator
The highest number & kbruch; will use as the main denominator in the tasks it sets. From a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 50.
Answer
Set if the fractions will appear as mixed numbers or not in the answer (mixed number example: 1 4/ 5 = 9/ 5).
Reduced Form
Check this to force the use of the reduced form.
Solution
Set if the fractions will appear as mixed numbers or not in the solution (mixed number example: 1 4/ 5 = 9/ 5).
Operations
Operations which should be used in the task: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication or Division. Check all operations you want to use.
After you have changed the parameters you have to click on the New button in the toolbar to generate a task which uses the new parameters. You can also call this action from the menubar with Task New. This will reset the statistics. To avoid that, click the Next button to proceed with the changed parameters.
The chosen parameters will be saved on & kbruch; 's termination and restored on next startup.
Solving Tasks
After you have solved a given task, you need to enter the result into the three input boxes. In the left box you enter the integer part of the fraction, in the upper box the numerator and in the lower box the denominator. If the option Mixed number in the Answer section is unchecked, the left box for the integer part of the fraction is hidden. Then you use only the numerator box and the denominator box for your input.
If the result is negative, you can enter a minus sign in front of the numerator or denominator. If the result is 0, just type a 0 in the numerator input field. If the result has a denominator of 1, you can leave the lower box empty.
After you have entered the result you should click the Check button below the input boxes. & kbruch; will check your input and present the correct result on the right below the Incorrect! string:
Checked Task
Checked Task
This task was solved incorrectly. The correct value is shown in 2 different forms: normal (reduced) and mixed number.
If you checked the Reduced form in the Options in the Answers section then you always have to enter the result reduced. & kbruch; will show you a short message like the one in the screenshot below, if you enter the correct result unreduced. The answer will then be counted as incorrect.
Unreduced Result
Unreduced Result
To continue with the next task, click on the Next button. If you want to change the parameters for the next task please do this before clicking on the Next button.
Exercise Comparison
In this exercise you have to compare 2 given fractions. You have to choose the bigger fraction of both by selecting the correct comparison sign.
Exercise Comparison
Exercise Comparison
First choose the correct comparison sign. After you have chosen the comparison sign, the result will show on the right. A green square with Correct will tell you that your answer was correct while a red square with Incorrect will indicate that your answer was wrong. You will get to the next task by clicking the Next button.
In this exercise only the option Mixed number is enabled. If checked the fractions will appear as mixed numbers.
Exercise Conversion
In this exercise you have to convert a given number into a fraction. You have to enter numerator and denominator.
Exercise Conversion
Exercise Conversion
On the left side of the equal sign in the screenshot above you can see a recurring decimal. This means, that the fraction shown as a decimal has a repeating part. The repeating part is marked with the small bar above the numbers. Those numbers repeat ad infinitum.
After you have entered the numerator and denominator click on the Check button. & kbruch; will check your input and present the correct result. After this step you will get to the next task by clicking on the Next button.
Do not forget to enter the result reduced. Unreduced results will be counted as solved not correctly.
In this exercise all options are disabled.
Exercise Factorization
In this exercise you have to factorize a given number into its prime factors. You have to enter all prime factors of the number.
Exercise Factorization
Exercise Factorization
You can enter a factor by clicking on the prime factor buttons. The * sign is automatically inserted, when you click the next prime factor button. You can remove the last entered prime factor by clicking on the Backspace button.
After you have entered all prime factors click on the Check button. & kbruch; will check your input and present the correct result. After this step you will get to the next task by clicking on the Next button.
In the screenshot at the top of this page you can see a * between the prime factors. This is the multiplication sign. The product of all prime factors must be the number you try to factorize.
You have to enter all prime factors even when a prime factor repeats several times. Example: As prime factors of number 18 you have to enter 2, 3 and 3.
Exercise Percentage
In this exercise you have to answer some percentage questions.
Exercise Percentage
Exercise Percentage
After you have entered your answer click on the Check button. & kbruch; will check your input and present the correct result. After this step you will get to the next task by clicking on the Next button.

Exercise Fraction Task
Terms
If you have not solved the current task and call the New action, the task will be counted as not solved correctly. To prevent this you have to change the parameters after you solved the task but before generating a new one.
Here is a screenshot of & kbruch; 's modes: freestyle or learning
All exercises take place in this screen. This ensures that & kbruch; is easy to use even for young users! The main screen is separated into 5 parts:
the menubar with the 3 menus Task, Settings and Help
the toolbar, where you can set the difficulty for the tasks given in the Fraction Task exercise
the exercise chooser, where you can switch between the different exercises
the task part, where you have to enter the result of the given task
the statistical part, where you can see how many tasks have been solved correctly or attempted
Settings Window
Task Parameters
Your selection of the maximum main denominator will be reset to a default value every time you change the number of terms. So you should change the number of terms first and then select the maximum main denominator.
