Date & Time
You can use this module to alter the system date and time, using a convenient graphical interface.
As these settings do not only affect you as a user, but rather the whole system, you must have system administrator (root) access to change the system date and time. If you do not have this access level, this module will only show you the current settings, but your changes will not be saved.
Date and Time tab
You set the date using the left half of the tab. Simply choose your month and year using the controls at the top of the calendar and the day of the month by clicking on the day in the calendar.
Use the controls at the bottom of the calendar to select the current date, enter the date in the edit box or select the week of the year from the drop down box.
You set the time using the spin boxes at the bottom of the analog clock. You can also directly enter your value.
The time is represented in 24 hour format. If you want the system time to be set to 8:00 PM, you need to set the hour spinbox to 20 (8 + 12). If you want the system time set to 8:00 AM, you should set the hour spinbox to 8.
Time Zone tab
To set a new time zone, simply select your area from the list below.
NTP tab
If you check Set date and time automatically you are able to select a Time server from the drop down box.
KControl
When you first start, you are in display mode only. To modify your settings, click on Administrator Mode. If you are logged in as root, you will go straight to the change dialog. If not, & kde; will ask for a superuser password.
Modifying your settings
When you have set the correct date and time, simply click Apply to make the changes permanent.
