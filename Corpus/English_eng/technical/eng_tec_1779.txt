Sin function
Sin Function [Run-time]
Returns the sine of an angle.
The angle is specified in radians.
The result lies in the range -1 to +1.
Using the angle Alpha, the Sin Function returns the ratio of the length of the opposite side of an angle to the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.
Sin(Alpha) = side opposite the angle/hypotenuse
Syntax:
Sin (Number)
Return value:
Double
Parameters:
Number:
Numerical expression that defines the angle in radians for which you want to calculate the sine.
To convert degrees to radians, multiply degrees by Pi/180 and to convert radians to degrees, multiply radians by 180/Pi.
degrees=(radians*180)/Pi
radians=(degrees*Pi)/180
Pi is here the fixed circle constant with the rounded value 3.1415926...
Example:
REM In this example, the following entry is possible for a right-angled triangle:
REM The side opposite the angle and the angle (in degrees) to calculate the length of the hypotenuse:
Sub ExampleSine
REM Pi = 3.1415926... is a predefined variable
Dim d1 as Double
Dim dAlpha as Double
d1 = InputBox$ ( &quot; Enter the length of the opposite side: &quot; , &quot; Opposite Side &quot; )
dAlpha = InputBox$ ( &quot; Enter the angle Alpha (in degrees): &quot; , &quot; Alpha &quot; )
Print &quot; The length of the hypotenuse is &quot; ; (d1 / sin (dAlpha * Pi / 180))
End Sub
