Output file format:
Set the output file format to use here: JPEG: output the processed image in JPEG format. This format will give smaller-sized files. Minimum JPEG compression level will be used during RAW conversion. Warning: Due to the destructive compression algorithm, JPEG is a lossy quality format. TIFF: output the processed image in TIFF format. This generates large files, without losing quality. Adobe Deflate compression will be used during conversion. PPM: output the processed image in PPM format. This generates the largest files, without losing quality. PNG: output the processed image in PNG format. This generates large files, without losing quality. Maximum PNG compression will be used during conversion.
