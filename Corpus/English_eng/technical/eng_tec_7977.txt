EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
LUVERIS
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Luveris?
Luveris is a powder and solvent for solution for injection.
Luveris contains the active substance lutropin alfa.
What is Luveris used for?
Luveris is a fertility treatment.
It is used with another type of hormone (follicle stimulating hormone, FSH) to stimulate the development of eggs in the ovaries of women with severe deficiency for luteinising hormone (LH) and FSH.
Luveris can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Luveris used?
Treatment with Luveris should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems.
Luveris is given daily, together with FSH, and the patient ’ s response to treatment is monitored to check how the egg development in the ovary is progressing.
Doses are adjusted according to the response, and treatment may continue for up to 5 weeks.
Luveris powder is mixed with the solvent provided just before use, to make up a solution.
This solution can be mixed with a FSH preparation in the same syringe.
It is given by subcutaneous injection (under the skin).
The patient or their partner may carry out the subcutaneous injection once they have been trained by the doctor and provided that they have access to expert advice.
How does Luveris work?
The active substance in Luveris, lutropin alfa, is a copy of the natural luteinising hormone (LH).
In the body, LH causes the release of eggs (ovulation) during the menstrual cycle.
Luveris is used together with FSH (another hormone that stimulates ovulation).
The active ingredient of Luveris, lutropin alfa, is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’.
It is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce human LH.
How has Luveris been studied?
Luveris has been studied in two studies in a total of 81 patients, where the effect of different doses of Luveris was studied.
Because the number of patients with the condition is low, Luveris was not compared to any other medicine.
Luveris was used together with follitropin alfa – a follicle stimulating hormone preparation.
The main measure of effectiveness was the ovulation rate per menstrual cycle.

In these studies, about two thirds of the women who received 75 International Units (IU) of Luveris with follitropin alfa produced functional follicles (these are eggs in the ovaries that are ready for ovulation).
The higher doses were no more effective than the 75 IU dose, which is why this dose was selected for marketing.
What is the risk associated with Luveris?
The most common side effects (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are reactions at the injection site, headache, somnolence (sleepiness), nausea (feeling sick), abdominal (tummy) pain, pelvic (lower abdominal) pain, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (e. g. feeling sick, weight gain, diarrhoea), ovarian cyst, and breast pain.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurs when the ovaries over- respond to treatment, especially when medicines to trigger ovulation have been used.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Luveris, see the Package Leaflet.
Luveris should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to LH or FSH or any of the other ingredients, and in women who have tumours of the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, breast, uterus, or ovary.
It should also not be used when there is ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease, or vaginal bleeding.
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
Why has Luveris been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Luveris’ s benefits are greater than its risks for stimulating follicular development (when administered with a follicle stimulating hormone preparation) in women with severe luteinising hormone (LH) and FSH deficiency.
They recommended that Luveris be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Luveris:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Luveris to Serono Europe Limited on 29 November 2000.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 29 November 2005.
