system information
This page displays information about partitions on your hard drives.
The exact information displayed is system-dependent. On some systems, partition information cannot be displayed yet.
On & Linux;, this information is read from / proc/ partitions, which is only available if the / proc pseudo-filesystem is compiled into the (2.1. x or later) kernel.
The first two columns are the major and minor numbers respectively. The third column is the number of blocks (usually 1 block = 1024 bytes). The fourth column is a label for the device.
The user cannot modify any settings on this page.
