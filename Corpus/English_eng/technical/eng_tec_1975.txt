Handling of Empty Cells
Starting with OpenOffice.org 3.0 and StarOffice 9, the handling of empty cells changed.
Previously, empty cells were forced to numeric 0 in some contexts and to empty string in others, except in direct comparison where =A1=0 and =A1= &quot; &quot; both resulted in TRUE if A1 was empty.
Emptiness now is inherited until used, so both =VLOOKUP(...)=0 and =VLOOKUP(...)= &quot; &quot; give TRUE if the lookup resulted in an empty cell being returned.
A simple reference to an empty cell is still displayed as numeric 0 but is not necessarily of type numeric anymore, so also comparisons with the referencing cell work as expected.
For the following examples, A1 contains a number, B1 is empty, C1 contains the reference to B1:
A1:
1 B1: < empty > C1: =B1 (displays 0)
=B1=0 = > TRUE
=B1= &quot; &quot; = > TRUE
=C1=0 = > TRUE
=C1= &quot; &quot; = > TRUE (previously was FALSE)
=ISNUMBER(B1) = > FALSE
=ISNUMBER(C1) = > FALSE (previously was TRUE)
=ISNUMBER(VLOOKUP(1; A1:C1; 2)) = > FALSE (B1)
=ISNUMBER(VLOOKUP(1; A1:C1; 3)) = > FALSE (C1, previously was TRUE)
=ISTEXT(B1) = > FALSE
=ISTEXT(C1) = > FALSE
=ISTEXT(VLOOKUP(1; A1:C1; 2)) = > FALSE (B1, previously was TRUE)
=ISTEXT(VLOOKUP(1; A1:C1; 3)) = > FALSE (C1)
=ISBLANK(B1) = > TRUE
=ISBLANK(C1) = > FALSE
=ISBLANK(VLOOKUP(1; A1:C1; 2)) = > TRUE (B1, previously was FALSE)
=ISBLANK(VLOOKUP(1; A1:C1; 3)) = > FALSE (C1)
Note that Microsoft Excel behaves different and always returns a number as the result of a reference to an empty cell or a formula cell with the result of an empty cell.
For example:
A1: < empty >
B1: =A1 = > displays 0, but is just a reference to an empty cell
=ISNUMBER(A1) = > FALSE
=ISTEXT(A1) = > FALSE
=A1=0 = > TRUE
=A1= &quot; &quot; = > TRUE
=ISNUMBER(B1) = > FALSE (Microsoft Excel:
TRUE)
=ISTEXT(B1) = > FALSE
=B1=0 = > TRUE
=B1= &quot; &quot; = > TRUE (Microsoft Excel:
FALSE)
C1: =VLOOKUP(...) with empty cell result = > displays empty (Microsoft Excel: displays 0)
=ISNUMBER(VLOOKUP(...)) = > FALSE
=ISTEXT(VLOOKUP(...)) = > FALSE
=ISNUMBER(C1) = > FALSE (Microsoft Excel:
TRUE)
=ISTEXT(C1) = > FALSE
