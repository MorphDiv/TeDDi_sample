CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Cats
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
For cats suffering from, or at risk from, mixed parasitic infections:
For the treatment and prevention of flea infestation (Ctenocephalides felis), treatment of ear mite infestation (Otodectes cynotis), prevention of heartworm disease (L3 and L4 larvae of Dirofilaria immitis) and treatment of infections with gastrointestinal nematodes (L4 larvae, immature adults and adults of Toxocara cati and Ancylostoma tubaeforme).
The product can be used as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis (FAD).
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in kittens under 9 weeks of age.
Do not use in the case of hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.
For dogs, the corresponding “ Advocate for dog ” product, which contains 100 mg/ ml imidacloprid and 25 mg/ ml moxidectin, must be used.
2 4.4 Special warnings
Please refer to section 4.5.
Brief contact of the animal with water on one or two occasions between monthly treatments is unlikely to significantly reduce the efficacy of the product.
However, frequent shampooing or immersion of the animal in water after treatment may reduce the efficacy of the product.
Parasite resistance to any particular class of anthelmintic may develop following frequent, repeated use of an anthelmintic of that class.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
The treatment of animals weighing less than 1 kg should be based on a risk-benefit assessment.
There is limited experience on the use of the product in sick and debilitated animals, thus the product should only be used based on a risk-benefit assessment for these animals.
Care should be taken that the contents of the pipette or the applied dose does not come into contact with the eyes or mouth of the recipient and/ or other animals.
Do not allow recently treated animals to groom each other.
Oral uptake by Collies, Old English Sheepdogs and related breeds or crossbreeds should be prevented.
It is recommended that cats living in, or travelling to areas endemic for heartworm are treated monthly with the product to protect them from heartworm disease.
Whilst the accuracy of diagnosis of feline heartworm infection is limited, it is recommended that attempts be made to check the heartworm status of any cat aged over 6 months, before beginning prophylactic treatment, as use of the product on cats which have adult heartworms may cause serious adverse effects, including death.
If adult heartworm infection is diagnosed, the infection should be treated in accordance with current scientific knowledge.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Avoid contact with skin, eyes or mouth.
Do not eat, drink or smoke during application.
Wash hands thoroughly after use.
After application do not stroke or groom animals until the application site is dry.
In case of accidental spillage onto skin, wash off immediately with soap and water.
People with a known hypersensitivity to either benzyl alcohol, imidacloprid or moxidectin should administer the product with caution.
In very rare cases the product may cause skin sensitisation or transient skin reactions (for example allergy, irritation or tingling).
If the product accidentally gets into eyes, they should be thoroughly flushed with water.
If skin or eye symptoms persist, or the product is accidentally swallowed, seek medical attention and show the package insert to the physician.
The solvent in Advocate may stain certain materials including leather, fabrics, plastics and finished surfaces.
Allow the application site to dry before permitting contact with such materials.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Use of the product may result in transient pruritus in cats.
On rare occasions greasy fur, erythema and vomiting can occur.
These signs disappear without further treatment.
The product may, in rare cases, cause local hypersensitivity reactions.
If the animal licks the application site after treatment, transient neurological signs may be observed infrequently (see section 4.10 –).
3 The product tastes bitter.
Salivation may occasionally occur if the animal licks the application site immediately after treatment.
This is not a sign of intoxication and disappears within some minutes without treatment.
Correct application will minimise licking of the application site.
The product may in very rare cases cause at the application site a sensation resulting in transient behavioural changes such as lethargy, agitation, and inappetence.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation.
Laboratory studies with either imidacloprid or moxidectin in rats and rabbits have not produced any evidence of teratogenic, foetotoxic or maternotoxic effects.
Use only according to the risk-benefit assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
During treatment with Advocate no other antiparasitic macrocyclic lactone should be administered.
No interactions between Advocate and routinely used veterinary medicinal products or medical or surgical procedures have been observed.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Dosage schedule:
The recommended minimum doses are 10 mg/ kg bodyweight imidacloprid and 1.0 mg/ kg bodyweight moxidectin, equivalent to 0.1ml/ kg bodyweight Advocate for cats.
The treatment schedule should be based on the local epidemiological situation.

Flea treatment and prevention
One treatment prevents future flea infestation for 4 weeks.
Existing pupae in the environment may emerge for 6 weeks or longer after treatment is initiated, depending upon climatic conditions.
Therefore, it may be necessary to combine Advocate treatment with environmental treatments aimed at breaking the flea life cycle in the surroundings.
This can result in a more rapid reduction in the household flea population.
The product should be administered at monthly intervals when used as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis.
Treatment of ear mite infestation (Otodectes cynotis)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Do not apply directly to the ear canal.
Heartworm prevention
4 Cats in areas endemic for heartworm, or those which have travelled to endemic areas, may be infected with adult heartworms.
Therefore prior to treatment with Advocate, the advice provided in section 4.5. should be considered.
For prevention of heartworm disease, the product must be applied at regular monthly intervals during the time of the year when mosquitoes (the intermediate hosts which carry and transmit heartworm larvae) are present.
The product may be administered throughout the year or at least 1 month before the first expected exposure to mosquitoes.
Treatment should continue at regular monthly intervals until 1 month after the last exposure to mosquitoes.
To establish a treatment routine, it is recommended that the same day or date be used each month.
When replacing another heartworm preventative product in a heartworm prevention programme, the first treatment with Advocate must be given within 1 month of the last dose of the former medication.
In non-endemic areas there should be no risk of cats having heartworm.
Therefore they can be treated without special precautions.
Roundworm and hookworm treatment
In areas endemic for heartworm, monthly treatment may significantly reduce the risk of re-infection caused by the respective roundworms and hookworms.
In areas non-endemic for heartworm, the product can be used as part of a seasonal prevention programme against fleas and gastrointestinal nematodes.
Method of administration
For external use only.
Remove one pipette from the package.
Then hold the pipette in an upright position, and twist and pull off the cap.
Reverse the cap and use it to twist and remove the seal from the pipette, as shown.
Part the fur on the cat's neck at the base of the skull until the skin is visible.
Place the tip of the pipette on the skin and squeeze the pipette firmly several times to empty its contents directly onto the skin.
Application at the base of the skull will minimise the opportunity for the cat to lick the product.
Apply only to undamaged skin.
5 4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Up to 10 times the recommended dose was tolerated in cats with no evidence of adverse effects or undesirable clinical signs.
The product was administered to kittens at up to 5 times the recommended dose, every 2 weeks for 6 treatments, and there were no serious safety concerns.
Transient mydriasis, salivation, vomiting and transient rapid respiration were observed.
After accidental oral ingestion, transient neurological signs such as ataxia, generalised tremors, ocular signs (dilated pupils, little pupillary reflex, nystagmus), abnormal respiration, salivation and vomiting may occur infrequently.
In case of accidental oral uptake, symptomatic treatment should be administered.
There is no known specific antidote.
The use of activated charcoal may be beneficial.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Not applicable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: therapeutic antiparasitic agent; ATC-vet code:
QP54AB52
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Imidacloprid, 1-(6-Chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-N-nitro-imidazolidin-2-ylideneamine is an ectoparasiticide belonging to the chloronicotinyl group of compounds.
Chemically, it is more accurately described as a chloronicotinyl nitroguanidine.
Imidacloprid is effective against larval flea stages and adult fleas.
Flea larvae in the pet’ s surroundings are killed after contact with a pet treated with the product.
Imidacloprid has a high affinity for the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors in the post-synaptic region of the central nervous system (CNS) of the flea.
The ensuing inhibition of cholinergic transmission in insects results in paralysis and death.
Due to the weak nature of the interaction with mammalian nicotinergic receptors and the postulated poor penetration through the blood-brain barrier in mammals, it has virtually no effect on the mammalian CNS.
Imidacloprid has minimal pharmacological activity in mammals.
Moxidectin, 23-(O-methyloxime)-F28249 alpha is a second-generation macrocyclic lactone of the milbemycin family.
It is a parasiticide which is active against many internal and external parasites.
Moxidectin is active against larval stages (L3, L4) of Dirofilaria immitis.
It is also active against gastrointestinal nematodes.
Moxidectin interacts with GABA and glutamate-gated chloride channels.
This leads to opening of the chloride channels on the postsynaptic junction, the inflow of chloride ions and induction of an irreversible resting state.
The result is flaccid paralysis of affected parasites, followed by their death and/ or expulsion.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
After topical administration of the product, imidacloprid is rapidly distributed over the animal’ s skin within one day of application.
It can be found on the body surface throughout the treatment interval.
Moxidectin is absorbed through the skin, reaching maximum plasma concentrations approximately 1 to 2 days after treatment in cats.
Following absorption from the skin, moxidectin is distributed systemically and is slowly eliminated from the plasma as manifested by detectable moxidectin concentrations in plasma throughout the treatment interval of one month.

Special precautions for use in animals
The treatment of animals weighing less than 1 kg should be based on a risk-benefit assessment.
There is limited experience on the use of the product in sick and debilitated animals, thus the product should only be used based on a risk-benefit assessment for these animals.
Care should be taken that the contents of the pipette or the applied dose does not come into contact with the eyes or mouth of the recipient and/ or other animals.
Do not allow recently treated animals to groom each other.
When the product is applied in 3 to 4 separate spots (see section 4.9), specific care should be taken to prevent the animal licking the application sites.
This product contains moxidectin (a macrocyclic lactone), therefore special care should be taken with Collies, Old English Sheepdogs and related breeds or crossbreeds, to correctly administer the product as described under section 4.9; in particular, oral uptake by the recipient and/ or other animals in close contact should be prevented.
Advocate should not be allowed to enter surface waters as it has harmful effects on aquatic organisms: moxidectin is highly toxic to aquatic organisms.
Dogs should not be allowed to swim in surface waters for 4 days after treatment.
Although the product may be safely administered to dogs infected with adult heartworms, it has no therapeutic effect against adult Dirofilaria immitis.
It is therefore recommended that all dogs 6 months of age or more, living in areas endemic for heartworm, should be tested for existing adult heartworm infection before being treated with the product.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Avoid contact with skin, eyes or mouth.
Do not eat, drink or smoke during application.
Wash hands thoroughly after use.
After application do not stroke or groom animals until the application site is dry.
In case of accidental spillage onto skin, wash off immediately with soap and water.

Treatment of biting lice (Trichodectes canis)
A single dose should be administered.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Treatment of ear mite infestation (Otodectes cynotis)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Loose debris should be gently removed from the external ear canal at each treatment.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Do not apply directly to the ear canal.
Treatment of sarcoptic mange (caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var. canis)
A single dose should be administered twice 4 weeks apart.
Treatment of demodicosis (caused by Demodex canis)
A single dose administered 2 to 4 times at 4 weekly intervals is efficacious against Demodex canis and leads to a marked improvement of clinical signs.
As demodicosis is a multi-factorial disease, where possible, it is advisable to also treat any underlying disease appropriately.
Heartworm prevention
Dogs in areas endemic for heartworm, or those which have travelled to endemic areas, may be infected with adult heartworms.
Therefore prior to treatment with Advocate, the advice provided in section 4.5. should be considered.
For prevention of heartworm disease, the product must be applied at regular monthly intervals during the time of the year when mosquitoes (the intermediate hosts which carry and transmit heartworm larvae) are present.
The product may be administered throughout the year or at least 1 month before the first expected exposure to mosquitoes.
Treatment should continue at regular monthly intervals until 1 month after the last exposure to mosquitoes.
To establish a treatment routine, it is recommended that the same day or date be used each month.
When replacing another heartworm preventative product in a heartworm prevention programme, the first treatment with Advocate must be given within 1 month of the last dose of the former medication.
In non-endemic areas there should be no risk of dogs having heartworm.
Therefore they can be treated without special precautions.
Treatment of Angiostrongylus vasorum
A single dose should be administered.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Roundworm, hookworm and whipworm treatment
12 In areas endemic for heartworm, monthly treatment may significantly reduce the risk of re-infection caused by the respective round-, hook- and whipworms.
In areas non-endemic for heartworm, the product can be used as part of a seasonal prevention programme against fleas and gastrointestinal nematodes.
Studies have shown that monthly treatment of dogs will prevent infections caused by Uncinaria stenocephala.
Method of administration
For external use only.
Remove one pipette from the package.
Then hold the pipette in an upright position, and twist and pull off the cap.
Reverse the cap and use it to twist and remove the seal from the pipette, as shown.
For dogs up to 25 kg:
With the dog in a standing position, part the coat between the shoulder blades until the skin is visible.
Wherever possible apply to undamaged skin.
Place the tip of the pipette on the skin and squeeze the pipette firmly several times to empty its contents directly onto the skin.
For dogs of more than 25 kg:
For easy application the dog should be standing.
The entire contents of the pipette should be applied evenly as 3 or 4 spots along the top of the back, from between the shoulders to the base of the tail.
At each spot, part the coat until the skin is visible.
Wherever possible apply to undamaged skin.
Place the tip of the pipette on the skin and gently squeeze the pipette to expel a portion of its contents directly onto the skin.
Do not apply an excessive amount of solution at any one spot, as that could cause some of the product to run down the animal’ s side.
13 4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Up to 10 times the recommended dose was tolerated in adult dogs with no evidence of adverse effects or undesirable clinical signs.
The product was administered to puppies at up to 5 times the recommended dose, every 2 weeks for 6 treatments, and there were no serious safety concerns.
Transient mydriasis, salivation, vomiting and transient rapid respiration were observed.
After accidental oral ingestion, transient neurological signs such as ataxia, generalised tremors, ocular signs (dilated pupils, little pupillary reflex, nystagmus), abnormal respiration, salivation and vomiting may occur infrequently.
Ivermectin-sensitive Collie dogs tolerated up to 5 times the recommended dose without any adverse effects.
However, when 40% of the unit dose was given orally, severe neurological signs were observed.
Oral administration of 10% of the recommended dose produced no adverse effects.
Dogs infected with adult heartworms tolerated up to 5 times the recommended dose, every 2 weeks for 3 treatments, without any adverse effects.
In case of accidental oral uptake, symptomatic treatment should be administered.
There is no known specific antidote.
The use of activated charcoal may be beneficial.

Excipients:

INDICATION(S)
For cats suffering from, or at risk from, mixed parasitic infections:
For the treatment and prevention of flea infestation (Ctenocephalides felis), treatment of ear mite infestation (Otodectes cynotis), prevention of heartworm disease (L3 and L4 larvae of Dirofilaria immitis) and treatment of infections with gastrointestinal nematodes (L4 larvae, immature adults and adults of Toxocara cati and Ancylostoma tubaeforme).
The product can be used as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis (FAD).
5.
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not use in kittens under 9 weeks of age.
Do not use in the case of hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation.
Laboratory studies with either imidacloprid or moxidectin in rats and rabbits have not
52 produced any evidence of teratogenic, foetotoxic or maternotoxic effects.
Use only according to the risk-benefit assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
For dogs, the corresponding “ Advocate for dog ” product, which contains 100 mg/ ml imidacloprid and 25 mg/ ml moxidectin, must be used.
6.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Use of the product may result in transient pruritus in cats.
On rare occasions greasy fur, erythema and vomiting can occur.
These signs disappear without further treatment.
The product may, in rare cases, cause local hypersensitivity reactions.
If the animal licks the application site after treatment, transient neurological signs such as ataxia, generalised tremors, ocular signs (dilated pupils, little pupillary reflex, nystagmus), abnormal respiration, salivation and vomiting may occur infrequently.
The product tastes bitter.
Salivation may occasionally occur if the animal licks the application site immediately after treatment.
This is not a sign of intoxication and disappears within some minutes without treatment.
Correct application will minimise licking of the application site.
The product may in very rare cases cause at the application site a sensation resulting in transient behavioural changes such as lethargy, agitation, and inappetence.
In case of accidental oral uptake, symptomatic treatment should be performed by a veterinary surgeon.
There is no known specific antidote.
The use of activated charcoal may be beneficial.
If you notice any serious effects or other effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your veterinary surgeon.
7.
TARGET SPECIES
Cats
8.
DOSAGE FOR EACH SPECIES, ROUTE(S) AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
For external use only.
To prevent licking, apply topically to the skin restricting the area of application to the cat’ s neck at the base of the skull.
Dosage schedule
The recommended minimum doses are 10 mg/ kg bodyweight imidacloprid and 1.0 mg/ kg bodyweight moxidectin, equivalent to 0.1 ml/ kg bodyweight Advocate for cats.
The treatment schedule should be based on the local epidemiological situation.

53 Flea treatment and prevention
One treatment prevents further flea infestation for 4 weeks.
Pre-existing pupae in the environment may continue to emerge for 6 weeks or longer after treatment is initiated depending upon climatic conditions.
Therefore, it may be necessary to combine Advocate treatment with treatments aimed at breaking the flea life cycle in the surroundings.
This can result in more rapid reductions in the household flea population.
The product should be administered at monthly intervals when used as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis.
Treatment of ear mite infestation (Otodectes cynotis)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Do not apply directly to the ear canal.
Heartworm prevention
Cats in endemic areas, or those which have travelled to endemic areas, may be infected with adult heartworms.
Therefore prior to treatment with Advocate, the advice provided in the section “ SPECIAL WARNING(S )” should be considered.
For prevention of heartworm disease, the product must be applied at regular monthly intervals during the time of the year when mosquitoes (the intermediate hosts which carry and transmit heartworm larvae) are present.
The product may be administered throughout the year or at least 1 month before the first expected exposure to mosquitoes.
The treatment should continue at regular monthly intervals until 1 month after the last exposure to mosquitoes.
To establish a treatment routine, it is recommended that the same day or date be used each month.
When replacing another heartworm preventative product in a heartworm prevention programme, the first treatment with Advocate must be given within 1 month of the last dose of the former medication.
In non-endemic areas there should be no risk of cats having heartworm.
Therefore they can be treated without special considerations.
Roundworm and hookworm treatment
In areas endemic for heartworm, monthly treatment may significantly reduce the risk of re-infection caused by the respective roundworms and hookworms.
In areas non-endemic for heartworm, the product can be used as part of a seasonal prevention programme against fleas and gastrointestinal nematodes.
9.
ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
Remove one pipette from the package.
Then hold the pipette in an upright position, and twist and pull off cap.
Reverse the cap and use it to twist and remove the seal from the pipette, as shown.
Part the fur on the cat's neck at the base of the skull until the skin is visible.
Place the tip of the pipette on the skin and squeeze the pipette firmly several times to empty its contents directly onto the skin.
54 Application at the base of the skull will minimise the opportunity for the cat to lick the product.
Apply only to undamaged skin.
10.
WITHDRAWAL PERIOD
Not applicable.
11.
SPECIAL STORAGE PRECAUTIONS
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Do not store above 30°C.
Do not use after the expiry date stated on the label and carton.
12.
SPECIAL WARNING(S)
Care should be taken that the contents of the pipette do not come into contact with the eyes or mouth of the recipient and/ or other animals.
Do not allow recently treated animals to groom each other.
Oral uptake by Collies, Old English Sheepdogs and related breeds or crossbreeds should be prevented.
It is recommended that cats living in, or travelling to, areas endemic for heartworm are treated monthly with the product to protect them from heartworm disease.
Whilst the accuracy of diagnosis of feline heartworm infection is limited, it is recommended that attempts be made to check the heartworm status of any cat aged over 6 months, prior to beginning of prophylactic treatment, as use of the product on cats which have adult heartworm may cause serious adverse effects, including death.
If adult heartworm infection is diagnosed, the infection should be treated in accordance with current scientific knowledge.
Treatment of animals weighing less than 1 kg should be based on a risk-benefit assessment.
There is limited experience on the use of the product in sick and debilitated animals, thus the product should only be used based on a risk-benefit assessment for these animals.
Brief contact of the animal with water on one or two occasions between monthly treatments is unlikely to significantly reduce the efficacy of the product.
However, frequent shampooing or immersion of the animal in water after treatment may reduce the efficacy of the product.
For persons administering Advocate to animals:
Avoid contact with skin, eyes or mouth.
Do not eat, drink or smoke during application.
55 Wash hands thoroughly after use.
After application do not stroke or groom animals until the application site is dry.
In case of accidental spillage onto skin, wash off immediately with soap and water.
People with a known hypersensitivity to either benzyl alcohol, imidacloprid or moxidectin should administer the product with caution.
In very rare cases the product may cause skin sensitisation or transient skin reactions (for example allergy, irritation or tingling).
If the product accidentally gets into eyes, they should be thoroughly flushed with water.
If skin or eye symptoms persist, or the product is accidentally swallowed, seek medical attention and show the package insert to the physician.
The solvent in Advocate may stain certain materials including leather, fabrics, plastics and finished surfaces.
Allow the application site to dry before permitting contact with such materials.
13.
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED PRODUCT OR WASTE MATERIALS, IF ANY
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
Ask your veterinary surgeon how to dispose of medicines no longer required.
These measures should help to protect the environment.

ADVERSE REACTIONS
Use of the product may result in transient pruritus in dogs.
On rare occasions greasy hair, erythema and vomiting can occur.
These signs disappear without further treatment.
The product may, in rare cases, cause local hypersensitivity reactions.
If the animal licks the application site after treatment, transient neurological signs, such as ataxia, generalised tremors, ocular signs (dilated pupils, little pupillary reflex, nystagmus), abnormal respiration, salivation and vomiting, may occur infrequently.
The product tastes bitter.
Salivation may occasionally occur if the animal licks the application site immediately after treatment.
This is not a sign of intoxication and disappears within some minutes without treatment.
Correct application will minimise licking of the application sites.
The product may in very rare cases cause at the application site a sensation resulting in transient behavioural changes such as lethargy, agitation, and inappetence.
In case of accidental oral uptake, symptomatic treatment should be administered by a veterinary surgeon.
There is no known specific antidote.
The use of activated charcoal may be beneficial.

treatment and prevention
One treatment prevents further flea infestation for 4 weeks.
Pre-existing pupae in the environment may continue to emerge for 6 weeks or longer after treatment is initiated depending upon climatic conditions.
Therefore, it may be necessary to combine Advocate treatment with treatments aimed at breaking the flea life cycle in the surroundings.
This can result in more rapid reductions in the household flea population.
The product should be administered at monthly intervals when used as part of a treatment strategy for flea allergy dermatitis.
Treatment of biting lice (Trichodectes canis)
A single dose should be administered.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Treatment of ear mite infestation (Otodectes cynotis)
A single dose of the product should be administered.
Loose debris should be gently removed from the external ear canal at each treatment.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Do not apply directly to the ear canal.
Treatment of sarcoptic mange (caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var. canis)
A single dose should be administered twice 4 weeks apart.
Treatment of demodicosis (caused by Demodex canis)
A single dose administered 2 to 4 times at 4 weekly intervals is efficacious against Demodex canis and leads to a marked improvement of clinical signs.
As demodicosis is a multi-factorial disease, where possible, it is advisable to also treat any underlying disease appropriately.
Heartworm prevention
Dogs in areas endemic for heartworm, or those which have travelled to endemic areas, may be infected with adult heartworms.
Therefore before treatment with Advocate, the advice provided in the section ” SPECIAL WARNING(S )“ should be considered.
For prevention of heartworm disease, the product must be applied at regular monthly intervals during the time of the year when mosquitoes (the intermediate hosts which carry and transmit heartworm larvae) are present.
The product may be administered throughout the year or at least 1 month before the first expected exposure to mosquitoes.
The treatment should continue at regular monthly intervals until 1 month after the last exposure to mosquitoes.
To establish a treatment routine, it is recommended that the same day or date be used each month.
When replacing another heartworm preventative product in a heartworm prevention programme, the first treatment with Advocate must be given within 1 month of the last dose of the former medication.
In non-endemic areas there should be no risk of dogs having heartworm.
Therefore they can be treated without special precautions.
61 Treatment of Angiostrongylus vasorum
A single dose should be administered.
A further veterinary examination 30 days after treatment is recommended as some animals may require a second treatment.
Roundworm, hookworm and whipworm treatment
In areas endemic for heartworm, monthly treatment may significantly reduce the risk of re-infection caused by the respective roundworm, hookworms and whipworms.
In areas non-endemic for heartworm, the product can be used as part of a seasonal prevention programme against fleas and gastrointestinal nematodes.
Studies have shown that monthly treatment of dogs will prevent infections caused by Uncinaria stenocephala.
9.
ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
Remove one pipette from the package.
Then hold the pipette in an upright position, and twist and pull off the cap.
Reverse the cap and use it to twist and remove the seal from the pipette, as shown.
For dogs up to 25 kg:
With the dog in a standing position, part the coat between the shoulder blades until the skin is visible.
Wherever possible apply to undamaged skin.
Place the tip of the pipette on the skin and squeeze the pipette firmly several times to empty its contents directly onto the skin.
For dogs of more than 25 kg:
For easy application the dog should be standing.
The entire contents of the pipette should be applied evenly as 3 or 4 spots along the top of the back, from between the shoulders to the base of the tail.
At each spot part the coat until the skin is visible.
Wherever possible apply to undamaged skin.
Place the tip of the pipette on the skin and gently squeeze the pipette to expel a portion of its contents directly onto the skin.
Do not apply an excessive amount of solution at any one spot, as that could cause some of the product to run down the animal's side.
62 10.
WITHDRAWAL PERIOD
Not applicable.
11.
SPECIAL STORAGE PRECAUTIONS
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Do not store above 30°C.
Do not use after the expiry date stated on the label and carton.
12.
SPECIAL WARNING(S)
Care should be taken that the contents of the pipette do not come into contact with the eyes or mouth of the recipient and/ or other animals.
Do not allow recently treated animals to groom each other.
When the product is applied in 3 to 4 separate spots, specific care should be taken to prevent the animal licking the application sites.
This product contains moxidectin (a macrocyclic lactone), therefore special care should be taken with Collies, Old English Sheepdogs and related breeds or crossbreeds, to correctly administer the product as described under the section “ ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION”; in particular, oral uptake by the recipient and/ or other animals in close contact should be prevented.
Although the product may be safely administered to dogs infected with adult heartworms, it has no therapeutic efficacy against adult Dirofilaria immitis.
It is therefore recommended that all dogs 6 months of age or more, living in areas endemic for heartworm, should be tested for existing adult heartworm infection before being treated with the product.
Treatment of animals weighing less than 1 kg should be based on a risk-benefit assessment.
There is limited experience on the use of the product in sick and debilitated animals, thus the product should only be used based on a risk-benefit assessment for these animals.
Brief contact of the animal with water on one or two occasions between monthly treatments is unlikely to significantly reduce the efficacy of the product.
However, frequent shampooing or immersion of the animal in water after treatment may reduce the efficacy of the product.
Advocate should not be allowed to enter surface waters as it has harmful effects on aquatic organisms: moxidectin is highly toxic to aquatic organisms.
Dogs should not be allowed to swim in surface waters for 4 days after treatment.
For persons administering Advocate to animals:
Avoid contact with skin, eyes or mouth.
63 Do not eat, drink or smoke during application.
Wash hands thoroughly after use.
After application do not stroke or groom animals until the application site is dry.
In case of accidental spillage onto skin, wash off immediately with soap and water.
People with a known hypersensitivity to either benzyl alcohol, imidacloprid or moxidectin should administer the product with caution.
In very rare cases the product may cause skin sensitisation or transient skin reactions (for example allergy, irritation or tingling).
If the product accidentally gets into eyes, they should be thoroughly flushed with water.
If skin or eye symptoms persist, or the product is accidentally swallowed, seek medical attention and show the package insert to the physician.
The solvent in Advocate may stain certain materials including leather, fabrics, plastics and finished surfaces.
Allow the application site to dry before permitting contact with such materials.
13.
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED PRODUCT OR WASTE MATERIALS, IF ANY
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
Ask your veterinary surgeon how to dispose of medicines no longer required.
