Select the format for video cameras (does not apply to most USB cameras)
Video preview
Display images from your camera device
Frame Rate
The maximum transmitted frame rate in frames/s. This rate may not be reached in case a minimum quality was configure via a TSTO value smaller than 31 and the bitrate selected is not sufficient to support this minimum quality

Select an alternative audio output device to use for sound events.
The incoming call sound
The sound that will be played on incoming calls, if enabled
Play sound on incoming calls
The chosen sound will be played on incoming calls, if enabled
The new instant message sound
The sound that will be played when there is a new instant message, if enabled
Play sound on new message
The chosen sound will be played when a new instant message is received, if enabled
The new voice mail sound
The sound that will be played when there is a new voice mail, if enabled
Play sound on new voice mail
The chosen sound will be played when a new voice mail is received, if enabled
Play ring tone
The chosen sound will be played when calling somebody, if enabled
The dial tone sound
The sound that will be played when calling somebody, if enabled

The busy tone sound
The sound that will be played at the end of calls or when calling somebody who is busy, if enabled
The accounts list
The list of accounts to which Ekiga should register
Listen port
The port to listen to for incoming connections. Ekiga needs to be restarted for the new value to take effect
Outbound Proxy
The SIP Outbound Proxy to use for outgoing calls
Forward calls to host
The host where calls should be forwarded if call forwarding is enabled
DTMF sending
This allows you to set the mode for sending DTMFs. The values can be "RFC2833" (0), "INFO" (1)
The port to listen to for incoming connections. Ekiga needs to be restarted for the new value to take effect.
TCP port range
The range of TCP ports that Ekiga will use for the H.323 H.245 channel. This port range has no effect if both participants to the conference are using H.245 Tunneling.
UDP port range
The range of UDP ports that Ekiga will use.
Enable H.245 tunneling
This enables H.245 Tunneling mode. In H.245 Tunneling mode H.245 messages are encapsulated into the H.225 channel (port 1720). This saves one TCP connection during calls. H.245 Tunneling was introduced in H.323v2 and Netmeeting does not support it. Using both Fast Start and H.245 Tunneling can crash some versions of Netmeeting.
Enable early H.245
This enables H.245 early in the setup
Enable 'Fast Start'
Connection will be established in Fast Start mode. Fast Start is a new way to start calls faster that was introduced in H.323v2. It is not supported by Netmeeting and using both Fast Start and H.245 Tunneling can crash some versions of Netmeeting
This allows you to set the mode for sending DTMFs. The values can be "String" (0), "Tone" (1), "RFC2833" (2), "Q.931" (3) (default is "String"). Choosing other values than "String" disables the Text Chat
Always forward calls to the given host
If enabled, all incoming calls will be forwarded to the host that is specified in the field below
Forward calls to the given host if busy
If enabled, all incoming calls will be forwarded to the host that is specified in the field below if you already are in a call or if you are in Do Not Disturb mode
Forward calls to the given host if no answer
If enabled, all incoming calls will be forwarded to the host that is specified in the field below if you do not answer the call
The STUN Server
The STUN server to use for STUN Support. STUN is a technology that permits passage through some types of NAT gateway
Disable STUN network detection
Disable the automatic network setup resulting from the STUN test
NAT Binding Timeout
Enter the number of seconds after which Ekiga should try refreshing the NAT binding when STUN is being used

The position of the local video window
Remote video window size
The size of the remote video window
Remote video window position
The position of the remote video window
Maximum jitter buffer
The maximum jitter buffer size for audio reception (in ms)
The Video Codecs List
The video codecs list
Maximum TX video bitrate
The maximum TX video bitrate in kbit/s. The video quality and the number of transmitted frames per second (depends on selected codec) will be dynamically adjusted above their minimum during calls to try to minimize the bandwidth to the given value
Maximum RX video bitrate
The maximum RX video bitrate in kbit/s. This value will be signaled to the peer endpoint that can adjust (if it supports it) its TX bitrate if it is above the signaled value
Temporal Spatial Trade Off
Whether to prefer to sustain the max. frame rate or lower it possibly in order to keep a minimum level of (spatial) quality for all frames. 0: Highest minimal quality, 31: lowest minimal quality
