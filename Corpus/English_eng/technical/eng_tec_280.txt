key, to select it without executing any hyperlinks it may refer to.
Keep the mouse button pressed and wait a moment while the object is copied to an internal memory.
If the documents are not visible side by side, first move the mouse pointer to the button of the target document while keeping the mouse button pressed.
The document in question is then displayed and you can move the mouse pointer into the document.
Release the mouse button as soon as the grey text cursor indicates the position where you want to insert a copy of the picture.
If the graphic is connected with a hyperlink, the hyperlink and not the graphic is inserted.
