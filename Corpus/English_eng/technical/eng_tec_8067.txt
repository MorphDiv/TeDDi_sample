CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Xelevia is indicated:
• to improve glycaemic control in combination with metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
• to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.
• to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPARγ agonist (i. e. a thiazolidinedione) is appropriate, Xelevia is indicated:
• in combination with the PPARγ agonist when diet and exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The dose of Xelevia is 100 mg once daily.
The dosage of metformin or PPARγ agonist should be maintained, and sitagliptin administered concomitantly.
When Xelevia is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.
(See section 4.4.)
If a dose of Xelevia is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers.
A double dose should not be taken on the same day.
Xelevia can be taken with or without food.
2 Patients with renal insufficiency For patients with mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 50 ml/ min), no dosage adjustment for Xelevia is required.
Clinical study experience with Xelevia in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency is limited.
Therefore, use of Xelevia is not recommended in this patient population (see section 5.2).
Patients with hepatic insufficiency No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency.
Xelevia has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency.
Elderly No dosage adjustment is necessary based on age.
Limited safety data is available in patients 75 years of age and care should be exercised.
Paediatric population Xelevia is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on its safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 4.4 and 4.8).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Xelevia should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Hypoglycaemia when used in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic agents In clinical trials of Xelevia as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy with agents not known to cause hypoglycaemia (i. e. metformin or pioglitazone), rates of hypoglycaemia reported with sitagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo.
When sitagliptin was added to a sulphonylurea, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was increased over that of placebo (see section 4.8).
Therefore, to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, a lower dose of sulphonylurea may be considered (see section 4.2).
The use of sitagliptin in combination with insulin has not been adequately studied.
Renal insufficiency As the experience is limited, patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency should not be treated with Xelevia (see section 5.2).
Hypersensitivity Reactions Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with Xelevia have been reported.
These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with Xelevia, with some reports occurring after the first dose.
If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue Xelevia, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Effects of other medicinal products on sitagliptin Clinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by co- administered medicinal products is low.
3 Metformin:
Co-administration of multiple twice-daily doses of 1000 mg metformin with 50 mg sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Cyclosporine:
A study was conducted to assess the effect of cyclosporine, a potent inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.
Coadministration of a single 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin and a single 600 mg oral dose of cyclosporine increased the AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin by approximately 29% and 68%, respectively.
These changes in sitagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically meaningful.
The renal clearance of sitagliptin was not meaningfully altered.
Therefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other p-glycoprotein inhibitors.
In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin is CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8.
In patients with normal renal function, metabolism, including via CYP3A4, plays only a small role in the clearance of sitagliptin.
Metabolism may play a more significant role in the elimination of sitagliptin in the setting of severe renal insufficiency or ESRD.
For this reason, it is possible that potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i. e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) could alter the phamacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with severe renal insufficiency or ESRD.
The effects of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in the setting of renal insufficiency has not been assessed in a clinical study.
In vitro transport studies showed that sitagliptin is a substrate for p-glycoprotein and OAT3.
OAT3 mediated transport of sitagliptin was inhibited in vitro by probenecid, although the risk of clinically meaningful interactions is considered to be low.
Concomitant administration of OAT3 inhibitors has not been evaluated in vivo.
Effects of sitagliptin on other medicinal products In vitro data suggest that sitagliptin does not inhibit nor induce CYP450 isoenzymes.
In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, warfarin, or oral contraceptives, providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).
Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations, and may be a mild inhibitor of p- glycoprotein in vivo.
Digoxin:
Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations.
Following administration of 0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly with 100 mg of Xelevia daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of digoxin was increased on average by 11%, and the plasma Cmax on average by 18%.
No dosage adjustment of digoxin is recommended.
However, patients at risk of digoxin toxicity should be monitored for this when sitagliptin and digoxin are administered concomitantly.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of Xelevia in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Due to lack of human data, Xelevia should not be used during pregnancy.
Lactation It is unknown whether sitagliptin is excreted in human breast milk.
Animal studies have shown excretion of sitagliptin in breast milk.
Xelevia should not be used during breast-feeding.
4 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, when driving or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness and somnolence have been reported.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In 9 large clinical trials of up to 2 years in duration, over 2700 patients have received treatment with Xelevia 100 mg per day alone or in combination with metformin, a sulphonylurea (with or without metformin) or a PPARγ agent.
In these trials, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse experiences considered drug-related was 0.8% with 100 mg per day and 1.5% with other treatments.
No adverse reactions considered as drug-related were reported in patients treated with sitagliptin occurring in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients treated with control.
Adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin occurring in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients treated with placebo are listed below (Table 1) by system organ class and frequency.
Frequencies are defined as: very common (1/ 10); common (1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (1/ 1000, < 1/ 100); rare (1/ 10000, < 1/ 1000); and very rare (< 1/ 10000).

5 * In clinical trials of Xelevia as monotherapy and sitagliptin as part of combination therapy with metformin or pioglitazone, rates of hypoglycaemia reported with sitagliptin were similar to rates in patients taking placebo.
1 In this placebo-controlled 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in combination with metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin/ metformin compared to treatment with placebo/ metformin was 9.3% and 10.1%, respectively.
In an additional 1-year study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in combination with metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin/ metformin compared to sulphonylurea/ metformin was 14.5% and 30.3%, respectively.
In pooled studies of up to 1 year in duration comparing sitagliptin/ metformin to a sulphonylurea agent/ metformin, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg occurring in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving the sulphonylurea agent are as follows: anorexia (Metabolism and nutritional disorders; frequency uncommon) and weight decreased (Investigations; frequency uncommon).
2 In this 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in combination with glimepiride, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin/ glimepiride compared to treatment with placebo/ glimepiride was 11.3% and 6.6%, respectively.
3 In this 24-week study of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in combination with glimepiride and metformin, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin in combination with glimepiride/ metformin compared to treatment with placebo in combination with glimepiride/ metformin was 18.1% and 7.1%, respectively.
4 In this 24-week study of the combination of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily and pioglitazone, the incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with sitagliptin/ pioglitazone compared to patients treated with placebo/ pioglitazone was 9.1% and 9.0%, respectively.
In addition, in monotherapy studies of up to 24 weeks in duration of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily alone compared to placebo, adverse reactions considered as drug-related reported in patients treated with sitagliptin in excess (> 0.2% and difference > 1 patient) of that in patients receiving placebo are headache, hypoglycaemia, constipation, and dizziness.
In addition to the drug-related adverse experiences described above, adverse experiences reported regardless of causal relationship to medication and occurring in at least 5% and more commonly in patients treated with Xelevia included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis.
Additional adverse experiences reported regardless of causal relationship to medication that occurred more frequently in patients treated with Xelevia (not reaching the 5% level, but occurring with an incidence of > 0.5% higher with Xelevia than that in the control group) included osteoarthritis and pain in extremity.
In a 24-week study of initial combination therapy with sitagliptin and metformin administered twice daily (sitagliptin/ metformin 50 mg/ 500 mg or 50 mg/ 1000 mg), the overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin compared to patients treated with placebo was 14.0% and 9.7%, respectively.
The overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was comparable to metformin alone (14.0% each) and greater than sitagliptin alone (6.7%), with the differences relative to sitagliptin alone primarily due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
6 Across clinical studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/ microl difference in WBC vs. placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/ microl) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils.
This observation was seen in most but not all studies.
This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant.
No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed with Xelevia treatment.
Post-marketing Experience:
During post-marketing experience the following additional side effects have been reported (frequency not known): hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were generally well tolerated.
Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin.
There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in humans.
In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e. g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required.
Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable.
In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session.
Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate.
It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
DPP-4 Inhibitor, ATC code:
A10BH01.
Xelevia is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.
The improvement in glycaemic control observed with this agent may be mediated by enhancing the levels of active incretin hormones.
Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal.
The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis.
When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP.
Treatment with GLP-1 or with DPP-4 inhibitors in animal models of type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated to improve beta cell responsiveness to glucose and stimulate insulin biosynthesis and release.
With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake is enhanced.
In addition, GLP-1 lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells.
Decreased glucagon concentrations, along with higher insulin levels, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, resulting in a decrease in blood glucose levels.
The effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent such that when blood glucose concentrations are low, stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon secretion by GLP-1 are not observed.
For both GLP-1 and GIP, stimulation of insulin release is enhanced as glucose rises above normal concentrations.
Further, GLP-1 does not impair the normal glucagon response to hypoglycaemia.
The activity of GLP-1 and GIP is limited by the DPP-4 enzyme, which rapidly hydrolyzes the incretin hormones to produce inactive products.
Sitagliptin prevents the hydrolysis of incretin hormones by DPP-4, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the active forms of GLP-1 and GIP.
By enhancing active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in a glucose-
