extend_dmalloc
1
Analyze return-addresses from dmalloc logfiles.
extend_dmalloc dmalloc-log binary
Description
extend_dmalloc will run gdb (1) to get information on the return-addresses from a dmalloc (1) logfile. Specifically it will examine any ra= lines and try to get the corresponding line numbers
The argument binary must be the binary that generated the log dmalloc-log.
This utility is part of the & kde; Software Development Kit.
Notes
You may wish to direct the output from extend_dmalloc to a file, since otherwise gdb seems to prompt for a return as if you are at the end of a page.
