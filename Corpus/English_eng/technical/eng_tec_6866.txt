About library.gnome.org
library.gnome.org aims to be the central place for documentation related to the GNOME project, be it for users, system administrators or developers.
Its development tree is hosted in the GNOME GIT repository, in the library-web module.
This web site in different languages
When you request a document from a server, your language preference is passed via HTTP Accept-Language header. This is a standard way to deliver the preferred version of a page available in more than one language. It is very important to setup your browser language preference correctly.
What to do if page is in wrong language
The usual reason is that your web browser is improperly configured. Skip to
If your browser is configured, the problem may be that your ISP or your internal network is using misconfigured cache or proxy server. They are servers without any content that sits in the middle between users and real web servers. They grab your requests for web pages and fetch the page. After that, they forward the page to you but also make a local, cached copy, for later requests. This can really cut down on network traffic when many users request the same page.
Problem is when they do not understand content negotiation and keep cached copy of a page in only one language. The only way you can fix this is to complain to your ISP in order for them to upgrade or replace their software.
Third problem may be that you are unable or do not want to change browser settings. If you have JavaScript and cookies enabled, our server will store your language preference in a cookie every time you change language manually by clicking on a link. The next time you click on link to another page, your language selection will be preserved.
How to set up the language settings
Generally, you should include all languages you can read in preferred language, ordered by preference. It is good idea to include English ('en') as last item in your list, to use it as a fallback language. You need to be careful with sub-categories of languages, en-GB will not include en, so you need to include both en and en-GB in your list.

Requesting for a documentation to be added
Library.gnome.org has support for both gnome-doc-utils (manuals) and gtk-doc (references) as well as some minimalistic support for straight passing of HTML files through XSL stylesheets. It can also display links to resource available on other websites.
Modules that are part of the GNOME JHBuild modulesets, as published by the release team, are automatically added to the library. For other modules you have to
Please note Library.gnome.org only operates on tarballs, there is no support for documents that are only available through a revision control system, so the first thing is to make sure when requesting for a new document to be added is that a tarball is available. It also has some special support for tarballs hosted on download.gnome.org and will automatically pick up new versions.
