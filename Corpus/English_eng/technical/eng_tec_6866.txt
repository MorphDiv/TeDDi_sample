The Emoticons Theme Manager
Emoticons can be used in several & kde; applications: & kopete;, & konversation;, & kmail;... This module offers you to easily manage your emoticons sets. You can:
add emoticons themes
remove emoticons themes
install an existing theme
add, remove or edit emoticons within a theme
Please note that you will set emoticons themes per application.
The module is separated in two parts: on the left you can manage your themes and on the right you can manage emoticons within themes.
An emoticon consists in two parts: an icon (typically a. png,. mng or. gif picture) and a text describing the emoticon. The text can be some ASCII symbols like]: - > or the emoticon short description enclosed within * like *FRIEND*. The user types the symbol or the text and the emoticon icon replaces it.
The emoticons themes will be saved locally in your home in $KDEHOME/ share/ emoticons.
Emoticons Themes
This section allows you to manage emoticons themes.
Require spaces around emoticons
When this option is checked, you need to separate the emoticon with a white space before and after it so it is changed to an icon. If you type "Hello: -)" then this string will stay as it is while if you type "Hello: -)" you will get "Hello" followed by the: -) emoticon.
When this option is not checked (default), each emoticon string will be replaced by its icon.
New Theme...
You can create your own new theme from scratch. Clicking on this button brings a dialog asking for the name of the new theme. You can then use the Add... button on the right to create new emoticons and their associated text.
Get New Themes...

Install Theme File...
This action allows you to install a theme you downloaded yourself. A theme file is an archive file, usually a. tar. gz or a. zip file or any other archive files.
