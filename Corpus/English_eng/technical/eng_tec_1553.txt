Multiple Monitors
By default the primary monitor is used for slide show mode.
If the current desktop is displayed on more than one monitor, you can select which monitor to use for full screen slide show mode.
If the current desktop spans only one monitor, or if the multi monitor feature is not supported on the current system, you cannot select another monitor.
Presentation Monitor
Select a monitor to use for full screen slide show mode.
If the system allows to span a window over all available monitors, you can also select &quot; All monitors &quot; .
In this case the presentation spans over all available monitors.
This setting is saved in the user configuration and not inside the document.
