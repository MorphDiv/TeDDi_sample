GKsu version %s
Usage: %s [-u <user>] [options] <command>
--debug, -d
 Print information on the screen that might be
 useful for diagnosing and/or solving problems.

--user <user>, -u <user>
 Call <command> as the specified user.
--disable-grab, -g
 Disable the "locking" of the keyboard, mouse,
 and focus done by the program when asking for
 password.
--prompt, -P
 Ask the user if they want to have their keyboard
 and mouse grabbed before doing so.
--preserve-env, -k
 Preserve the current environments, does not set $HOME
 nor $PATH, for example.
--login, -l
 Make this a login shell. Beware this may cause
 problems with the Xauthority magic. Run xhost
 to allow the target user to open windows on your
 display!
--description <description\|file>, -D <description\|file>
 Provide a descriptive name for the command to
 be used in the default message, making it nicer.
 You can also provide the absolute path for a
 .desktop file. The Name key for will be used in
 this case.
--message <message>, -m <message>
 Replace the standard message shown to ask for
 password for the argument passed to the option.
 Only use this if --description does not suffice.
--print-pass, -p
 Ask gksu to print the password to stdout, just
 like ssh-askpass. Useful to use in scripts with
 programs that accept receiving the password on
 stdin.
--sudo-mode, -S
 Make GKSu use sudo instead of su, as if it had been
 run as "gksudo".
--su-mode, -w
 Make GKSu use su, instead of using libgksu's
 default.
--always-ask-pass
 Make GKSu always ask for a password, even if it is cached
 by sudo.
