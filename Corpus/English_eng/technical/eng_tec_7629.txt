CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs.
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
As an aid in the treatment of separation-related disorders in dogs manifested by destruction and inappropriate behaviours (vocalisation and inappropriate defecation and/ or urination) and only in combination with behavioural modification techniques.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in dogs weighing less than 4 kg.
Do not use in dogs with epilepsy or in dogs with a history of seizures.
Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to fluoxetine or other Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).
2/ 33 4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
The safety of Reconcile has not been established in dogs under 6 months of age or weighing less than 4 kg.
Though rare, seizures may occur in dogs treated with Reconcile.
Treatment should be stopped if seizures occur.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-administration, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
In humans, the most common symptoms associated with overdose include seizures, somnolence, nausea, tachycardia, and vomiting.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
To minimize the risk of adverse reactions, the recommended dose should not be exceeded.
Reported adverse reactions in dogs include:
- Very common adverse events: decreased appetite (including anorexia); lethargy.
- Common adverse events: urinary tract disorders (cystitis, urinary incontinence, urinary retention,
stranguria); central nervous system signs (incoordination, disorientation).
- Uncommon adverse events: weight loss/ loss of condition; mydriasis.
- Rare adverse events: seizures.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation, thus the use is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation.
Laboratory studies in rats and rabbits have not produced any evidence of a teratogenic, foetotoxic or maternotoxic effect.
No effect on the reproductive capacity in male and female rats was noted.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Reconcile tablets should not be given concomitantly with veterinary medicinal products that lower the seizure threshold (e. g. phenothiazines such as acepromazine or chlorpromazine).
Do not use in conjunction with other serotonergic agents (e. g. sertraline) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) [e. g., selegiline hydrochloride (L-deprenyl), amitraz] or tricyclic amines (TCAs) (e. g. amitriptyline and clomipramine).
A 6-week washout interval should be observed following discontinuation of therapy with Reconcile tablets prior to the administration of any veterinary medicinal product that may adversely interact with fluoxetine or its metabolite, norfluoxetine.
Fluoxetine is largely metabolised by the P-450 enzyme system, although the precise isoform in dogs is unknown.
Therefore, fluoxetine should be used with caution with other drugs.
3/ 33 4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Reconcile tablets should be administered orally at a once daily dose of 1 to 2 mg/ kg bodyweight according to the dosage table below:
Body weight (kg)
Tablet strength (mg)
Number of tablets per day
4- 8
Reconcile 8 mg tablet
1
> 8-16
Reconcile 16 mg tablet
1
> 16-32 > 32-64
Reconcile 32 mg tablet Reconcile 64 mg tablet
1 1
Clinical improvement with Reconcile tablets is expected within 1 to 2 weeks.
If no improvement is noted within 4 weeks, case management should be re-evaluated.
Clinical studies have shown that a beneficial response has been demonstrated for up to 8 weeks treatment with fluoxetine.
Reconcile tablets may be given with or without food.
Reconcile tablets are flavoured and most dogs will consume the tablet when offered by the owner.
If a dose is missed, the next scheduled dose should be administered as prescribed.
At the end of treatment it is not necessary to taper or reduce doses because of the long half life of this product.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
At doses in excess of the recommended dose, observed side effects at the therapeutic dose, including seizures, are exacerbated.
In addition, aggressive behaviour was observed.
In clinical studies these side effects were stopped immediately upon intravenous administration of a standard dose of diazepam.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Not applicable.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).
ATCvet code:
QN06AB03
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Fluoxetine and its active metabolite nor-fluoxetine have been shown to be highly selective inhibitors of serotonin uptake both in vitro and in vivo.
Fluoxetine does not act as a sedative.
Fluoxetine inhibits catecholamine uptake only at high concentrations in vitro and has no effect on catecholamine uptake in vivo at doses that are used to inhibit serotonin uptake.
As a result of inhibiting serotonin uptake, fluoxetine enhances serotonergic neurotransmission and produces functional effects resulting from increased activation of serotonin receptors.
Fluoxetine lacks any significant affinity for neurotransmitter receptors, including the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, α adrenergic receptors, or histaminergic H1 receptors, and does not have direct effects on the heart.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Fluoxetine is well absorbed after oral administration (~72%) and the absorption is not affected by feeding.
Fluoxetine is metabolised to norfluoxetine, an equipotent SSRI that contributes to the efficacy the product.
4/ 33 In a 21 day study, fluoxetine was administered daily at a dose of 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/ kg to laboratory Beagles.
The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) for fluoxetine were approximately dose proportional between 0.75 and 1.5 mg/ kg, with a greater than dose proportional increase at 3 mg/ kg.
After administration, fluoxetine readily appeared in plasma with mean Tmax values ranging from 1.25 to 1.75 hours on day 1 and from 2.5 to 2.75 hours on day 21.
Plasma levels readily declined with mean t½ values ranging from 4.6 to 5.7 hours on day 1 and from 5.1 to 10.1 on day 21.
Norfluoxetine plasma levels slowly appeared in plasma and were slowly eliminated with t½ values ranging from 44.2 to 48.9 hours on day 21.
Norfluoxetine Cmax and AUC were generally dose proportional but these values were 3 to 4 hold higher on day 21 than on Day 1.
Accumulation of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine occurred following multiple doses until reaching a steady-state within approximately 10 days.
Following the last dose administration, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma levels declined steadily in a log-linear fashion.
Elimination studies in dogs have shown that 29.8% and 44% of the dose was excreted in urine and faeces, respectively by 14 days following dosing.
