EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
BTVPUR ALSAP 8
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is BTVPUR AlSap 8?
BTVPUR AlSap 8 is a vaccine.
It is a suspension for injection that contains inactivated (killed) bluetongue serotype 8 viruses.
What is BTVPUR AlSap 8 used for?
BTVPUR AlSap 8 is used in cattle and sheep to protect them against bluetongue disease.
Bluetongue disease is an infection that is transmitted by midges and caused by the bluetongue virus (serotype 8).
The vaccine is used to limit viraemia (the presence of viruses in the blood) and reduce the signs of the disease.
The vaccine is given to young animals as an injection under the skin.
One injection is enough to vaccinate sheep, but cattle will need a second injection three to four weeks later.
The first injection is given at one month of age in animals that have never been exposed to the disease, and at two-and-a- half months if the animal’ s mother is already immune to the disease.
The vaccine will only be used as part of an approved national disease control programme.
This is because control of bluetongue is the responsibility of national veterinary authorities in consultation with the European Commission
How does BTVPUR AlSap 8 work?
BTVPUR AlSap 8 is a vaccine.
Vaccines work by ‘ teaching’ the immune system (the body’ s natural defences) how to defend itself against a disease.
BTVPUR AlSap 8 contains bluetongue viruses that have been inactivated so that they cannot cause the disease.
When it is given to cattle and sheep, the animals’ immune systems recognise the viruses as ‘ foreign ’ and make antibodies against the virus.
In the future, if the animals are exposed to the bluetongue virus, the immune system will be able to produce antibodies more quickly.
This will help to protect against the disease.
BTVPUR AlSap 8 contains bluetongue viruses of one type (‘ serotype 8’).
The vaccine also contains ‘ adjuvants’ (aluminium hydroxide and saponin) to stimulate a better response.

How has BTVPUR AlSap 8 been studied?
The safety of the vaccine was studied in laboratory safety studies carried out with BTVPUR AlSap 8 in cattle and sheep.
Results from a series of laboratory safety trials performed with vaccines of similar composition but of different bluetongue serotypes were also presented in order to extrapolate safety conclusions, as the vaccine is intended for use in an emergency situation.
The efficacy of the vaccine in cattle was studied in a laboratory trial using the vaccine in cattle from one month of age.
Another laboratory study looked at the use of the vaccine in sheep aged three to four months.
The company also presented results from a series of studies with other vaccines that contain other serotypes of the bluetongue virus, as well as published information to show how the vaccine will also work in younger sheep.
The vaccine was assessed in the context of an emergency situation which means that further studies with BTVPUR AlSap 8 are still ongoing and will be assessed.
What benefit has BTVPUR AlSap 8 shown during the studies?
The studies showed that the vaccine is safe for sheep and cattle and that it reduces the signs of the disease and viraemia in animals from one month of age that are infected with bluetongue virus serotype 8.
The studies also showed that the vaccine can be used in pregnant sheep.
The safety of the vaccine in pregnant cows is not yet fully established, but results to date show that the vaccine can be used safely at least during the last three months of pregnancy.
What is the risk associated with BTVPUR AlSap 8?
After vaccination, there can be a small swelling at the injection site lasting up to two weeks.
Animals may also show a temporary increase in body temperature, usually of no more than 1ºC, in the 24 hours after vaccination.
What is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption (withdrawal period)?
The withdrawal period for both sheep and cattle is zero days.
What is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption?
Milk can be taken after zero days for both sheep and cattle.
Why has BTVPUR AlSap 8 been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of BTVPUR AlSap 8 exceed the risks for active immunisation of sheep and cattle to prevent infection, viraemia and clinical signs caused by the bluetongue virus serotype 8, and recommended that BTVPUR AlSap 8 should be given a Marketing Authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
BTVPUR AlSap 8 has been authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’.
This means that it has not been possible to obtain complete information about BTVPUR AlSap 8.
Every year, the European
Page 2/ 3 Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review additional information that will become available according to an agreed timetable and this summary will be updated as necessary.
What information is still awaited for BTVPUR Alsap 8?
The company that makes BTVPUR Alsap 8 will submit an action plan together with timelines for all of the issues that need to be resolved before the authorisation can revert to normal status.
It will also supply regular updates on the use and the safety of the vaccine.
