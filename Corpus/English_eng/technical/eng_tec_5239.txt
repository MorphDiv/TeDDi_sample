PHP supports' C', 'C++ 'and Unix shell-style comments.
For example:
?php echo "This is a test"; / / This is a one-line c+ + style comment / * This is a multi line comment yet another line of comment * / echo "This is yet another test"; echo "One Final Test"; # This is shell-style style comment?
The "one-line" comment styles actually only comment to the end of the line or the current block of PHP code, whichever comes first.
h1 This is an ?php # echo "simple";? example. / h1 p The header above will say'This is an example '.
You should be careful not to nest 'C' style comments, which can happen when commenting out large blocks.
?php / * echo "This is a test"; / * This comment will cause a problem * / * /?
The one-line comment styles actually only comment to the end of the line or the current block of PHP code, whichever comes first.
This means that HTML code after / /?
WILL be printed:? skips out of the PHP mode and returns to HTML mode, and / / cannot influence that.
