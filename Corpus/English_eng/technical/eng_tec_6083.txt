Introduction
File operations
About palette files
The palette files installed by & kde; can be either system-wide or the user ones. The latter are in you private & kde; configuration folders, and they are named Custom Colors and Recent Colors.
In & kcoloredit;, you may open all of these palettes, as well as palettes in arbitrary files.
Opening a file
In the Open File dialog, you may choose from a list of installed palettes, or browse folders for files.
Editing
Cursor
The cursor is visible as a line in the palette view. It can be moved by clicking on an area beside a color.
The cursor has the following functions:
It points to the color after it. The color, if any, is described below the palette view. You may edit its name there.
It can be used to make a selection. A selection can be made by clicking on an area beside a color, so to move the cursor there, and by moving the mouse then with the left mouse button pressed.
If the At cursor check-box near the Add Color button is checked, a color from the color chooser is put at the cursor. The color is either inserted or it overwrites another one, depending on whether the Overwrite mode is chosen. The mode can be chosen by checking the Overwrite check-box, that is next to the At cursor one.
Selection
A selection, that can be made as it was written in the previous section, can be used with the copy, cut and paste operations.
Clipboard format
& kcoloredit; uses the following format for clipboard data: for each color three numbers for red, green and blue components, respectively, and an optional color name, followed by a new line character if there is another color. Therefore, if for example three numbers are in the clipboard, they can be pasted by & kcoloredit; as a color.
Selecting a color from an RGB space
A color can be selected from an RGB space in & kcoloredit; in the following ways:
By editing the HSV or RGB components.
By selecting a color from color gradient panels. In the left one, two from HSV components can be selected, and in the right one, the third one. The third component can be chosen by clicking on one of the buttons labeled H:, S: and V:. The one component panel display colors with the other two components equal to these selected in the two components panel. The two components panel may display colors with the third component fixed, or, if the Variable check-box is set, with a value equal to the one selected in the one component panel. In the Replace mode, the color selected in panels replaces the output one instantly, and in the Change: mode it modifies the output color after each click, or a mouse move while a mouse button is pressed. Therefore, in the latter mode the color selected in the gradient panels may be different from the output color. To synchronize the colors, the Synchronize button can be used.
Drag and drop
The palette colors and the color selection output color can be dragged with a mouse.
