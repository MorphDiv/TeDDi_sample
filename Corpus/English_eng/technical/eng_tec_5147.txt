(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
Sets the base URI for all XSLT transformations, the base URI is used with Xpath instructions to resolve document() and other commands which access external resources.
It is also used to resolve URIs for the xsl:include and xsl:import elements.
As of 4.3, the default base URI is the directory of the executing script.
In effect, it is the directory name value of the __FILE__ constant.
Prior to 4.3, the default base URI was less predictable.
Note:
Please note that file: / / is needed in front of path if you use Windows.
