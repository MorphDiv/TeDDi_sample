Generating HTML
& kphotoalbum; offers two possibilities for generating HTML from your photo album. One is the implementation build into & kphotoalbum;, the other is available as an plugin (see). This section will describe the build in version, which you may find in the menubar File Generate HTML
Before HTML pages are generated, you need to specify a bit of information, split over the three pages Content, Layout and Destination. The following section describes each page in detail.
The Content page
In the content page you specify which information should be generated to the HTML pages.
First you specify the title of the overview pages, plus a description generated on these pages. See kphotoalbum; example HTML pages to see an example of this.
Next you specify whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be generated, and put on the overview page. See for details on export files.
Finally you may specify which information should be generated on the HTML pages. This way you may skip generating information which might be obvious to the reader of the pages (say these images was from the party we all attended). Notice, & kphotoalbum; does currently not allow you to exclude certain categories from the export file, so do n't rely on this as a way of excluding information you do not want readers of your pages to see.
The Layout page
On the layout page you specify what your HTML pages should look like. Most of the options on this page are straight forward, and do not need further description here.
At the bottom of this page it is possible to specify several resolution for images. This way people reading your pages are not forced to download images in large resolutions, say 1600x1200, just to see it on a monitor not offering more than say 800x600.
At any time your readers may change resolution among those you specified. That way they may browse through your images in low resolution (and thus fast download time), and when they see an image of special interest, they may change to high resolution.
The Destination page
On the destination page you specify several directories and URL's specifying where your pages goes.
The philosophy is that you specify a base directory for all your generations, and for each generation specify a new subdirectory.
First you need to specify the base directory for all your images. This directory will be remembered from session to session, and allows you to once and for all tell where all subsequent images should go. Here you may specify a directory, or any protocol supported by KDE. Examples includes:
ftp: / /someserver/ my-upload-area/ images (upload using FTP)
fish: / /someserver/ home/ foo/ images (upload using ssh)
smb: / /someserver/ c/ images (upload to a Windows share)
Once you are done generating your images, you may want to check whether they are really available to your audience. If you specify a URL in the Base URL line edit, a web browser will be spawned once HTML pages has been generated. The URL you specify here should match the directory you specified above. Thus the web browser will be started on the subdirectories of this URL.
Once you have generated HTML pages, your pages may still not be in their final destination, you may still need special upload procedures out of the control of & kphotoalbum;. For the Import feature (see) to work, you need to specify the final destination of the pages. Again this does not include the subdirectory of the current generation.
The three line edits described above are all base directories and base URL's. At these locations a new subdirectory will be created named with the name you specify in Output Directory.
