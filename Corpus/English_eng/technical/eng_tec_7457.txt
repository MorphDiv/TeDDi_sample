2 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Dogs should be carefully monitored and treatment might need to be adjusted or discontinued, if necessary.
Monitoring of renal function Renal function should be adequately monitored every month using dipstick urine testing.
In case of positive semiquantitative dipstick results (protein > 30 mg/ dl), urinalysis should be performed to determine urinary protein creatinine (UPC) ratio, and a blood sample to measure creatinine, albumin and BUN.
If UPC ratio > 2, or creatinine > 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN), or albumin < 0.75 lower limit of normal (LLN) or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 1.5 ULN, discontinue treatment.
Monitoring of Protein loss syndrome Perform every month a dipstick urine test.
In case of positive semi-quantitative dipstick results (protein ≥ 30 mg/ dL), perform urinalysis to determine urinary protein creatinine (UPC) ratio.
Perform every month a blood measurement of albumin.
In case of UPC ratio > 2 or albumin < 0.75 lower limit of normal (LLN), treatment should be interrupted until albumin and UPC values have returned to limit value (UPC ratio < 2 and albumin > 0.75 LLN), treatment can then be continued at the same dose.
If of one of these events (UPC ratio > 2 or albumin < 0.75 LLN) occurs for a second time, treatment should be permanently discontinued.
Anaemia and / or haemolysis Dogs should be carefully monitored for signs of (haemolytic) anaemia.
In case of clinical signs of anaemia or haemolysis, haemoglobin, free bilirubin and haptoglobin should be measured and blood cell counts (including reticulocyte) should be performed.
Treatment should be discontinued in case of:
Haemolytic anaemia, i. e. haemoglobin< 10 g/dL and haemolysis, i.e. free bilirubin > 1.5 ULN and haptoglobin < 0.1 g/dL, Anaemia due to lack of regeneration, i.e. haemoglobin< 10 g/dL and reticulocytes < 80,000/mm3.
Hepatic toxicity (ALT or AST elevation), neutropenia In case of an increase of ALT or AST > 3 ULN, decrease of neutrophil count < 2000/ mm3 or any other severe adverse events, treatment should be modified as follows:
At the first occurrence, treatment should be interrupted until resolution, then resumed at the same dose level; At the second occurrence of the same event, treatment should be interrupted until resolution; treatment should then be continued with a reduced dose of 9 mg/ kg bodyweight/ day; At the third occurrence of the same event, treatment should be interrupted until resolution; treatment should then be continued with a dose further reduced to 6 mg/ kg/ day; Treatment should be discontinued, if severe adverse reactions are still encountered at the 6 mg/ kg/ day dose.
Other precautions
Treatment should be permanently discontinued in case of renal toxicity, immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) and/ or anaemia due to lack of regeneration, and if severe neutropenia, and/ or severe diarrhoea and/ or severe vomiting persist after dose reduction.
Dogs should not be used for breeding while under treatment.

Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Repeated dermal contact with masitinib may impair female fertility and foetal development.
The active substance of Masivet can cause skin sensitisation. • Avoid skin contact with faeces, urine, and vomit of treated dogs. • Wear protective gloves while disposing of vomit, urine or faeces of treated dogs. • If broken tablets, vomit, urine or faeces of treated dogs come into contact with the skin, rinse immediately with plenty of water.
The active substance of Masivet can cause severe eye-irritation and serious damage to the eyes. • Avoid contact with the eyes. • Take care not to touch the eyes before gloves have been removed and disposed of and the hands have been thoroughly washed. • If the product comes into contact with the eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water.
People with known hypersensitivity to masitinib should not handle the product.
4 In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Do not eat, drink, or smoke when treating the dog.
Children should not have close contact to treated dogs, treated dog faeces or vomit.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Very common
Mild to moderate gastrointestinal reactions (diarrhoea and vomiting) with a mean duration of approximately 21 and 9 days, respectively.
Mild to moderate alopecia with a mean duration of approximately 26 days.
Common
Severe renal toxicity may occur in dogs suffering from renal disorders at the start of treatment (including high blood creatinine level or proteinuria).
Moderate to severe anaemia (aplastic/ haemolytic) with a mean duration of approximately 7 days.
Protein-loss syndrome (mainly due to a decrease in serum albumin).
Mild or moderate neutropenia with a mean duration of approximately 24 days.
Increase in aminotransferase (ALT or AST) with a mean duration of approximately 29 days.
Specific measures to be taken in case of the above reactions are described in section 4.5.
Other commonly observed adverse reactions were in most cases mild or moderate:
Lethargy and asthenia with a mean duration of approximately 8 and 40 days, respectively Decrease in appetite or anorexia with a mean duration of 45 days and 18 days, respectively.
Cough (mean duration 23 days).
Lymphadenopathy (mean duration 47 days).
Oedema (mean duration of oedema was 7 days).
Lipoma (mean duration 53 days).
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in pregnant or lactating bitches.
Laboratory studies in rats have shown evidence of impaired female fertility at dose of 100 mg/ kg/ day, embryotoxicity and developmental toxicity at dose above 30 mg/ kg/ day.
Studies in rabbits did however not reveal embryotoxicity or developmental toxicity.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In vitro tests with human microsomes demonstrate that concomitant treatment with substances which are metabolised by CYP450 isoforms may result in higher or lower plasma levels of either masitinib or those substances.
No corresponding information is available for dogs.
Hence, caution is advised with the concurrent use of masitinib and other substances.
Concurrent use of other substances with a high degree of protein binding may compete with masitinib binding and thus cause adverse effects.
The efficacy of Masivet might be reduced in dogs previously treated with chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy.
No information relating to potential cross-resistance with other cytostatic products is available.
5 4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For oral use.
The recommended dose is 12.5 mg/ kg (with a dose range of 11-14 mg/ kg) once daily as presented in the table below.
In dogs with a bodyweight of less than 15 kg accurate dosing is not always possible.
These dogs may be treated with either 50, 100 or 150 mg, if it is feasible to achieve a target dose of 11-14 mg/ kg bw.
The tablets must be administered as a whole and should not be divided, broken or ground.

If the tablet is regurgitated or vomited within 10 minutes following administration, treatment should be repeated.
If the tablet is regurgitated or vomited later than 10 minutes following administration, treatment should not be repeated.
The treatment should be reviewed after 4 to 6 weeks in order to assess the initial response.
Duration of treatment depends on the response to treatment.
Treatment should be maintained in the case of stable disease, i. e. static, partial or complete tumour response, provided that the product is sufficiently well tolerated.
In case of tumour progression, treatment is unlikely to be successful and the treatment should be reviewed.
Dose Reduction, treatment interruption and treatment discontinuation:
Dogs should be monitored carefully and professional judgement should be used to determine the need for dose reduction in the event of possible significant adverse reactions (see section 4.5).
Doses can be reduced to 9 mg/ kg bodyweight (range 7.5 – 10.5 mg/ kg) or 6 mg/ kg bw (range 4.5 – 7.5) according to the tables below.
During clinical studies, the daily dose was decreased due to adverse events in approximately 16% of treated dogs and mainly due to an increase in transaminases.

4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
The recommended daily dose of 12.5 mg/ kg body weight corresponds to the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) that was derived from repeat dose toxicity studies in healthy Beagle dogs.
Overdosing signs were observed in toxicity studies conducted in healthy dogs, treated for 39 weeks at doses of around 2 times the recommended dose (25 mg masitinib), treated for 13 weeks and 4 weeks at doses of around 3 times the recommended dose (41.7 mg masitinib), and treated for 4 weeks at doses of around 10 times the recommended dose (125 mg masitinib).
The main target organs of toxicity in dogs are the gastrointestinal tract, the haematopoetic system, the kidney and the liver.
In case of adverse events following overdose, treatment should be discontinued until resolution, and then resumed at the recommended therapeutic dose level.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ATCvet code:
QL01XE90
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Masitinib is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which, in vitro, potently and selectively inhibits the mutated form, in the juxtamembrane (JM) region, of the c-kit receptor.
It also inhibits the Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) receptor and the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR3).
In the pivotal clinical field study, dogs of various breeds, ranging in age from two to seventeen years, were randomly treated with Masivet at a dose of 12.5 mg/ kg or with a placebo.
In dogs with non- resectable mast cell tumours, Grade 2 or 3, expressing a mutated tyrosine kinase c-kit receptor, treatment with Masivet showed a significantly longer Time-to-Tumour Progression (TTP) with a median of 241 days as compared to 83 days for placebo.
Response to treatment with masitinib was expressed as stable disease; i. e. static, partial or complete response.
Masitinib treatment should only be used in dogs with non-resectable mast cell tumours, which express the mutated c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor.
The presence of a mutated tyrosine kinase c-kit receptor must be confirmed prior to treatment.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Following oral administration in dogs at a dose of 11.2 mg (0.5) per kg of bodyweight, masitinib is rapidly absorbed and the time to maximal concentration (Tmax) is approximately 2 hours.
The elimination half-life (t½) is approximately 3-6 hours.
Masitinib is approximately 93% bound to plasma proteins.
Masitinib is metabolised predominantly by N-dealkylation.
Excretion takes place in the bile.

ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
How should I administer Masivet to my dog, and for how long?
Tablets should always be administered in the same manner, with food.
The tablets must be administered as a whole and should not be divided, broken or ground.
If a broken tablet is rejected by the dog after chewing, it should be disposed of.
If a dose is missed, the next schedule dose should be given as prescribed.
Do not increase or double the dose.
If more than the prescribed amount of tablets were given, contact your veterinarian.
Duration of treatment will be dependent on the response observed.
Treatment should be maintained in the case of stable disease, i.e. static, partial or complete tumour response, provided that the product is sufficiently well tolerated.
In case of tumour progression, efficacy of treatment is unlikely to be successful and the treatment should be reviewed.
The treatment should be reviewed after 4 to 6 weeks in order to assess the initial response.
Long term treatment should be under regular (at least monthly) veterinary control.
25 Can other medications be given while my dog is taking Masivet?
There are some medicines that you should not give to your dog during treatment because together, they might cause serious adverse effects.
Concurrent use of other substances with a high degree of protein binding may compete with masitinib binding and thus cause adverse effects.
Concurrent use of substances which are metabolised by CYP450 isoforms may result in higher or lower plasma levels of either masitinib or those substances.
Tell your veterinarian about all medicines, including over-the-counter products, that you intend to administer to your dog.
The efficacy of Masivet might be reduced in dogs previously treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
No information relating to potential cross-resistance with other cytostatic products is available.

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
12.1 Special precautions for use:
What are the special precautions for my dog?
Dogs should be carefully monitored by your veterinarian (at least every month) and treatment might need to be adjusted or discontinued, if necessary.
The treatment should be discontinued if any of these signs are observed: anaemia, severe neutropenia, severe renal toxicity, hepatic toxicity and/or severe diarrhoea or vomiting persistent after dose reduction.
Dogs should not be used for breeding while under treatment.
What are the special precautions to be taken by the person administering Masivet?
Repeated dermal contact with masitinib may impair female fertility and foetal development.
The active substance of Masivet can cause skin sensitisation. • Avoid skin contact with faeces, urine, and vomit of treated dogs. • Wear protective gloves while disposing of vomit, urine or faeces of treated dogs. • If broken tablets, vomit, urine or faeces of treated dogs come into contact with the skin, rinse immediately with plenty of water.
The active substance of Masivet can cause severe eye-irritation and serious damage to the eyes. • Avoid contact with the eyes. • Take care not to touch the eyes before gloves have been removed and disposed of and the hands have been thoroughly washed. • If the product comes into contact with the eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water.
People with known hypersensitivity to masitinib should not handle the product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Do not eat, drink, or smoke when treating the dog.
Children should not have close contact to treated dogs, treated dog faeces or vomit.

OTHER INFORMATION
For animal treatment only.
The tablets are available in pack sizes of 30 tablets.
Masivet is a prescription medicine used to treat dog mast cell tumours.
Mast cell tumours are cancerous proliferations of mast cells.
It is a heterogeneous disease which can be relatively innocent or aggressively malignant.
In certain circumstances, mast cell tumours can be life threatening for your dog.
Masivet might extend the time before the tumours progress.
Special information for the veterinarian
Dogs should be monitored carefully and professional judgement should be used to determine the need for dose reduction in the event of possible significant adverse reactions.
Monitoring of renal function Renal function should be adequately monitored every month using dipstick urine testing.
In case of positive semiquantitative dipstick results (protein > 30 mg/dl), urinalysis should be performed to determine urinary protein creatinine (UPC) ratio, and a blood sample to measure creatinine, albumin and BUN.
If UPC ratio > 2, or creatinine > 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN), or albumin < 0.75 lower limit of normal (LLN) or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 1.5 ULN, discontinue treatment.
Monitoring of Protein loss syndrome Perform every month a dipstick urine test.
In case of positive semi-quantitative dipstick results (protein ≥ 30 mg/dL), perform urinalysis to determine urinary protein creatinine (UPC) ratio.
Perform every month a blood measurement of albumin.
In case of UPC ratio > 2 or albumin < 0.75 lower limit of normal (LLN), treatment should be interrupted until albumin and UPC values have returned to limit value (UPC ratio < 2 and albumin > 0.75 LLN), treatment can then be continued at the same dose.
If of one of these events (UPC ratio > 2 or albumin < 0.75 LLN) occurs for a second time, treatment should be permanently discontinued.
27 Anaemia and / or haemolysis Dogs should be carefully monitored for signs of (haemolytic) anaemia.
In case of clinical signs of anaemia or haemolysis, haemoglobin, free bilirubin and haptoglobin should be measured and blood cell counts (including reticulocyte) should be performed.
Treatment should be discontinued in case of:
Haemolytic anaemia, i.e. haemoglobin < 10 g/dL and haemolysis, i.e. free bilirubin > 1.5 ULN and haptoglobin < 0.1 g/dL, Anaemia due to lack of regeneration, i.e. haemoglobin < 10 g/dL and reticulocytes < 80,000/mm3.
Hepatic toxicity (ALT or AST elevation), neutropenia In case of an increase of ALT or AST > 3 ULN, decrease of neutrophil count < 2000/mm3 or any other severe adverse events, treatment should be modified as follows:
At the first occurrence, treatment should be interrupted until resolution, then resumed at the same dose level; At the second occurrence of the same event, treatment should be interrupted until resolution; treatment should then be continued with a reduced dose of 9 mg/kg bodyweight/day; At the third occurrence of the same event, treatment should be interrupted until resolution; treatment should then be continued with a dose further reduced to 6 mg/kg/day; Treatment should be discontinued, if severe adverse reactions are still encountered at the 6 mg/kg/day dose.
