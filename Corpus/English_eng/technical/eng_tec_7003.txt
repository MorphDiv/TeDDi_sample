Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ;)
FAQ
If you have problems with & krusader; please check the Installation procedure, as your problem may be caused by a bad installation.
The & FAQ; is divided into three sections: Installation & FAQ; (this page) Usage & FAQ; (issues with running/ using & krusader;) General & FAQ; (bug reports, forum, mailing list,...) If you feel that a & FAQ; is missing or if something is not clear to you, please let us know.
Installation & FAQ;
Does & krusader; need & kde; to run?
No, & krusader; does not need the & kde; window manager to run on your computer but & krusader; 's natural environment is & kde;, because it relies on services provided by the & kde; base libraries. Only some shared libraries are needed & eg; & kde; libraries, & Qt; libraries, & etc; This means that & krusader; runs on GNOME, AfterStep, XFce and other window managers provided the appropriate libraries are installed on your computer. All this is not a problem since the apt-get world can resolve these dependencies instantly.
You do not need to switch to the & kde; window manager to use & krusader;; you can still use GNOME, AfterStep, XFce or another window manager. However, the configuration of the & krusader; fonts and some behavior is done by running kcontrol.
A lot depends on what you want to do with & krusader;. You should know that & krusader; uses the & kde; KIO Slaves to access remote file systems, and support for only a limited number of file system types are shipped with & kde; libraries, most of the KIO Slave are bundled with & kde; base (including fish, sftp and tar). However, if you want the property-dialog to show EXIF-data for. jpeg's, you need & kde; graphics. If you want ID3-infos, you need & kde; multimedia, and so on.
To summarize, if you want a working & krusader; - install & kde; libs. If you want a functional & krusader; then you need & kde; libs + & kde; base. For maximum functionality, & krusader; needs all of the & kde; package libraries, but the & kde; window manager is optional.
Which libraries does & krusader; need to run?
For running & krusader; (eg; when you have installed & krusader; with a binary RPM) you need less libraries than if you compile & krusader; from source. & eg; you only need the C-compiler & gcc; when you compile & krusader; from source (see the next question).
Take a look at the Krusader dependencies paragraph of our install chapter.
If you need more details please take a look at the Krusader requirements on Ubuntu. The "depends" are required, the "suggests" make Krusader more powerful.
I have followed all the steps but make complains about missing libs or headers. What do I need to do?
Install the missing packages.
Take a look at the Compilation requirements paragraph of our install chapter.
Most RPM-based distributions separate the headers from the libs. The headers are needed to compile & krusader;. Look for packages in the form foo-devel-*. rpm (eg; kdelibs-devel-foo. i586. rpm) or foo-dev-*. deb for Debian based distributions. These are usually included with your distribution.
If you cannot find the needed package, use rpmfind and click'missing lib or header 'in the search line. Or use apt-cache search foo to find the corresponding package for Debian based distributions.
How do I compile & krusader; when I'm using a 64 bit processor?
As far as we know, there are no issues. & krusader; is also available on many other architectures.
I have downloaded the Source RPM krusader-x. xx. dist. src. rpm, what to do now?
Check the ownership and the permissions on / usr/ src/ RPM/ and all recursive directories that your normal user can read-write-execute in these directories.
To produce the binary RPM for your computer, do this:
$rpm --rebuild lt; /path/ to/ rpmfile/ gt; krusader-x. xx. dist. src. rpm
If all dependencies are OK, a binary RPM krusader-x. xx. dist. rpm will be created at / usr/ src/ RPM/ RPMS/ i586 (replace i586 with your architecture).
Test the binary RPM for errors before installing: $rpm -i --test lt; /path/ to/ rpmfilegt; krusader-x. xx. dist. rpm If the prompt returns without any message, then everything is OK.
Install the binary RPM as usual, for example: $su -c'rpm -Uvh lt; /path/ to/ rpmfilegt; krusader-x. xx. dist. rpm 'You will be asked to enter your root password.
Now you can start & krusader;.
For more information about RPM, visit rpm. org and read the RPM Guide by Eric Foster-Johnson.
I'm trying to install binary foo (RPM or DEB package), but it fails. What's wrong?
Since we only prepare (and use) the source, we have no way of knowing this. Did you test the binary RPM before installing? $rpm -i --test lt; /path/ to/ rpmfilegt; krusader-x. xx. dist. rpm If the prompt returns without any message, then everything is OK. RPM's downloaded from our website are usually provided by & krusader; users. Visit your distro website and search for an updated RPM.
If the RPM is not OK, try to find another package at & Linux; software archives such as freshmeat. net or KDE-APPS. org. If you still cannot find the appropriate package for your & Linux; distribution, we recommend searching for it with rpmfind or rpmpbone.
In general, a package for an older version of your distribution or even for another distribution might work on your computer (eg; FC RPM's often work on Mdk and RH, and vice versa), but it is always the best that you install only RPM's that exactly match your distribution. If you cannot find a package that matches your distribution version, architecture or distribution, then use a source RPM. When you use a source RPM, the Krusader sources will be built, on your computer, guaranteeing a suitable binary RPM for your specific distribution and architecture. In addition, this method results in maximum system speed, since the resulting binary is customized for your computer. Please read the previous question, it explains how to install a source RPM. The best solution is explained in the next question.
I cannot find an RPM or DEB package for & krusader;, what to do?
Check if your distribution provides & krusader;, if it does n't then contact your distribution creator and ask them to include & krusader;!
Did you take a look at the & URL; 's on the Installation procedure page? If you have and found nothing, you can always compile & krusader; from source. Even if you feel you have n't got the necessary skills, you will probably succeed in compiling & krusader;: we provide a very detailed installation procedure. This HowTo enables newcomers to compile & krusader; from source, even if they have never done a compilation from source before, just follow the instructions carefully. Feel free to post a help request if you encounter problems.
I've installed & krusader;, but when I start, only the "Help" menu appears. Why?
In this case only the Help menu is visible and all other menu items like & eg; File and Select are missing. This is because some distributions put the krusaderui. rc file in the wrong directory. To solve the problem, just copy the krusaderui. rc file from the package krusader_kde3/ krusader/ krusaderui. rc to $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ krusader/ krusaderui. rc and ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ krusader/ krusaderui. rc and re-run & krusader;. If you have compiled & krusader; from sources this is often caused if the KDEDIR - QTDIR environment variables are not correctly set. The result is that the krusaderui. rc file is installed in the wrong directory. Please read the following question, as well.
Some new menu items are missing after updating & krusader;, what's wrong?
The krusaderui. rc file is stored in $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ krusader/ krusaderui. rc. When you change the "Toolbar", & kde; makes a copy of that file in the home folder at ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ krusader/ krusaderui. rc. If Krusader was previously installed on your computer, and you install a newer & krusader; version the ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ krusader/ krusaderui. rc file must be replaced with the newer version. Note: this will also reset all your changes on toolbars and shortcuts!
The first line of krusaderui. rc contains the version number. After installing a newer & krusader; version, & kde; will automatically replace the old ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ krusader/ krusaderui. rc with the newer version when starting the new & krusader; for the first time (kde; will detect the newer version number in the first line).
If you install a CVS or beta version and & krusader; was already installed on your computer then you should delete the krusaderui. rc file from your home directory to activate the new menu entries $rm ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ krusader/ krusaderui. rc
If the ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ krusader/ krusaderui. rc file is older, then the new menu elements will not be shown. Read the previous question for information on how to update the krusaderui. rc file. If krusaderui. rc is missing or in a wrong directory, only the "Help" menu appears, please read the previous question.
I have a libGLcore. so.1 compile error after using the NVIDIA installer, what to do?
This problem occurs when you use the NVIDIA installer and not the official NVIDIA packages of your distribution. & krusader; is based on & Qt; which can be linked against the X OpenGL libraries. As a result & krusader; may look for OpenGL as well. The problem is that the NVIDIA installer (prior to version 7xxx) does n't perform it's task properly: it replaces the OpenGL header files (which get included into & krusader;) but does n't set the libGL links correctly. The best solution is to use the NVIDIA packages provided by your distributor or a new NVIDIA installer, the current version at the moment of writing is 7114. If, for some reason, you must use an old NVIDIA driver, one solution is the following hack, the exact commands depend on the distribution used and the version of the NVIDIA driver (6111 in this example), but it should read something like this:
$ln -s libGLcore. so.1.0.6111 libGLcore. so.0 $ln -s libGLcore. so.1.0.6111 libGLcore. so $ln -s libGLcore. so.1.0.6111 libGLcore. so.1.0.0 $ln -s libGLcore. so.1.0.6111 libGLcore. so.0.0.0 $ln -s libGLcore. so.1.0.6111 libGL. so $ln -s libGLcore. so.1.0.6111 libGL. so.0 $ln -s libGLcore. so.1.0.6111 libGL. so.0.0.0 $ln -s libGLcore. so.1.0.6111 libGL. so.1 $ln -s libGLcore. so.1.0.6111 libGL. so.1.0.0 $ln -s / usr/ lib/ libGLU. la / usr/ X11R6/ lib/ libGLU. la
I am having trouble compiling and installing & krusader;, how do I send a help request?
Please read our detailed installation procedure and the FAQ. If you cannot find a solution to your problem then feel free to post a help request at our & krusader; forum or use the krusader; -users mailing list. But before posting a help request, please try the following:
Use the Search function on the krusader; Forum, your problem might be solved or discussed already.
If you cannot find a solution, please make a note of the following issues: the & krusader; version used the & Linux; distribution + version used a good description of the problem Without this information, it is very difficult for us to help you.
If you give us the error messages (eg; make error messages) please start with the FIRST error message, all the error messages which follow the first error message are consequences and not the cause of your problem.
Send out your help request.
Thank you for your co-operation!
How can I build an RPM package for & krusader;?
If you have experience with compiling from source, you will probably be able to build a & krusader; RPM too. Information about RPM can be found at rpm. org and in the RPM Guide by Eric Foster-Johnson. The following is the short procedure howto on building an RPM.
NEVER build RPMs when logged in as root. Mistakes in building packages (eg; a bad krusader. spec file) can do serious damage to your system when logged in as root.
Compile & krusader; from source to check that the compilation works fine.
Copy kusader-1. xx. tar. gz to / usr/ scr/ RPM/ SOURCE
Copy kusader. spec to / usr/ scr/ RPM/ SPECS Tip: the latest kusader. spec can be found in CVS.
Edit kusader. spec and add your name, your email address, the rpm name,... Other changes may be needed if rpmbuild fails.
Build the binary and the source RPM with: $rpmbuild -ba / usr/ scr/ RPM/ SPECS/ krusader. spec If everything went OK you will have a binary RPM in / usr/ src/ RPM/ RPMS/ i586 (depending on your architecture) and a source RPM in / usr/ src/ RPM/ SRPMS/ & eg; krusader-1.70-beta1. suse10. i586. rpm and krusader-1.70-beta1. suse10. src. rpm
If the build is not OK you will receive an error message during the rpmbuild process, try to fix it and run rpmbuild again.
And finally: test the RPM before sending it in.
Why does & krusader; -svn show an old version number in the about box?
Because we only change the version number just before we do a new release. & krusader; -svn will show an older version number, so ignore the version number and check the download date. We simply have n't yet decided what the next version number will be.
Usage & FAQ;
& krusader; keeps crashing, why?
We've been receiving a lot of emails and bug reports (December 2005) regarding random crashes, especially during file operations such as copy, move, & etc; These crashes are related to & Qt; 3.3.5 and NOT & krusader;. It seems that & Qt; 3.3.5 introduced a serious bug which is currently (December 2005) causing random crashes in many & kde; applications including & konqueror;. You can use Google to find out more. As far as we know, Debian -Sid and & SuSE; already posted new & Qt; binaries that fix the problem, and Gentoo has masked & Qt; 3.3.5 completely. As for now, you either need & Qt; 3.3.4 or a fixed & Qt; 3.3.5 or a higher version, depending on your distribution. More information is available on our website.
When I try to mount/ unmount my cdrom/ floppy, & krusader; reports something about a supermount, what's this about?
Supermount is a daemon which handles the mounting/ unmounting of removable file systems for you. Just insert a floppy, and do cd / mnt/ floppy supermount will do the mount for you automatically and transparently. Usually this works fine. However, supermount misleads the system into thinking that the floppy/ cdrom is mounted at all times! This creates some problems for & krusader;, as it cannot really know when the floppy or CD has been removed because the system information is not correctly updated by supermount - is there really a floppy in the drive? Of course, this can be solved, but as for now, we do n't consider it a priority.
Why does & krusader; freeze or hang on a dead mountpoint?
When & krusader; is & eg; browsing an NFS share and the NFS server goes down, & krusader; will freeze. This & krusader; (and all other open internal viewers/ editors) freeze is fatal, and can only be corrected with the kill -9. We have no solution for this. This is an issue not confined to file managers, or even the & Linux; OS! The problem is that you "hang" on the first access to the dead share - so there is no way around it, no check to avoid it, even ls will freeze. Just trying to read something - anything - is enough to get you stuck. The one and only way around this architectural problem is using a multi-threaded design - this way if we get stuck, we do n't hang the entire application event loop, but we do n't think that the time is right for adding threads, we are not sure that *all* the & kde; systems out there are using & Qt; -mt (the multi threaded version of the & Qt; library), and the Krusader Krew may not be the right people to address this major issue in any case; so currently this is just a bug we have to learn to live with.
When I try to resize & krusader; to make it smaller, I discover that I cannot resize it below a certain size. Why?
See the F1, F2 (etc;) buttons? They are not allowing & krusader; to downsize as they have a minimum size. Just disable them Settings Show FN Keys Bar and you'll be able to resize & krusader; to your liking. Since version 1.51 we have improved this greatly: when downsizing the buttons will look like'F5.. py '. When the button faces are too small to read a tooltip will give the complete text. The minimum width is 45 pixels for each button.
Samba ISO 8859-x codepage / What to do if & krusader; does not read shared directories containing special international characters?
& krusader; does not handle (yet) Samba ISO 8859-x codepages, if you use a codepage different than 8859-1 you will have to do a manual configuration. Create or modify the file: ~/. smb/ smb. conf [global] workgroup = MyWorkGroup (ex. WORKGROUP) client code page = MyCodePage (ex. 852) character set = MyCharSet (ex. ISO8859-2) Unfortunately kcontrol (kde; 3.1.1) fails to configure smb. conf properly, so this must be done manually with a text editor.
& krusader; reports "krarc:... protocol not supported" error at opening an archive file, what to do?
Install the krarc slave properly:
Copy the kio_krarc. so, kio_krarc. la files into $KDEDIR/ lib/ kde3
Copy the krarc. protocol file into $KDEDIR/ share/ services
or the directory where the KIO slaves are placed in your & Linux; distribution.
I get the error message "Protocol not supported by Krusader:" krarc: / path/ to/ foo-archive ", when I try to open foo-Archive, what to do?
The icons, kio_slaves and documentation must be installed in the correct places in the & kde; directory tree. The kio_krarc. * files must be in the same directory with the other KIO slaves. Try this: locate kio_tar. * and copy/ link the kio_krarc. * files to the same location. Do n't forget to run # ldconfig on this directory when you're done. For more information click here.
What to do if an external tool does n't seem to work?
Krusader uses several programs as external tools, and sometimes they appear not to work. Open a terminal and check if tool foo is installed. $foo Check if tool foo is properly configured in the Konfigurator Dependencies page. For Archiving tools: autodetect the archives again with the Auto Configure button in the Konfigurator archive page. Check the Konfigurator Protocol page If it does n't work, backup your ~/. kde/ share/ config/ krusaderrc configuration file and remove it from this location. Restart Krusader, Krusader will now start the first start configuration wizard, follow these guidelines.
How to executing jar files (and not enter the jar archive)?
Go to the Konfigurator Protocol page and remove application/ x-jar from the krarc node, & krusader; should no longer enter the archive. Global file associations are handled by & kde; and not by & krusader;. To associate the jar extension:
Open & kde; s & systemsettings;: systemsettings
KDE Components File Associations
Enter jar as filename pattern
Add java as application
Why do I have trouble with my & FTP; connection?
This problem often occurs when you are behind a firewall or proxy. Open KDE Control Center Network Preferences, "Enable Passive Mode (PASV)" has to be turned on or off, depending on it's current setting. Now try your & FTP; session again to see if it works. Also, make sure you have no other & FTP; sessions open (using web browsers, & etc;), they can cause complications. More information can be found in Active & FTP; vs. Passive & FTP;, a Definitive Explanation.
I get "FTP protocol not supported by & krusader;" error when trying to open a remote & FTP; directory, what to do?
The reason for this error is that'FTP; via & HTTP; proxy 'feature is not yet supported by & krusader;. This error may be caused by a misconfiguration of the proxy settings in & kcontrolcenter;. Modify the proxy settings to not use & HTTP; proxy and & FTP; will work.
How do n't add ". part" suffix when copying files via ftp?
When uploading files a. part suffix is added to the filename, once the upload is complete the filename is renamed automagically to remove the. part suffix. This works great but sometimes some ftp-servers do n't allow a rename operation. You can solve this by unchecking the checkbox Mark partially uploaded files in & kde; 's control center. The check box is located at Internet and Network Connection Preferences.
How can I close a remote connection (eg; a & FTP; connection)?
It's explained in the remote connections chapter.
I am experiencing problems with the media: / protocol, why?
The media: / protocol was removed from & kde; 4.
How can I disable the default sounds, & eg; when I do a delete action?
Those are the default & kde; System sounds, and not related to & krusader;. If you want to disable them globally open your & kde; & systemsettings; (systemsettings): KDE Control Center Sound & Multimedia System Notifications, Event Source: "KDE System Notifications" and uncheck sound items you do n't like.
Where the remote connection manager?
Use our Bookmark Manager. Use a remote & URL; and bookmark it.
Why does n't mimetype magic sometimes work inside archives?
When you enter an archive and press F3 to view a file that has no known extension, & eg; README, INSTALL & etc;. And if the viewer opens in hex-mode instead of the usual mode, than you need to configure: KDE Control Center KDE components File Associations Application octet-stream, binary viewer needs to be removed.
Where is Konfigurator, do i need to install the & kde; Desktop Environment to use it?
Konfigurator is & krusader; s configuration module, if you have installed & krusader; then you have also Konfigurator. For some reason some people think it's an other & kde; application, but it is not, so you do n't need to install the & kde; Desktop Environment to use Konfigurator. When running & krusader;, use Settings Configure & krusader;, and it will start Konfigurator. Please read the manual, & krusader; has many many configuration options, a lot of things can be customized to your needs with Konfigurator.
How can I set the look & feel of 2 different users to be the same?
Presuming that the current setup is the good configuration, you can copy the configuration to the other user. # cp ~/. kde/ share/ config/ krusaderrc / home/ foo_user/. kde/ share/ config And when the other user is Root use:
# cp ~/. kde/ share/ config/ krusaderrc / root/. kde/ share/ config
General & FAQ;
How can I report a wish, a suggestion, or a comment?
An open source project's greatest strength is derived from getting user feedback. That is why we love to hear what you have to say. Your "gripes" are our instructions. After about 6 months, programmers can no longer see their own mistakes. It's natural. We want the ideas, qritiques, and feedback because we all want to make & krusader; the best and most useful file manager available anywhere.
The most convenient way to contact us is to use the krusader; Forum, or the krusader-users mailing lists. For information on what remains to be done look at the ToDo Forum. Adding ToDo items into the ToDo Forum is for developers only, but feel free to post to the New Features Discussion/ Requests Forum for things that are n't on the ToDo Forum, but should be. If you have a nice feature request, the & krusader; Krew will add your request to the ToDo Forum. We review and discuss every submission. For more information how the forum works click here.
How can I send a patch?
It's not easy to write patch guidelines, but here are some.
Patches, new code or new features are always welcome!
Focus only on one problem at a time, so the developers can easily understand you, and commit your patch it works.
Preferably, you can start a discussion with the developers on the krusader-devel mailing lists or on the krusader; Forum. Unfortunately, we cannot apply a patch if the patch is in conflict with the "general design" of the & krusader; code (read for more instructions in this FAQ). Please send only one change request per mail, so that the discussion is easier to follow. The modifications should be committed step by step, checking each line.
Submit your patch files into our Patch Tracker, so that all patch proposals stay organised and do n't get lost, tar. gz archives or diffs are usually ok. Do not copy changes into a mail. Most mailers will change the white spaces, so that the diff will not apply or the code snipped does not diff. In the past, patch mails went lost or disorganized in many many mails, so please use the Patch Tracker, thanks!
Use portable solutions, & krusader; should run on: All POSIX (Linux; /BSD/ UNIX; -like OSes), & Solaris;. All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD / NetBSD / OpenBSD / MacOS;). kde; 3.3- & kde; 3.5 and even on GNOME with & kde; libs (for krusader-2. x & kde; 4). GCC 2.95 - GCC 4.1 Architecture changes are made by the team only.
A final note: always keep in mind a patch might be rejected. Either it has side effects, which we could not fix or it contradicts with the idea behind the patched module. In this sense, a software project differs from, let's say a wiki: a software project has to have someone to make all the final decisions. Otherwise the software will not work. Furthermore: keep in mind that the examination of patches might take time, as we all have private lives.
How can I report a bug?
Bugs?!?!? Well, ok.... We have an online Bug Tracking System.
Using the online bug-tracker helps us have a clear and orderly way to know how many bugs are open, bug priority and follow-ups. It saves us from browsing through the entire & krusader; forum, searching for yesterdays bug. Please use this system.
Before reporting a bug, please read the following:
Use the krusader; Forum's Search function, your bug might be already solved. Please DO NOT post new bugs to the Bug Discussion Forum (except if you are not sure that you have found a bug). We use it for bug discussions.
Check if the bug is already posted in the online bug list of the Bug Tracking System.
If you cannot find this bug mentioned, please submit it into the bug tracker by clicking the Submit New button in the bug-tracker window. Please submit the following issues: the & krusader; version used, the & Linux; distribution + version used, processor type, and as good a description of the problem as you can manage.
If possible, try to do the same operation with & konqueror; or another & kde; application. If you encounter the same problem then it is possibly a KIO Slaves or & kde; (kdelibs) bug, and not a & krusader; bug. & krusader; uses the & kde; libraries and the KIO Slave for many operations. In some cases you can encounter problems if your distribution is incorrectly configured, please test it first as explained above.
If you've got bugs to report please do not use & kde; 's bugzilla http: / /bugs. kde. org/, & kde; 's Bug Tracking System. Report & krusader; bugs directly to us.
How can i send good debug or crash reports?
Usually binary packages that are been used by your distribution do not contain debug information. Since we usually only develop and fix & krusader; -cvs, compile & krusader; -cvs in debugmode and install it, than check if the bug still exist. $cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull Install valgrind, a suite of tools for debugging and profiling & Linux; programs. Run Valgrind/ krusader; $valgrind --tool=memcheck {foo_path}/ krusader The valgrind tool will write to stdout, what really happens. If you could send these informations before the crash, it's almost sure, that we may fix or tell you what to do.
What to do if the KDEcrashhandler sends no useful backtrace information?
Usually binary packages that are been used by your distribution do not contain debug information. Since we usually only develop and fix & krusader; -cvs, compile & krusader; -cvs in debugmode and install it, than check if the bug still exist. $cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull If the KDEKrashhandler still does n't provide useful backtrace information, than sometimes a coredump will give better information. Run Krusader, with disabled crashhandler. $krusader --nocrashhandler On a crash you will get a. core file, usually in your home directory. Run gdb, the GNU Project Debugger $gdb -c corefile krusader Now type bt to get the backtrace and type q to quit gdb. Often the best debug results will be given when using the valgrind tool.
Does & krusader; have a mailing list?
Yes, currently we have 5 mailing lists. No spam, no bother, just & krusader;. Feel free to subscribe and unsubscribe.
Tip. our mailing lists can be browsed online or read with a newsreader, so that you do n't even need to subscribe to follow the action on the mailing lists.
krusader; -news is a very low volume list, used for newsletters and announcements of new versions or critical bugfixes. The news can also be read online at latest news and in the News and Announcements Forum which are basically the same but displayed in another format.
krusader; -devel is the developer mailing list (read-only). If you want to follow the development of & krusader; on the cutting edge, this is the list to follow.
krusader; -users is the & krusader; users mailing list. Here you can ask for help and talk with the & krusader; users and developers.
krusader; -i18n is the translations mailing list.
krusader; -doc is the documentation mailing list.
Does & krusader; provide newsfeeds?
Yes, we do. Several newsfeeds in various formats are available. rss-filerelease feed, rss-forumfeed, krusader-news feed, krusader-devel feed and even additional feeds by gmane. org. krusader-users feed, krusader-i18n feed, krusader-doc feed.
Does & krusader; have an IRC channel?
Yes, we do. Feel free to talk to the & krusader; Krew and fellow-users via freenode. org servers. The server is irc. freenode. org, the channel is #krusader. Everyone is welcome.
How does the & krusader; forum work?
In the spirit of freedom of speech, everything that is & krusader; related can be discussed in our forum. It does not matter if you are a newcomer or an advanced user, everyone is welcome. An open source project's greatest strength is derived from getting user feedback. That is why we love to hear what you have to say. With your feedback we can make & krusader; better and better; otherwise, we are not aware of issues and ideas you may have. But please remember the following, so that we can maintain some order in the chaos.
If the Documentation, FAQ, krusader; Forum and krusader; -devel (please use the search function) cannot help you, do not hesitate to post on our forum. The & krusader; Krew or the & krusader; community is always available to help you.
Please use the Search function of the krusader; Forum, your issue may have been previously discussed (this allows us to minimize the double/ triple/... postings). If your issue has already been discussed in the past there is a great chance that you will have an instant solution to your problem. If the issue is currently being discussed, you can join in the discussion. Some questions are asked over and over again, that's why we have created this FAQ. This allows us to spend more time developing & krusader;.
The krusader; Forum is split into seven sections:
News and Announcements Forum: all the latest news.
NewsLetter Forum: all newsletters.
Bug Discussion Forum: discussions about bugs, please DO NOT use the forum for bug reports (except if you are unsure if you have found a bug).
New Features Discussion/ Requests Forum: discussions about new features for future & krusader; versions.
ToDo Forum here you will find the list of the planned features. Registered users will be able to VOTE and COMMENT on the TODO items. Here you get the chance to push your favourite features (+3) and still prefer certain features over others (+1), if you do n't care about a feature just simply do n't vote on that feature. Unregistered users may only browse the ToDo Forum. The ToDo ranking system contains the results based on the votes. Adding ToDo items or removing ToDo items which have been implemented will be done by the & krusader; Krew.
UserActions Forum: discussions about UserActions. Posting your own User Actions is greatly appreciated. We plan to include the best ones in the next & krusader; releases.
General Discussion Forum: everything that is & krusader; related and does n't belong in the other forums.
We provide a RSS feed for our forums. You do n't have to check for new posts all the time, instead the news will come to you!
How can I translate & krusader; into my native language?
If you are interested in translating the & krusader; GUI or documentation, please contact the KDE translation team of your lanuage.
How can I support & krusader;?
You can support & krusader; in many different ways. Please send us feedback, bug reports, patches, donations, translations,...
Is there a & MacOS; X port?
Yes, there is a MacOS; -X port with the help of macports. org, the port is maintained by Jonas Bauml; hr, all feedback is welcome. A recommended native file manager for & MacOS; is Disk Order (shareware).
Is there a & Windows; port?
Yes, there is a Windows; port since 18 June 2008. Before Krusader can be used several & Qt; 4-libraries and & kde; 4-libraries need to be installed. A recommended native file manager for & Windows; is Total Commander (shareware).
Why is & konqueror; in "midnight commander style" not an OFM?
The two panels and a commandline are available, all the other stuff like OFM features and the OFM interaction with the user is missing from this profile.
Why should I use an OFM?
An Orthodox File Manager (OFM) is much faster than a one panel filemanager and faster than the command line. If you would like to know how & krusader; feels, there is only one way to discover: install it on your computer and use it for a while. If you prefer to waste time and lose productivity, continue to use one panel filemanagers which are based on & Windows; Explorer. Matej Urbanccaron; iccaron; has written a blog on why OFM is better than a one panel filemanager.
