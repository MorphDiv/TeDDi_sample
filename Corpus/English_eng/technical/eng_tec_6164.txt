Introduction
& ktimetracker; tracks time spent on various tasks. It is useful for tracking billable hours and can report the hours logged by task and day.
This time history can be exported to a comma-delimited text file for import into other billing and/ or project management tools.
& ktimetracker; detects when your keyboard and mouse are idle and can associate different tasks with different desktops, two tools that can help keep the timer running on the correct task.
& ktimetracker; was originally written by & Sirtaj. Singh. Kang;. Its home page is http: / /userbase. kde. org/ ktimetracker.
Using & ktimetracker;
Starting & ktimetracker;
Type ktimetracker at a command prompt or select Personal Time Tracker from the Applications Utilities group in the KDE start menu. The standard & Qt; and & kde; command options are available, and can be listed by entering ktimetracker --help at the command line.
& ktimetracker; provides an additional command option that allows you to enter the name of the iCalendar file that is used to store your labor history. You enter a remote iCalendar file by using http or ftp as part of the file name; for example, http: / /www. mysite. com/ mydata/ mylabor. ics.
Tasks
Problem: You are a free software consultant with many clients. Some clients have multiple projects. During the course of a day, you switch back and forth between different projects. You need to track your time to generate monthly invoices.
Solution: Create one top-level task for each client and a subtask for each client project. For projects that require more detailed tracking, create a list of project subtasks. Track time by double-clicking on task you are currently working on.
& ktimetracker; provides great flexibility in tracking your time, allowing unlimited tasks and task depth. Time may be logged to any task, and more than one task can be active at any given time.
& ktimetracker; allows you to edit your task's history and to put a comment for every event that you have stopped.
To create a top-level task, select Ctrl; T Task... To create a subtask, pick the parent task and select Ctrl; Alt; N Task...
When & ktimetracker; exits, the task list is saved to a file on your disk. When it next opens, it reloads the task list from the same file.
& ktimetracker; can import and export tasks to minimize your work. See Other Systems.
Timers
Problem: To remain solvent, you must bill an average of five hours a day. To stay on track, you watch your daily and weekly totals.
Solution: Reset the session timer at the beginning of each work day and reset all timers at the beginning of each week.
& ktimetracker; makes tracking time simple. To start logging time against a task, double-click on the task. To stop logging time, double-click the task again. Active tasks display a small clock in the Session Time column.
Another visual clue of logging activity is the & ktimetracker; system tray icon. When a task is active, the second hand in the icon moves. If you rest the mouse pointer over this icon, the name of the active task will display in a tooltip. If more than one task is active, the task names in the tooltip are separated by commas.
& ktimetracker; maintains two timers for each task: one for the session time and one for the total time. In the default configuration, & ktimetracker; displays two columns for each timer, resulting in a total of four columns for each task:
Session Time
The time spent on the task since the session began.
Total Session Time
The time spent on the task and all its subtasks since the session began.
Time
The time spent on the task since all times were reset.
Total Time
The time spent on the task and all its subtasks since all times were reset.
To start a new session, select File Start New Session
To reset all times, select File Reset All Times
Desktop Tracking
Problem: You have two main projects that you switch between each day. To help organize your work, you keep your project 1 files on Desktop 1 and your project 2 files on Desktop 2.
Solution: Associate project 1 task with Desktop 1 and the project 2 task with Desktop 2. When you switch from Desktop 2 to Desktop 1 active, & ktimetracker; automatically stops the project 2 task and starts the project 1 task.
To associate a task with a one or more desktops, select Ctrl; E Task Edit.... Turn on Auto Tracking and select the desktop or desktops to associate with this task. When any of the selected desktops becomes active, after a short delay & ktimetracker; will be automatically start logging time against that task.
Idle Detection
Problem: You leave work early on Friday to run an errand and forget to stop the timer. When you return on Monday, the timer is still running.
Solution: Turn on idle detection.
& ktimetracker; can be configured to detect when the mouse and keyboard become idle. If the mouse and keyboard are idle for longer than the specified number of minutes, & ktimetracker; displays the following dialog:
& ktimetracker; Idle Detection
& ktimetracker; Idle Detection Dialog
Continue timing
Apply the idle time to all active timers and keep them running.
You were working on the task(s) while your computer was idle and still are.
Revert timing
Subtract the amount of idle time from all active timers and stop them.
You were not working on the task(s) while you computer was idle and you are still are not.
Other Systems
& korganizer;
& ktimetracker;, like & korganizer; and Apple's iCal, uses the industry standard iCalendar format for its data. & ktimetracker; can read and write the to do lists created by these two applications.
If both & ktimetracker; and & korganizer; have the same file open, if you edit the file with & korganizer;, you risk losing data. To be safe, only edit the file with one application or the other.
Planner
As a typical usecase, you might want to plan a project with the project management tool Imendio Planner (from planner. imendio. org) and import its tasks to & ktimetracker; with File Import Import Tasks From Planner..., to have them in the industry standard iCalendar format. Having done so, you are able to schedule the tasks in & korganizer;, and account your time to them in & ktimetracker;. That's one way to help ensure your project stays on time and under budget.
DBus;
& DBus; is the mechanism & kde; programs use to communicate with each other. A & kde; program provides a list of functions that other programs (a Bash script, for example) can use.
Bash script that echo's & ktimetracker; 's version
qdbus org. kde. ktimetracker / KTimeTracker version 2 > / dev/ null || echo "ktimetracker not running"
& ktimetracker; 's current & DBus; interface is currently used mainly for automated testing, so it is very limited. For the full interface definition, see DBus; Interface Appendix.
To see the full & DBus; interface of the & ktimetracker; version installed on your system, run the following Bash script:
List & ktimetracker; 's & DBus; interface to console
qdbus org. kde. ktimetracker / KTimeTracker 2 > / dev/ null || echo "ktimetracker not running"
Export Totals to CSV
& ktimetracker; can export both totals and history to a comma-delimited file format. To export totals, select File Export Export Times... and & ktimetracker; displays the following export dialog:
ktimetracker; CSV Export Dialog
ktimetracker; CSV Export Dialog
Enter the file you would like to export the data to, and modify the other dialog defaults if necessary. Click Export and & ktimetracker; exports the totals for all tasks to the file you selected.
Use the Export to Clipboard button to export the times to the clipboard
Here is an example of the output format:
"kde",,, ,,0.00,0.00,6.88,9.83, "ktimetracker",,, ,6.88,8.70,6.88,9.83, ,"3.2 feature plan ", ,,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00, ,"bugs", ,,0.00,1.13,0.00,1.13, ,"checkin changes - translation strings ", ,,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00, ,"time card report", ,,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00, "kopete",,, ,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00, "promo",,, ,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00, "web stuff",,, ,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00
Top-level tasks are output in the first column, sub-tasks in the second, and so on. The time data is output after the maximum task depth (five in this example). The first time column is Session Time, the second is Time, the third is Total Session Time and the fourth is the Total Time.
Export History to CSV
To export task history, select File Export Export History... and & ktimetracker; displays the same export dialog as shown above.
Enter the file you would like to export the data to, and select a date range that you want the task history. Modify the other dialog defaults if necessary. Click Export and & ktimetracker; exports the task history for all tasks to the file you selected.
Use the Export to Clipboard button to export the history to the clipboard
Task History From Tuesday 06 July 2004 to Tuesday 13 July 2004 Printed on: 2004-07-13 18:10 2004-07-06,2004-07-07,2004-07-08,2004-07-09,2004-07-10,2004-07-11,2004-07-12,2004-07-13,,,,,,,, ,0.00, "kde", ,1.77,3.23,1.73, ,1.37,0.82,8.95, ,"ktimetracker ",,,,,,, ,0.00,,," 3.2 feature plan ",1.13,,,,, ,,1.13,,," bugs ",,,,,,, ,0.00,,," checkin changes - translation strings ",,,,,,, ,0.00,,," time card report ",,,,,,, ,0.00, ,"kopete",,,,,,, ,0.00, ,"promo ",,,,,,, ,0.00, ,"web stuff"
The three lines identify when the report was generated and for which date range. The fourth row is a comma-delimited list of the dates in the date range, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). All subsequent rows list the time logged against each task. The last numeric column is the row total across all days. The task name prints after the total column, and is indented to indicate the task/ sub-task relationship. Top level task names appear in the first column after the total.
The & ktimetracker; interface
The main & ktimetracker; window has the following components: menubar, toolbar, task/ time window and status bar.
ktimetracker; Screen
ktimetracker; Screen
The Task/ Time window
The various tasks are displayed in this window, along with the time accumulated for each in the current session and in total. Tasks being timed have a small clock icon next to the session time.
Subtasks can be created for each task. Clicking the plus sign and minus sign in front of the main task toggles the view of its associated subtasks. The total time accrued for a task includes the times for its subtasks, as well as its own accumulated time.
The Toolbar
The toolbar contains icons for the following commands:
(All behave identically to the menu command.)
Start
Stop
New
New Subtask
Delete
Edit
The Statusbar
Reports the name of the file where the data was saved.

active task
A task which has a timer running.
DBus;
The interprocess communication protocol used in & kde;. Short for Desktop Bus.
desktop
& GNU; /Linux;, FreeBSD and other systems that run X-Windows have multiple desktops. You typically have four different desktops installed by default. Each desktop can display its own set of programs and files. When & kde; first starts up, the desktop you see is Desktop 1. If you press Ctrl; F2, you will see Desktop 2. Pressing Ctrl; F1 will bring back Desktop 1.
history
If & ktimetracker; is configured to log history, it will record ever start/ stop timer event. This history is never cleared when times are reset cleared and remains on file until the task is deleted.
session
A user-defined starting point for the session timers. A new session begins when you select File Start New Session. Session data is not saved when you create a new session.
system tray
The system tray is in the bar that (by default) appears at the bottom of the screen. In this system tray the & ktimetracker; icon is on the far right.
top level task
A task with no parent tasks.

version
version
Return & ktimetracker; 's version.
QString version()
Description
version() is a & DBus; call that returns & ktimetracker; 's version number; for example 4.3.1. The version number is returned as a string in the typical & GNU; format of major. minor. bugfix.
quit
quit
Return & ktimetracker; 's quit.
QString quit()
quit() is a & DBus; call that provides a way that an external program can gracefully shutdown & ktimetracker;.
addtodo
addTask
Add new task.
QString addTask(QString taskname)
Parameters
taskname
The name of new task.
addTask(QString taskname) is a & DBus; call that adds a new top-level to-do to the current storage. The UID of the new task is returned.
Revert & Stop
Revert & Continue
Subtract the amount of idle time from all active timers but keep them running.
You were not working on the task(s) while your computer was idle but you are now.
& ktimetracker; provides three ways to report on time you have logged. You can send the session and time totals to the printer, copy the time totals to the clipboard, or copy the time history to the clipboard.
Print Totals
To generate the totals report for the printer, select Ctrl; P File Print. This generates a three-column report for the complete list of tasks. The first column is the task name, the second column is the Total Session Time and the third column is the Total Time.
Clip Totals
To generate the totals report to the clipboard, select Ctrl; C File to Clipboard.
This report is generated for the currently selected task and all its subtasks. If the current task is a top-level task, & ktimetracker; asks you if you want to generate the report for the current task and its subtasks or for the entire task list.
& ktimetracker; Copy This Task
& ktimetracker; Copy This Task Dialog
Once the report is generated, open & kedit; or some other text editor and paste the report data.
Task Totals 2004-07-10 02:26 Time Task ---------------------------------------------- 9:14 kde 9:14 ktimetracker 1:08 bugs 0:00 checkin changes 0:00 promo 0:00 web stuff ---------------------------------------------- 9:14 Total
The first column is the Total Time and is indented (like the task names) to indicate task/ sub-task relationships. The reported times include the sub-task times.
Clip History
To generate the totals report to the clipboard, select Ctrl; Alt; C File to Clipboard.
You must turn on the Log History option in Settings Configure KTimeTracker.... Otherwise, & ktimetracker; only keeps track of totals and not the detailed task history.
This report is generated for the currently selected task and all it's subtasks. You also have the choice to generate it for all tasks.
When you select the history report, & ktimetracker; first prompts you to enter the date range for the report:
ktimetracker; Enter Date Range
ktimetracker; Enter Date Range
After entering a date range, open & kedit; or some other text editor and paste the report data.
Task History From Thursday 01 July 2004 to Monday 12 July 2004 Printed on: 2004-07-12 17:18 Week of Monday 05 July 2004 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0:00 kde 0:00 dc! :22 1:46 3:14 1:44 8:06 ktimetracker 0:00 3.2 feature plan 1:08 1:08 bugs 0:00 checkin changes 0:00 promo 0:00 web stuff ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2:30 1:46 3:14 1:44 9:14 Total
The task history is totaled for each day and task, grouped by week. The first seven columns are Monday through Sunday. The eighth column is the total for the week and the ninth column is the task name. The task names are indented to indicate the task/ sub-task relationships.
Enter the file you would like to export the data to, and modify the other dialog defaults if necessary. Note that the date range control is disabled since you are exporting time totals, not the history data. Click Export and & ktimetracker; exports the totals for all tasks to the file you selected.
Reports the total elapsed time for the session.
hastodo
