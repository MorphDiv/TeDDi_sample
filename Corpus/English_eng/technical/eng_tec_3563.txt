(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a complete entry information in a multi-dimensional array on success and FALSE on error.
ldap_get_attributes() function is used to simplify reading the attributes and values from an entry in the search result.
The return value is a multi-dimensional array of attributes and values.
Having located a specific entry in the directory, you can find out what information is held for that entry by using this call.
You would use this call for an application which "browses" directory entries and / or where you do not know the structure of the directory entries.
In many applications you will be searching for a specific attribute such as an email address or a surname, and won 't care what other data is held.
return_value[ "count"] = number of attributes in the entry return_value[0] = first attribute return_value[n] = nth attribute return_value["attribute"]["count"] = number of values for attribute return_value["attribute"][0] = first value of the attribute return_value["attribute"][i] = (i+1 )th value of the attribute
Example 1.
Show the list of attributes held for a particular directory entry
/ / $ds is the link identifier for the directory / / $sr is a valid search result from a prior call to / / one of the ldap directory search calls $entry = ldap_first_entry( $ds, $sr); $attrs = ldap_get_attributes($ds, $entry); echo $attrs["count"]. "attributes held for this entry: p"; for ($i=0; $i $attrs["count"]; $i++) echo $attrs[$i]. "br";
