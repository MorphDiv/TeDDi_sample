addressing of URLs in the file system and on the Internet.
Relative addressing is only possible if the source document and the referenced document are both on the same drive.
A relative address always starts from the directory in which the current document is located.
In contrast, absolute addressing always starts from a root directory.
The following table demonstrates the difference in syntax between relative and absolute referencing:
Examples

relative
../images/img.jpg
../images/img.jpg
absolute
file:///c|/work/images/img.jpg

Default file format and ODF settings

format (ODF) version 1.2.
The prior versions of OpenOffice.org 2 and StarOffice 8 support the file formats ODF 1.0/1.1.
Those prior file formats cannot store all new features of the new software.
OpenOffice.org 3 and StarOffice 9 can open documents in ODF formats 1.0/1.1 and 1.2.
When you save a document in OpenOffice.org 3 or StarOffice 9, you can select whether to save the document in the new format ODF 1.2 or in the prior format ODF 1.0/1.1.
Insert - Comment
in the latest software version.
The comments get lost when loading files into prior software versions that were saved by the latest software version.
Some companies or organisations may require ODF documents in the ODF 1.0/1.1 format.
You can select that format to save in the list box.
This older format cannot store all new features, so the new format ODF 1.2 is recommended where possible.
Size optimisation for ODF format
%PRODUCTNAME
writes the XML data without indents and extra line breaks.
This allows documents to be saved and opened more quickly, and the file size is smaller.

You can choose which file format will be applied as the default when saving documents of various document types.
If you always exchange your documents with other persons who use Microsoft Office, for example, you may specify here that %PRODUCTNAME only uses the Microsoft Office file formats as a default.
