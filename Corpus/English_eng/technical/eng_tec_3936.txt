mysql_affected_rows() returns the number of rows affected by the last INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE query associated with link_identifier.
If the link identifier isn' t specified, the last link opened by mysql_connect() is assumed.
Note:
If you are using transactions, you need to call mysql_affected_rows() after your INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE query, not after the commit.
If the last query was a DELETE query with no WHERE clause, all of the records will have been deleted from the table but this function will return zero.
Note:
When using UPDATE, MySQL will not update columns where the new value is the same as the old value.
This creates the possiblity that mysql_affected_rows() may not actually equal the number of rows matched, only the number of rows that were literally affected by the query.
mysql_affected_rows() does not work with SELECT statements; only on statements which modify records.
To retrieve the number of rows returned by a SELECT, use mysql_num_rows().
If the last query failed, this function will return -1.
Example 1.
Delete-Query
?php / * connect to database * / mysql_pconnect( "localhost", "mysql_user", "mysql_password") or die("Could not connect: ". mysql_error()); / * this should return the correct numbers of deleted records * / mysql_query("DELETE FROM mytable WHERE id 10"); printf ("Records deleted: %d\n", mysql_affected_rows()); / * without a where clause in a delete statement, it should return 0 * / mysql_query("DELETE FROM mytable"); printf ("Records deleted: %d\n", mysql_affected_rows());?
The above example would produce the following output:
Records deleted:
10 Records deleted:
0
Example 2.
Update-Query
?php / * connect to database * / mysql_pconnect( "localhost", "mysql_user", "mysql_password") or die("Could not connect: ". mysql_error()); / * Update records * / mysql_query("UPDATE mytable SET used=1 WHERE id 10"); printf ("Updated records: %d\n", mysql_affected_rows()); mysql_query("COMMIT");?
The above example would produce the following output:
Updated Records:
10
