(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Identical to readfile(), except that file() returns the file in an array.
Each element of the array corresponds to a line in the file, with the newline still attached.
Upon failure, file() returns FALSE.
Note:
Each line in the resulting array will include the line ending, so you still need to use trim() if you do not want the line ending present.
Note:
If you are having problems with PHP not recognizing the line endings when reading files either on or created by a Macintosh computer, you might want to enable the auto_detect_line_endings run-time configuration option.
You can use the optional use_include_path parameter and set it to "1", if you want to search for the file in the include_path, too.
?php / / Get a file into an array.
In this example we' ll go through HTTP to get / / the HTML source of a URL. $lines = file ('http: / /www.example.com / '); / / Loop through our array, show html source as html source; and line numbers too. foreach ($lines as $line_num = $line) {echo "Line # b {$line_num} / b: ". htmlspecialchars($line)." br \n";} / / Another example, let's get a web page into a string.
See also file_get_contents(). $html = implode ('', file ('http: / /www.example.com / '));?
Note:
As of PHP 4.3.0 you can use file_get_contents() to return the contents of a file as a string.
In PHP 4.3.0 file() became binary safe.
Tip:
You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled.
See fopen() for more details on how to specify the filename and Appendix I for a list of supported URL protocols.
See also readfile(), fopen(), fsockopen(), popen(), file_get_contents(), and include().
