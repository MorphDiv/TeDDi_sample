Copy Table
/text/shared/explorer/database/05030100.xhp
Copy Table
Copy Table
dialogue box will appear.
Table name
Specifies a name for the copy.
Some databases only accept names containing eight or fewer characters.
Options
Definition and data
Creates a 1:1 copy of the database table.
The table definition and the complete data are copied.
The table definition includes the table structure and format from different data fields, including special field properties.
The field contents supply the data.
Definition
Copies only the table definition and not the corresponding data.
As table view
If the database supports Views, you can select this option only when a query is copied in a table container.
This option enables you to see and edit a query as a normal table view.
The table will be filtered in the view with a &quot; Select &quot; SQL statement.
Append data
Appends the data of the table to be copied to an existing table.
The table definition must be exactly the same so that data can be copied.
Data cannot be copied if a data field in the target table has a different format from the data field in the source table.
Copy Table
dialogue box on the
Apply Columns
page.
Column Info
dialogue box whose data cannot be copied.
If you confirm this dialogue box with OK, only the data that does not appear in the list will be attached.
If the fields of the target table have a smaller field length than in the source table when data is being attached, the source data fields will automatically be truncated to match the field lengths in the target table.
primary keys; defining
Create primary key
Automatically generates a primary key data field and fills it with values.
You should use this field if you copy a dBASE table to the Adabas format, since in the Adabas format a primary key must always be available in order to edit the table.
Name
Specifies a name for the primary key generated.
This name is optional.
