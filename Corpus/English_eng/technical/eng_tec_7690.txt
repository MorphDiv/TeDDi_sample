4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Ambirix is for use in non-immune persons from 1 year up to and including 15 years for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B infection.
Protection against hepatitis B infections may not be obtained until after the second dose (see section 5.1).
Therefore:
- Ambirix should be used only when there is a relatively low risk of hepatitis B infection during
the vaccination course.
- It is recommended that Ambirix should be administered in settings where completion of the
two-dose vaccination course can be assured.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Posology
- Dosage
A dose of 1.0 ml is recommended for subjects from 1 year up to and including 15 years of age.
- Primary vaccination schedule
The standard primary course of vaccination with Ambirix consists of two doses, the first administered at the elected date and the second between six and twelve months after the first dose.
2 The recommended schedule should be adhered to.
Once initiated, the primary course of vaccination should be completed with the same vaccine.
- Booster dose
In situations where a booster dose of hepatitis A and/ or hepatitis B is desired, a monovalent or combined vaccine can be given.
The safety and immunogenicity of Ambirix administered as a booster dose following a two dose primary course have not been evaluated.
The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody titres observed following a primary vaccination course with Ambirix are in the range of what is seen following vaccination with the monovalent hepatitis A and B vaccines.
General guidelines for booster vaccination can therefore be drawn from experience with the monovalent vaccines, as follows.
Hepatitis B
The need for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine in healthy individuals who have received a full primary vaccination course has not been established.
However some official vaccination programmes currently include a recommendation for a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine and these should be respected.
For some categories of subjects at risk of exposure to HBV (e. g. haemodialysis or immunocompromised patients) a precautionary attitude should be considered to ensure that a protective antibody level ≥ 10 mIU/ ml is maintained.
Hepatitis A
It is not yet fully established whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination will require booster doses as protection in the absence of detectable antibodies may be ensured by immunological memory.
Guidelines for boosting are based on the assumption that antibodies are required for protection.
Anti-HAV antibodies have been predicted to persist for at least 10 years.
Method of administration
Ambirix is for intramuscular injection, usually into the deltoid muscle.
However the anterolateral thigh may be used in very young subjects if preferred.
Exceptionally, the vaccine may be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders.
However, this route of administration may result in suboptimal immune response to the vaccine.
(see section 4.4)
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients or neomycin.
Hypersensitivity after previous administration of hepatitis A and/ or hepatitis B vaccines.
As with other vaccines, the administration of Ambirix should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.
3 It is possible that subjects may be in the incubation period of a hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccination.
It is not known whether Ambirix will prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B in such cases.
The vaccine will not prevent infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis C and hepatitis E and other pathogens known to infect the liver.
Ambirix is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis (e. g. needle stick injury).
If rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard three dose regimen of the combined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen is recommended.
This is because, a higher proportion of subjects are protected in the interval between the second and third dose of the three dose combined vaccine, than after a single dose of Ambirix.
This difference is no longer present after the second dose of Ambirix (see section 5.1 for seroprotection rates).
It is recommended that the two-dose regimen of Ambirix be completed prior to start of sexual activity.
The vaccine has not been tested in patients with an impaired immune system.
In haemodialysis patients and persons with an impaired immune system, adequate anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody titers may not be obtained after the primary immunisation course.
Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration into the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal response to the vaccine, these routes should be avoided.
However, exceptionally Ambirix can be administered subcutaneously to subjects with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects.
AMBIRIX SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE ADMINISTERED INTRAVASCULARLY.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No data on concomitant administration of Ambirix with specific hepatitis A immunoglobulin or hepatitis B immunoglobulin have been generated.
However, when the monovalent hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines were administered concomitantly with specific immunoglobulins there was no effect on seroconversion rates.
Concomitant immunoglobulin administration may result in lower antibody titres.
When Ambirix was administered concomitantly with, but as a separate injection to a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV/ Hib) or with a combined Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine in the second year of life, immune responses to all antigens were satisfactory (see section 5.1)
Concomitant administration of Ambirix and other vaccines than those listed above has not been studied.
It is advised that Ambirix should not be administered at the same time as other vaccines unless absolutely necessary.
Concomitant vaccines should always be administered at separate injection sites and preferably into different limbs.
It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
4 The effect of Ambirix on foetal development has not been assessed.
Ambirix should not be used during pregnancy unless it is clearly necessary.
Lactation
The effect on breastfed infants of Ambirix administered to the mothers has not been evaluated in clinical studies.
Ambirix should not be used during lactation unless it is clearly necessary.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Drowsiness and dizziness can sometimes occur and may affect the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The current formulation of Ambirix does not contain thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) or any preservative.
In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, gastro-enteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the incidence observed with the former thiomersal and preservative containing vaccine formulation.
The following adverse reactions have been reported following the widespread use of the former formulation
Clinical trials involved the administration of 2029 doses of Ambirix to 1027 subjects from 1 year up to and including 15 years of age.
Local and general adverse reactions reported following primary vaccination with Ambirix were categorised by frequency.
Frequencies are reported below as:
Very common:
Common:
Uncommon:
Rare:
Very rare:
≥ 1/ 10 ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100 ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000 < 1/ 10,000
Nervous system disorders: very common: headache common: drowsiness
Gastrointestinal disorders: common: gastrointestinal symptoms
Metabolism and nutrition disorders very common: loss of appetite
General disorders and administration site conditions very common: pain, redness, fatigue common: swelling, fever
Psychiatric disorders: very common: irritability/ fussiness
In a study, in 300 subjects aged from 12 years up to and including 15 years, the reactogenicity profile of Ambirix was compared to that of the three-dose combined vaccine.
The three-dose vaccine contained 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in 0.5 ml.
The incidence of local and general solicited symptoms after a two dose regimen of Ambirix was overall similar to that seen with the three dose
5 combined vaccine, the only exceptions being a higher incidence of pain and fatigue on a per dose basis after Ambirix, but not on a per subject basis.
Pain was reported following 50.7% of doses in the Ambirix group, as compared to 39.1% of doses with the three dose combined vaccine.
However, over the complete vaccination course, 66.4% of subjects who received Ambirix reported pain, as compared to 63.8% of subjects who received the three dose combined vaccine.
Fatigue was reported following 29.2% doses of Ambirix, as compared to 19.3% doses of the three dose combined vaccine.
However, the incidence of fatigue was similar based on a per subject analysis (i. e. over the total vaccination course, 39.6% versus 36.2% of subjects for Ambirix and the three dose vaccine respectively).
The incidence of pain and fatigue graded as severe was low and similar to that observed with the three dose combined vaccine.
In a comparative trial in subjects aged 1-11 years, the incidences of local and general solicited symptoms in the Ambirix group were similar to those seen with the three-dose combined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.
The exception was a higher incidence of pain after Ambirix in 6-11 year olds on a per dose basis, but not on a per subject basis.
The percentages of vaccinees reporting any solicited symptom graded as severe during a two-dose regimen of Ambirix or a three dose regimen with the combined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, were not statistically different.
During post-marketing surveillance with the three dose combined vaccine containing either 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml (recommended for subjects 1 year up to and including 15 years of age) or 720 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 20 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 1 ml (recommended from the age of 16 years onwards), the following adverse reactions have been reported.
Investigations abnormal liver function tests
Blood and lymphatic system disorders thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, lymphadenopathy
Nervous system disorders syncope, dizziness, paresthesia, convulsions
Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders rash, pruritis, urticaria
Metabolism and nutrition disorders decreased appetite
Vascular disorders Hypotension
General disorders and administration site conditions flu-like symptoms, fatigue
6 Immune system disorders allergic reactions including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions and serum sickness like disease
Following widespread use of the monovalent hepatitis A and/ or hepatitis B vaccines, the following adverse reactions have additionally been reported.
Nervous system disorders multiple sclerosis, myelitis, facial palsy, polyneuritis such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (with ascending paralysis), encephalitis, encephalopathy
Eye disorders optic neuritis

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmaco-therapeutic group:
Hepatitis vaccines, ATC code J07BC20.
Ambirix confers immunity against HAV and HBV infection by inducing specific anti-HAV and anti- HBs antibodies.
In clinical studies involving subjects from 1 year up to and including 15 years old, seropositivity rates for anti-HAV antibodies were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% after the second dose given at month 6 (i. e month 7).
Seropositivity rates for anti-HBs antibodies were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% after the second dose given at month 6 (i. e. month 7).
The anti-HBs seroprotection rates (titers ≥ 10 mlU/ ml) at these time points were 37.4% and 98.2% respectively.
In a comparative clinical trial conducted among subjects aged from 12 years up to and including 15 years of age, 142 received two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard three-dose combined vaccine.
The latter contained 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.
For the 289 subjects evaluable for immunogenicity, seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher at months 2 and 6 with the three-dose vaccine than with Ambirix.

In a clinical study, 102 subjects aged from 12 years up to and including 15 years received the second dose of Ambirix at month 12, seropositivity rates for anti-HAV were 99.0% and seropositivity rates for anti-HBs were 99.0% at month 13 with seroprotection rates of 97.0%.
In subjects aged 12-15 years at the time of primary vaccination, anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies have been shown to persist for at least 24 months following the initiation of a 0, 6 month schedule of Ambirix.
Seropositivity rates were 100% and 94.2% respectively for anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies at month 24.
The seroprotection rate for anti-HBs at this time point was 93.3%.
In this study, the immune response to both antigen components was comparable to that seen after a 3-dose regimen of the combined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.
In a clinical study involving subjects from 12 years up to and including 15 years of age, the persistence of anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies at month 24 was shown to be similar following a 0, 6 month or a 0, 12 month schedule.
When the first dose of Ambirix was administered concomitantly with a booster dose of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV/ Hib) or with the first dose of a combined Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine in the second year of life, immune responses to all antigens were satisfactory.
These data were generated with the former Ambirix formulation containing thiomersal and a preservative.
A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed that the current formulation elicited similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as compared to the former formulation.

1.
WHAT AMBIRIX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Ambirix is a vaccine used in infants, children and adolescents from 1 year up to and including 15 years to prevent two infectious diseases: hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these infectious diseases.
• Hepatitis A:
Hepatitis A is an infectious disease that affects the liver, caused by the hepatitis A virus.
The hepatitis A virus is usually caught from food or drink that contains the virus, but is sometimes spread by other means, such as swimming in water contaminated by sewage.
Symptoms of hepatitis A begin 3 to 6 weeks after coming into contact with the virus.
These consist of nausea (feeling sick), fever and aches and pains.
After a few days the whites of eyes and skin may become yellowish (jaundice).
The severity and type of symptoms can vary.
Young children may not develop jaundice.
Most people recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to keep people ill for about a month.
• Hepatitis B:
Infection with the hepatitis B virus may cause the liver to become swollen (inflamed).
The virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, or saliva (spit) of infected people.
Symptoms may not be seen for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection.
Sometimes people who have been infected do not look or feel ill.
Others have mild flu-like symptoms, but some people can become very ill.
They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale faces, yellowish skin and/ or eyes (jaundice), and other symptoms possibly requiring hospitalisation.
Most adults fully recover from the disease.
But some people, particularly children, who may not have had symptoms can remain infected.
They are called hepatitis B virus carriers.
Hepatitis B carriers can infect others throughout their lives.
Hepatitis B carriers are at risk of serious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver cancer.
The vaccine does not contain live virus and cannot cause hepatitis A or B infections.
As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely prevent infections with hepatitis A or B viruses, even after you have/ your child has received both doses.
20 Also, if you have/ your child has already been infected with hepatitis A or B virus (although not yet feeling unwell) before having both doses of Ambirix, the vaccine may not be able to prevent you/ your child becoming ill.
Ambirix can only help to protect you/ your child against infections with hepatitis A or B viruses.
It cannot protect you/ your child against other infections that can affect the liver that can cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or B infections.
2.
BEFORE YOU RECEIVE/ YOUR CHILD RECEIVES AMBIRIX
Ambirix should not be given:
• if you have/ your child has previously had any allergic reaction to Ambirix, or any ingredient contained in this vaccine including neomycin (antibiotic).
The active substances and other ingredients in Ambirix are listed at the end of the leaflet.
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. • if you have/ your child has previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B diseases. • if you have/ your child has a severe infection with a high temperature.
In these cases, the vaccination will be postponed until you/ your child has recovered.
A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first.
Take special care with Ambirix:
• if you think that you need to be protected rapidly against hepatitis B infection, that is, within six months and before the second dose will be due.
If you are/ your child is likely to be at risk of hepatitis B infection between the timing of the first and second injections, your doctor will probably recommend that you do/ your child does not receive Ambirix.
Instead, you/ your child will probably need to have three injections of a combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine that has a lower content in each dose of the active substances (360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).
The second of the three doses of this lower dose vaccine is usually given at one month after the first dose, and it is more likely to protect you/ your child against hepatitis B before the course is completed.
Your doctor will be able to advise you. • if you have/ your child has a bleeding problem or bruise/ bruises easily.
Sometimes Ambirix is given as an injection just under the skin instead of into muscle in people who have severe bleeding problems. • if you have/ your child has a poor immune system due to illness or treatment or if you are/ your child is receiving haemodialysis.
Ambirix can still be given but these people may not have a good response to the vaccine and it may be necessary to do a blood test to see how well they have responded.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines (including any that you may have obtained without a prescription) or if you have recently had or expect to shortly have any other vaccinations or injections of immunoglobulins (antibodies).
Ask your doctor if you are not sure.
People who are taking medicines that decrease the body’ s immunity to infections can still have Ambirix if this is thought to be necessary but may not have a good immune response to the vaccine and so may not be protected against one or both of hepatitis A and B viruses.
Ambirix can be given at the same time as vaccine containing measles, mumps and rubella viruses and vaccines that are intended to protect you against one or more of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), poliomyelitis or Haemophilus influenzae type b.
Ambirix can be given at the same
21 time as other vaccines if this is thought to be very necessary.
If another vaccine is to be given at the same time as Ambirix, separate sites and preferably different limbs should be used.
If Ambirix has to be given at the same time as or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that you will still make a good immune response to the vaccine.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are or think you may be pregnant or if you are breast-feeding.
Ambirix is not usually given to women who are pregnant or breast-feeding unless it is urgent for them to be vaccinated against both hepatitis A and B.
Driving and using machines
Drowsiness and dizziness have sometimes occurred after having Ambirix or a similar vaccine.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Ambirix Please tell your doctor if you have had an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).
3.
HOW AMBIRIX IS GIVEN
You/ your child will receive a total of two injections.
These will be given within 12 months.
Each injection is given on a separate visit.
The first dose will be given on a date agreed with your doctor.
The second dose will be given between six and twelve months after the first dose.
It is not known exactly how long protection against infection with hepatits A and B viruses will last, although protection against hepatitis A virus probably lasts about 10 years.
Patients with poor immune systems may need more frequent additional doses.
Your doctor will advise on the possible need for extra doses.
If you miss/ your child misses the visit scheduled for the second injection, talk to your doctor and arrange another visit as soon as possible.
Make sure you finish/ your child finishes the complete vaccination course of two injections.
If not, you/ your child may not be fully protected against the diseases.
The doctor or nurse will give Ambirix as an injection into muscle, usually into the upper arm.
In very small children, the injection may be given into the thigh muscle.
Your doctor or nurse will take care that Ambirix is not given into a vein.
The vaccine would not usually be given deep into the skin because protection may be less.
This is usually done when there is a risk of severe bleeding after an injection into muscle.

26 ANNEX IV
GROUNDS FOR ONE ADDITIONAL RENEWAL
27 GROUNDS FOR ONE ADDITIONAL RENEWAL
Based upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Ambirix remains positive.
However, since Ambirix has only been marketed in one Member State (the Netherlands since May 2003), the safety information available for this product is limited due to a low patient exposure.
The safety profile of Ambirix should thus be further reviewed within 5 years to ensure it is fully known.
Furthermore, PSURs should continue to be submitted on a yearly basis.
Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that one additional five-year renewal on the basis of pharmacovigilance grounds is required.
