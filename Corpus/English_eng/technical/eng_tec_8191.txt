ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Renagel 400 mg film-coated tablets
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each tablet contains 400 mg sevelamer.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet The off-white, oval tablets are imprinted with Renagel 400 on one side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Renagel is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.
Renagel should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25 – dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Children The safety and efficacy of this product has not been established in patients below the age of 18 years.
Adults and elderly (> 65 years) For patients who are not on phosphate binders, dosage is determined individually based on serum phosphate concentration as indicated in the table below:
Serum phosphate level in patients not on phosphate binders
Starting dose
of Renagel 400 mg tablets
1.76 – 2.42 mmol/ l (5.5-7.5 mg/ dl) 2.42 – 2.91 mmol/ l (7.5-9 mg/ dl) > 2.91 mmol/ l (> 9 mg/ dl)
2 tablets, 3 times per day 3 tablets,3 times per day 4 tablets, 3 times per day
If Renagel is prescribed as an alternative phosphate binder, Renagel should be given in equivalent doses on a mg weight basis compared to the patient’ s previous calcium based phosphate binder.
Serum phosphate levels should be closely monitored and the dose of Renagel adjusted accordingly with the goal of lowering serum phosphate to 1.76 mmol/ l (5.5mg/ dl) or less.
Serum phosphate should be tested every two to three weeks until a stable serum phosphate level is reached and on a regular basis thereafter.
The dose range may vary between 1 and 10 capsules per meal.
The average actual daily dose used in the chronic phase of a one year clinical study was 7 grams of sevelamer.
Patients should take Renagel with meals and adhere to their prescribed diets.
The capsules must be swallowed whole.
2 4.3 Contra-indications
• Hypersensitivity to sevelamer or to any of the excipients.. • Hypophosphataemia or bowel obstruction.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Efficacy and safety of Renagel has not been studied in children or in predialysis patients.
The safety and efficacy of Renagel has not been studied in patients with swallowing disorders, untreated or severe gastroparesis, and retention of gastric contents.
Renagel should only be used in these patients following careful assessment of benefit and risks.
Efficacy and safety of Renagel has not been studied in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal motility disorders, abnormal or irregular bowel motion and patients with a history of major gastrointestinal surgery.
Consequently, caution should be exercised when Renagel is used in patients with these disorders.
In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/ subileus have been observed in patients during treatment with Renagel.
Constipation may be a preceding symptom.
Patients who are constipated should be monitored carefully while being treated with Renagel.
Renagel treatment should be re- evaluated in patients who develop severe constipation or other severe gastrointestinal symptoms.
Renagel alone is not indicated for the control of hyperparathyroidism.
In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism Renagel should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25 - dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels.
Patients with renal insufficiency may develop hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia.
Renagel does not contain calcium.
Serum calcium levels should be monitored as is done in normal follow-up of a dialysis patient.
Elemental calcium should be given as a supplement in case of hypocalcaemia.
Depending on diet intake and the nature of end stage renal failure, dialysis patients may develop low vitamin A, D, E and K levels.
In preclinical studies, sevelamer at the equivalent of 10 times the maximal human dose has been shown to reduce the absorption of vitamins D, E and K, and folic acid (see also 5.3 Preclinical safety data).
Therefore, in patients not taking these vitamins, monitoring vitamin A, D and E levels and assessing vitamin K status through the measurement of thromboplastin time should be considered and the vitamins should be supplemented if necessary.
Additional monitoring of vitamins and folic acid is recommended in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, since in the clinical study, vitamin A, D, E and K levels were not measured in these patients.
There is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term Renagel treatment.
Serum chloride may increase during Renagel treatment as chloride may be exchanged for phosphorus in the intestinal lumen.
Although no clinically significant serum chloride increase has been observed in the clinical studies, serum chloride should be monitored as is done in the routine follow-up of a dialysis patient.
One gram of Renagel contains approximately 180 mg (5.1mEq) chloride.
Patients with chronic renal failure are predisposed to developing metabolic acidosis.
Worsening of acidosis has been reported upon switching from other phosphate binders to sevelamer in a number of studies where lower bicarbonate levels in the sevelamer-treated patients compared to patients treated with calcium-based binders were observed.
Closer monitoring of serum bicarbonate levels is therefore recommended.
3 Very rare cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in patients co-administered Renagel and Levothyroxine.
Closer monitoring of TSH levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving both medicinal products.
Patients taking anti-arrhythmic medications for the control of arrhythmias and anti-seizure medications for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from clinical trials.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing Renagel to patients also taking these medications.
Patients receiving dialysis are subject to certain risks for infection specific to the dialysis modality.
Peritonitis is a known complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) and in a clinical study with Renagel, a number of peritonitis cases were reported.
Therefore, patients on PD should be closely monitored to ensure the reliable use of appropriate aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis.
As data on the chronic use of sevelamer for over one year are not yet available, potential absorption and accumulation of sevelamer during long-term chronic treatment cannot be totally excluded (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetics).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have not been conducted in patients on dialysis.
In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, Renagel had no effect on the bioavailability of digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol.
However, the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin was decreased by approximately 50% when co-administered with Renagel in a single dose study.
Consequently, Renagel should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin.
Renagel may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products.
Reduced levels of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant patients when coadministered with Renagel without any clinical consequences (i. e graft rejection).
The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood concentrations of mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin and tacrolimus should be considered during the use of combination and after its withdrawal.
When administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after Renagel, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The safety of Renagel has not been established in pregnant or lactating women.
In animal studies there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryo-foetal toxicity.
Renagel should only be given to pregnant or lactating women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/ benefit analysis has been conducted for both the mother and the foetus or infant (See 5.3 Preclinical safety data).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In parallel design studies involving 244 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of up to 54 weeks and 97 peritoneal dialysis patients with treatment duration of 12 weeks, the most frequently occurring (≥ 5% of patients) undesirable effects possibly or probably related to Renagel were all in the gastrointestinal disorders system organ class.
Data possibly or probably related to Renagel from these studies (299 patients) and from uncontrolled clinical trials (384 patients) are listed by frequency in the table below.
The reporting rate is classified as very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10),
4 uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000), very rare (< 1/ 10,000), including isolated reports.
Gastrointestinal disorders Very common (≥ 1/ 10):
Nausea, vomiting Common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10):
Diarrhoea, dyspepsia, flatulence, upper abdominal pain, constipation
Most of these events are commonly observed in patients Stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease and are not necessarily attributable to Renagel.
Post-marketing experience:
In very rare cases, intestinal obstruction and ileus/ subileus have been observed in patients during treatment with Renagel.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.
Renagel has been given to normal healthy volunteers in doses up to 14 grams, the equivalent of thirty- five 403 mg capsules (equivalent to thirty-five 400 mg tablets), per day for eight days with no undesirable effects.
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Treatment of hyperphosphatemia.
ATC code:
V03AE02.
Renagel contains sevelamer, a non-absorbed phosphate binding poly(allylamine hydrochloride) polymer, free of metal and calcium.
It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone.
These amines become partially protonated in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding.
By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract, sevelamer lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum.
In clinical trials, selevamer has been shown to be effective in reducing serum phosphorus in patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.
Sevelamer decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic episodes as compared to patients using calcium based phosphate binders alone, probably because the product itself does not contain calcium.
The effects on phosphate and calcium were proven to be maintained throughout a study with one year follow-up.
Sevelamer has been shown to bind bile acids in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models.
Bile acid binding by ion exchange resins is a well-established method of lowering blood cholesterol.
In clinical trials mean total and LDL cholesterol declined by 15-31%.
This effect is observed after 2 weeks is maintained with long-term treatment.
Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and albumin did not change.
In the clinical studies in haemodialysis patients, sevelamer alone did not have a consistent and clinically significant effect on serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH).
In the 12 week study involving peritoneal dialysis patients however, similar iPTH reductions were seen compared with patients receiving calcium acetate.
In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism Renagel should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements, 1,25 – dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to lower the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels.
5 In a clinical trial of one-year duration, Renagel had no adverse effect on bone turnover or mineralisation compared to calcium carbonate.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Renagel is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract according to a single dose pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers.
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been carried out in renal failure patients (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, Renagel at a dose of 10 times the maximum human doses reduced absorption of fat soluble vitamins D, E and K, and folic acid.
In a study in rats, administering sevelamer in 15-30 x the human dose, an increase in serum copper was detected.
This was not confirmed in a dog study or in clinical trials.
Currently, no formal carcinogenicity data are available.
However, in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that Renagel does not have genotoxic potential.
Also the medicinal product is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.
In reproduction studies there was no evidence that sevelamer induced embryolethality, foetotoxicity or teratogenicity at the doses tested (up to 1 g/ kg/ day in rabbits and up to 4.5 g/ kg/ day in rats).
Deficits in skeletal ossification were observed in several locations in fetuses of female rats dosed with sevelamer at 8-20 times the maximum human dose of 200 mg/ kg.
The effects may be secondary to vitamin D and/ or vitamin K depletion at these high doses.

Further information.
1.
WHAT RENAGEL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Renagel contains sevelamer as the active ingredient.
It binds phosphate from food in the digestive tract and so reduces serum phosphate levels in the blood.
Renagel is used to control the levels of phosphate in the blood of adult kidney failure patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment.
Renagel does not contain calcium.
Episodes of high calcium levels in your blood will therefore be fewer than when calcium tablets alone are taken to regulate your blood phosphate levels.
Renagel also binds bile acids and so reduces the levels of LDL (‘ bad’) cholesterol in your blood.
It may be necessary to use other medicines with Renagel, which could include calcium or vitamin D supplements, to control the development of renal bone disease.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE RENAGEL
Do not take Renagel if you: • have low levels of phosphate in your blood • have bowel obstruction. • are allergic (hypersensitive) to sevelamer or to any of the other ingredients of the product (see Section 6:
Further information).
Take special care with Renagel Children:
The safety and efficacy in children has not been established.
Therefore if you are below the age of 18 years you should consult your doctor before taking Renagel.
45 Adults:
If any of the following applies to you, please consult your doctor before taking Renagel: • you are not on dialysis • swallowing problems • problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel • retention of stomach contents • active inflammation of the bowel • have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel.
Additional treatments:
Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: • develop a low or high level of calcium in your blood.
Since Renagel does not contain calcium your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. • have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood.
Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels of vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary.
If you do not take multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in your blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental vitamins as necessary.
Changing treatment:
When you switch from another phosphate binder to Renagel, your doctor might consider monitoring the levels of bicarbonate in your blood more closely because Renagel may decrease the levels of bicarbonate.
Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal dialysis.
This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes.
You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal distress, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.
You should expect to be monitored more carefully for problems with low levels of vitamins A, D, E, K and folic acid.
Taking other medicines Always mention to your doctor all medicines you are taking or have recently taken, even those obtained without a prescription.
Renagel should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic).
If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your doctor when taking Renagel.
The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus (medicines used in transplant patients) may be reduced by Renagel.
Your doctor will advise you if you are taking these medicines.
Your doctor will check for interactions between Renagel and other medicines on a regular basis.
Taking Renagel with food and drink You should take Renagel tablets with meals.
However, you should adhere to your prescribed diet and liquid intake.
Do not chew.
The tablets must be swallowed whole.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, you should ask your doctor or pharmacist before taking Renagel.
46 Driving and using machines Renagel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to operate machines.
3.
HOW TO TAKE RENAGEL
You should take Renagel as prescribed by your doctor.
He/ she will base the dose on your serum phosphate level.
The recommended starting dose of Renagel for adults and the elderly (> 65 years) is two to four tablets with each meal 3 times a day.
In some cases where Renagel should be administered at the same time as another drug.
Your doctor may advise you to take this drug 1 hour before or 3 hours after Renagel intake, or he/ she may consider monitoring the blood levels of that drug.
Your doctor will check the levels of phosphate in your blood periodically and he/ she may adjust the dose of Renagel when necessary (between 1 and 10 tablets of 400 mg per meal) to reach an adequate phosphate level.
If you take more Renagel than you should There are no reported overdoses in patients.
In the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately.
If you forget to take Renagel If you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the usual time with a meal.
Do not take two doses at the same time.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Renagel can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
The following side effects have been reported in patients taking Renagel:
Very common (likely to occur in more than 1 in 10 patients): nausea, vomiting.
Common (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 patients and more than 1 in 100 patients): diarrhoea, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence Very rare (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10,000 patients): intestinal obstruction.
Most of these events are also commonly observed in patients with chronic kidney disease and are not necessarily due to Renagel.
Since constipation may be a preceding symptom in very rare cases of intestinal obstruction, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
5.
HOW TO STORE RENAGEL

1.
WHAT RENAGEL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Renagel contains sevelamer as the active ingredient.
It binds phosphate from food in the digestive tract and so reduces serum phosphate levels in the blood.
Renagel is used to control the levels of phosphate in the blood of adult kidney failure patients on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis treatment.
Renagel does not contain calcium.
Episodes of high calcium levels in your blood will therefore be fewer than when calcium tablets alone are taken to regulate your blood phosphate levels.
Renagel also binds bile acids and so reduces the levels of LDL (‘ bad’) cholesterol in your blood.
It may be necessary to use other medicines with Renagel, which could include calcium or vitamin D supplements, to control the development of renal bone disease.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE RENAGEL
Do not take Renagel if you: • have low levels of phosphate in your blood • have bowel obstruction. • are allergic (hypersensitive) to sevelamer or to any of the other ingredients of the product (see Section 6:
Further information).
Take special care with Renagel Children:
The safety and efficacy in children has not been established.
Therefore if you are below the age of 18 years you should consult your doctor before taking Renagel.
50 Adults:
If any of the following applies to you, please consult your doctor before taking Renagel: • you are not on dialysis • swallowing problems • problems with motility (movement) in your stomach and bowel • retention of stomach contents • active inflammation of the bowel • have undergone major surgery on your stomach or bowel.
Additional treatments:
Due to either your kidney condition or your dialysis treatment you may: • develop a low or high level of calcium in your blood.
Since Renagel does not contain calcium your doctor might prescribe additional calcium tablets. • have a low amount of vitamin D in your blood.
Therefore, your doctor may monitor the levels of vitamin D in your blood and prescribe additional vitamin D as necessary.
If you do not take multivitamin supplements you may also develop low levels of vitamins A, E, K and folic acid in your blood and therefore your doctor may monitor these levels and prescribe supplemental vitamins as necessary.
Changing treatment:
When you switch from another phosphate binder to Renagel, your doctor might consider monitoring the levels of bicarbonate in your blood more closely because Renagel may decrease the levels of bicarbonate.
Special note for patients on peritoneal dialysis You may develop peritonitis (infection of your abdominal fluid) associated with your peritoneal dialysis.
This risk can be reduced by careful adherence to sterile techniques during bag changes.
You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any new signs or symptoms of abdominal distress, abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or abdominal rigidity, constipation, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.
You should expect to be monitored more carefully for problems with low levels of vitamins A, D, E, K and folic acid.
Taking other medicines Always mention to your doctor all medicines you are taking or have recently taken, even those obtained without a prescription.
Renagel should not be taken at the same time as ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic).
If you are taking medicines for heart rhythm problems or for epilepsy, you should consult your doctor when taking Renagel.
The effects of medicines such as ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus (medicines used in transplant patients) may be reduced by Renagel.
Your doctor will advise you if you are taking these medicines.
Your doctor will check for interactions between Renagel and other medicines on a regular basis.
Taking Renagel with food and drink You should take Renagel tablets with meals.
However, you should adhere to your prescribed diet and liquid intake.
Do not chew.
The tablets must be swallowed whole.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, you should ask your doctor or pharmacist before taking Renagel.
51 Driving and using machines Renagel is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or to operate machines.
3.
HOW TO TAKE RENAGEL
You should take Renagel as prescribed by your doctor.
He/ she will base the dose on your serum phosphate level.
The recommended starting dose of Renagel for adults and the elderly (> 65 years) is one or two tablets with each meal 3 times a day.
In some cases where Renagel should be administered at the same time as another drug.
Your doctor may advise you to take this drug 1 hour before or 3 hours after Renagel intake, or he/ she may consider monitoring the blood levels of that drug.
Your doctor will check the levels of phosphate in your blood periodically and he/ she may adjust the dose of Renagel when necessary (between 1 and 5 tablets of 800 mg per meal) to reach an adequate phosphate level.
If you take more Renagel than you should There are no reported overdoses in patients.
In the event of a possible overdose you should contact your doctor immediately.
If you forget to take Renagel If you have missed one dose, this dose should be omitted and the next dose should be taken at the usual time with a meal.
Do not take two doses at the same time.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Renagel can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
The following side effects have been reported in patients taking Renagel:
Very common (likely to occur in more than 1 in 10 patients): nausea, vomiting Common (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10 patients and more than 1 in 100 patients): diarrhoea, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence.
Very rare (likely to occur in fewer than 1 in 10,000 patients): intestinal obstruction.
Most of these events are also commonly observed in patients with chronic kidney disease and are not necessarily due to Renagel.
