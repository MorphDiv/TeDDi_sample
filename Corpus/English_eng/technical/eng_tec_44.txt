Bubble
A bubble chart shows the relations of three variables.
Two variables are used for the position on the x-axis and y-axis, while the third variable is shown as the relative size of each bubble.
The data series dialogue box for a bubble chart has an entry to define the data range for the Bubble Sizes.
