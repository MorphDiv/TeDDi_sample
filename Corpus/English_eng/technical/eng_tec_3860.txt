(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a positive mSQL link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
msql_connect() establishes a connection to a mSQL server.
The server parameter can also include a port number. eg. "hostname:port".
It defaults to 'localhost'.
In case a second call is made to msql_connect() with the same arguments, no new link will be established, but instead, the link identifier of the already opened link will be returned.
The link to the server will be closed as soon as the execution of the script ends, unless it' s closed earlier by explicitly calling msql_close().
See also msql_pconnect(), msql_close().
