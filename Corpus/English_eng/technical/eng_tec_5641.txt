The Thesaurus Tab
The Thesaurus tab offers a small thesaurus, built from a subset of wordnet;. The results are listed in three categories: Synonyms, More General Words (hypernyms), More Specific Words (hyponyms). Synonyms are words with a very similar meaning. They do not necessarily apply to all senses of each word, so you cannot always replace a word with any synonym.
You can double click on a word to search for its synonyms & etc;. You can also type a word directly into the Search for: box at the top and press Return. The word which is currently visible in the Replace with: box at the bottom is the one that will be used if you click on Replace.
& kthesaurus; can be used as a standalone application, but it can also be used from other applications (like & kword;, typically by right clicking on a word and selecting Show related words). The Replace with: button will only be visible if & kthesaurus; is called from another application.
We have to keep the data file small so that it can be included in & koffice; & mdash; this introduces several limitations (compared to & wordnet;):
Only exact matches are found, & eg; if you search for a plural form nothing will be found.
Many not so common words have been removed.
It does n't distinguish between parts of speech, & eg; verbs and nouns are mixed up in the lists of words.
It wo n't separate the different meanings words can have.
Adjectives do n't really have a more general / more specific meaning, so one word may appear in more than one list at the same time.
On the other hand, a few words have been added (function words like if and very few words specific to & kde;).
Please do not report bugs in the thesaurus to the & wordnet; project, but to & kde;.
Using languages besides English
By default, only the English language is supported in & kthesaurus;. You can check out the & koffice; download page to see which other languages are available.
The & wordnet; tab
The wordnet; tab provides a user interface to a local installation of wordnet; 1.7. & wordnet; is an online lexical reference system whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory. The & kthesaurus; user interface offers nearly all options which are available on the command line. It calls the wn binary, which has to be in your PATH.
To learn more about & wordnet;, please see the & wordnet; man pages or have a look at the wordnet; homepage.
