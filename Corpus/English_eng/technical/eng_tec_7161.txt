Default gamma for the display
The default target gamma value for the display. Common values are 1.8, 2.2 and 2.4.
Default display target whitepoint
The default target whitepoint in Kelvin for display calibration, with 0 meaning display native. Common values are 6500 for D65 and 5000 for D50.
Delay between sample intervals
This is the delay between setting the sample color and asking the measuring instrument to take a sample. It is required because both the graphics driver and the display itself introduce latency.
Web service profile upload URI
The URI of the web service that allows the calibration tools to upload a specific profile to the Internet.
Compatible with Adobe RGB (1998)
This profile is free of known copyright restrictions
This editing space was designed as SMPTE-240M and encompasses most of the possible colors available on a CMYK color printer. This is a popular choice for editing photographs and for use in printing, as all the SWOP colors can be reproduced.
This legacy profile was originally created by Adobe for use with Photoshop and Illustrator. As it is based on the original Apple 13" RGB monitor and is similar to sRGB, it should not be used as a display profile or for new images.
This editing space can display more saturated colors than Adobe RGB and is suitable for images with highly saturated colors often used in advertisements. It is very similar to DonRGB4, but can show super-saturated red colors sometimes present in Fujichrome Velvia.
This editing space can display more saturated colors than Adobe RGB. It is less prone to quantisation errors compared to ProPhoto RGB, although more shadow detail is preserved. In most instances ProPhoto RGB is probably a better choice.
Blue
This test profile is used to make all colors on the screen slightly more blue by altering the video card lookup table. This allows the user to check the calibration is being applied correctly.
This is an RGB editing space for use with Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and later. It was designed as an output-centric compromise between ColorMatch RGB and Adobe RGB and used to be preferred by some photograph printing services.
This theoretical profile is designed for use in color experiments. You probably don't want to use this profile as a editing space or a display profile.
This profile was designed by Radius for the PressView monitor. Only use this profile as a display profile or as a editing space as the profile is not significantly different to sRGB. You should only need to use this profile if viewing images created on a PressView monitor.
Crayon Colors
This named color profile contains all the Crayola crayon colors in popular use. It is a test profile designed for testing embedding named colors into documents.
This editing space can display more saturated colors than Adobe RGB and is suitable for images with highly saturated colors often used in advertisements.
This profile is recommended by the ECI (European Color Initiative) as a editing space for professional image editing and aims to cover all colors that can be printed on printing presses. This is sometimes used as a color data exchange format between publishers and printing houses.
This profile was designed with a lightness gamma curve which means the monitor will have to be also calibrated in the same way. This profile is only useful for advanced users and is not recommended for general use.
This profile was designed for storing archives of scanned transparency film. It is suitable for storing images from color negatives, although nowadays ProPhoto RGB is a more popular profile for archival.
FOGRA27L Coated
This profile is used for positive plate making, printing on paper types 1 and 2 (coated or matte), sheetfed offset. This profile set should no longer be used for production, use FOGRA39L instead.
FOGRA28L Web Coated
This profile is used for positive plate making, printing on paper type 3 (LWC), webfed offset. This profile should no longer be used for production, use FOGRA45 instead.
FOGRA29L Uncoated
This profile is used for positive plate making, printing on paper type 4 (uncoated white), sheetfed offset. This profile should no longer be used for production, use FOGRA47 instead.
FOGRA30L Uncoated Yellowish
This profile is used for positive plate making, printing on paper type 5 (uncoated yellowish), sheetfed offset.
FOGRA39L Coated
This profile is used for printing on paper types 1 and 2 (coated or matte), sheetfed offset. This profile is not significantly different from U.S. GRACoL 2006 (TR 006).
FOGRA40L SC Paper
This profile is used for printing on SC (supercalendered) paper, webfed offset. There is no known U.S. equivalent.
FOGRA45L Lightweight Coated
This ISO 12647-2:2004 compliant profile is used for printing on improved light-weight coated (LWC) paper for 60 l/cm heatset web offset printing. It replaces FOGRA28L.
FOGRA47L Uncoated
This ISO 12647-2 compliant profile is used for printing on 115 gsm uncoated white (paper type 4) for 60 l/cm sheetfed offset printing.
GRACoL TR006 Coated
This profile is used for printing on U.S. grade 1 and 2 coated paper, sheetfed offset and gravure. It is the U.S. equivalent of FOGRA39.
IFRA26S 2004 Newsprint
This profile is use for printing on newsprint, and is an ISO12647-3:2005 compliant profile designed for a printing press exhibiting 26% TVI (dot gain). It is recommended by WAN-IFRA for coldset printing on newsprint worldwide.
This profile defines the range of colors used with the NTSC video standard. It is an obsolete standard that has been replaced by SMTE-C. You should only use this profile to decode archived video.
This profile defines the range of colors used with the PAL and SECAM video standards and is very similar to sRGB. You should only use this profile to encode or decode video.
Originally designed by Eastman Kodak and called ROMM RGB, this profile can display a very large range of colors and is used by many photographers for rendering, editing and archiving RAW images. Unless you are working with 16 bits per channel precision, you may see color banding when editing images.
ITU-R recommendation BT.709 is a high-definition television standard that was first approved in 1990. The Rec. 709 profile uses the same range of colors as sRGB although the luminance curve is different.
This is the current standard used by North America and Japan for studio recording. You should only use this profile to encode or decode video.
SNAP TR002 Newsprint
This is an ANSI CGATS/SNAP TR 002-2007 based profile for printing on newsprint in the U.S., coldset offset. The TVI (dot gain) is 26%.
This general purpose profile was designed by Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft and lives on as the default profile on the Internet for untagged RGB colors and used in HDTV. Most uncalibrated displays are able to display most of the colors available in sRGB, although this profile is sometimes a poor choice for printing.
Swapped Red and Green
This test profile swaps the red and green channels and is useful as a visual check that profiles are being applied correctly. If this profile is applied twice, the image looks unchanged.
SWOP TR003 Coated
This profile is used for printing on U.S. grade 3 coated paper, sheetfed offset and gravure. It is used for high quality magazine printing with white paper.
SWOP TR005 Coated
This profile is used for printing on U.S. grade 5 coated paper, sheetfed offset and gravure. It is use for standard magazine printing with yellowish paper.
Wide Gamut RGB
This editing space was designed by Adobe Systems to capture many more colors than Adobe RGB. This profile is used to print to devices such as film recorders and can define many colors that cannot be displayed on a computer screen. Unless you are working with 16 bits per channel precision, you may see color banding when editing images.
X11 Colors
This named color profile contains all the colors defined by X11, assuming the source colors were supposed to be sRGB.
