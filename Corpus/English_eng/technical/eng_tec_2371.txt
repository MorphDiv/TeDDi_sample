(PHP 4)
array_reverse() takes input array and returns a new array with the order of the elements reversed, preserving the keys if preserve_keys is TRUE.
Example 1. array_reverse() example
$input = array ("php", 4.0, array ("green", "red")); $result = array_reverse ($input); $result_keyed = array_reverse ($input, TRUE);
This makes both $result and $result_keyed have the same elements, but note the difference between the keys.
The printout of $result and $result_keyed will be:
Array ([0] = Array ([0] = green [1] = red) [1] = 4 [2] = php) Array ([2] = Array ([0] = green [1] = red) [1] = 4 [0] = php)
Note:
The second parameter was added in PHP 4.0.3.
