(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns the type of the file.
Possible values are fifo, char, dir, block, link, file, and unknown.
Returns FALSE if an error occurs. filetype() will also produce an E_NOTICE message if the stat call fails or if the file type is unknown.
The results of this function are cached.
See clearstatcache() for more details.
This function will not work on remote files; the file to be examined must be accessible via the server's filesystem.
See also: is_dir(), is_file(), is_link(), file_exists(), and stat().
