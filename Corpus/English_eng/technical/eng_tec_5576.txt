Phone number:
& Add...
& Remove
Specifies the phone numbers to dial. You can supply multiple numbers here, simply click on "Add". You can arrange the order the numbers are tried by using the arrow buttons. When a number is busy or fails, kppp will try the next number and so on
Authentication:
Script-based
PAP
Terminal-based
CHAP
PAP/ CHAP
Specifies the method used to identify yourself to the PPP server. Most universities still use Terminal- or Script-based authentication, while most ISP use PAP and/ or CHAP. If unsure, contact your ISP. If you can choose between PAP and CHAP, choose CHAP, because it is much safer. If you do not know whether PAP or CHAP is right, choose PAP/ CHAP.
Store & password
When this is turned on, your ISP password will be saved in kppp's config file, so you do not need to type it in every time. Warning: your password will be stored as plain text in the config file, which is readable only to you. Make sure nobody gains access to this file!

Customize & pppd Arguments...
Here you can select commands to run at certain stages of the connection. The commands are run with your real user id, so you cannot run any commands here requiring root permissions (unless, of course, you are root). Be sure to supply the whole path to the program otherwise kppp might be unable to find it.
& Before connect:
Allows you to run a program before a connection is established. It is called immediately before dialing has begun. This might be useful, e. g. to stop HylaFAX blocking the modem.
& Upon connect:
Allows you to run a program after a connection is established. When your program is called, all preparations for an Internet connection are finished. Very useful for fetching mail and news
Before & disconnect:
Allows you to run a program before a connection is closed. The connection will stay open until the program exits.
Upon disconnect:
Allows you to run a program after a connection has been closed.
Configuration
Dynamic IP address
Select this option when your computer gets an internet address (IP) every time a connection is made. Almost every Internet Service Provider uses this method, so this should be turned on.
Static IP address
Select this option when your computer has a fixed internet address (IP). Most computers do not have one, so you should probably select dynamic IP addressing unless you know what you are doing.
& IP address:
If your computer has a permanent internet address, you must supply your IP address here.
& Subnet mask:
If your computer has a static Internet address, you must supply a network mask here. In almost all cases this netmask will be 255.255.255.0, but your mileage may vary. If unsure, contact your Internet Service Provider
& Auto-configure hostname from this IP
Whenever you connect, this reconfigures your hostname to match the IP address you got from the PPP server. This may be useful if you need to use a protocol which depends on this information, but it can also cause several problems. Do not enable this unless you really need it.
Selecting this option might cause some weird problems with the X-server and applications while kppp is connected. Do not use it unless you know what you are doing. For more information take a look at the handbook (or help) in the "Frequently asked questions" section.
Warning
Domain & name:
If you enter a domain name here, this domain name is used for your computer while you are connected. When the connection is closed, the original domain name of your computer is restored. If you leave this field blank, no changes are made to the domain name.
Configuration:
Automatic
Manual
DNS & IP address:
Allows you to specify a new DNS server to be used while you are connected. When the connection is closed, this DNS entry will be removed again. To add a DNS server, type in the IP address of the DNS server here and click on Add
& Add
Click this button to add the DNS server specified in the field above. The entry will then be added to the list below
Click this button to remove the selected DNS server entry from the list below
DNS address & list:
This shows all defined DNS servers to use while you are connected. Use the Add and Remove buttons to modify the list
& Disable existing DNS servers during connection
When this option is selected, all DNS servers specified in / etc/ resolv. conf are temporary disabled while the dialup connection is established. After the connection is closed, the servers will be re-enabled Typically, there is no reason to use this option, but it may become useful under some circumstances.
Default gateway
This makes the PPP peer computer (the computer you are connected to with your modem) to act as a gateway. Your computer will send all packets not going to a computer inside your local net to this computer, which will route these packets. This is the default for most ISPs, so you should probably leave this option on.
Static gateway
Allows you to specify which computer you want to use as gateway (see Default Gateway above)
Gateway & IP address:
& Assign the default route to this gateway
If this option is enabled, all packets not going to the local net are routed through the PPP connection. Normally, you should turn this on
& Insert
Add Phone Number
Enter a phone number:
pppd version:
pppd & timeout:
sec
kppp will wait this number of seconds to see if a PPP connection is established. If no connection is made in this time frame, kppp will give up and kill pppd.
Dock into panel on connect
After a connection is established, the window is minimized and a small icon in the KDE panel represents this window. Clicking on this icon will restore the window to its original location and size.
Automatic redial on disconnect
When a connection is established and it somehow gets disconnected, kppp will try to reconnect to the same account. See here for more on this topic.
Automatic redial on NO & CARRIER
When dialing if modem returns NO CARRIER the program will make a new attempt to redial instead of waiting for user to click < CANCEL > button.
& Show clock on caption
When this option is checked, the window title shows the time since a connection was established. Very useful, so you should turn this on
Disconnect on X server shutdown
Checking this option will close any open connection when the X-server is shut down. You should enable this option unless you know what you are doing. See here for more on this.
& Quit on disconnect
When this option is turned on, kppp will be closed when you disconnect
Minimize window on connect
Iconifies kppp's window when a connection is established
Modem & name:
Type in a unique name for this modem
Modem device:
This specifies the serial port your modem is attached to. On Linux/ x86, typically this is either / dev/ ttyS0 (COM1 under DOS) or / dev/ ttyS1 (COM2 under DOS). If you have an internal ISDN card with AT command emulation (most cards under Linux support this), you should select one of the / dev/ ttyIx devices.
& Flow control:
Software [XON/ XOFF]
Specifies how the serial port and modem communicate. You should not change this unless you know what you are doing. Default: CRTSCTS
& Line termination:
Specifies how AT commands are sent to your modem. Most modems will work fine with the default CR/ LF. If your modem does not react to the init string, you should try different settings here Default: CR/ LF
Connection speed:
Specifies the speed your modem and the serial port talk to each other. You should begin with at least 115200 bits/ sec (or more if you know that your serial port supports higher speeds). If you have connection problems, try to reduce this value.
& Use lock file
To prevent other programs from accessing the modem while a connection is established, a file can be created to indicate that the modem is in use. On Linux an example file would be / var/ lock/ LCK.. ttyS1 Here you can select whether this locking will be done. Default: On
Modem & timeout:
This specifies how long kppp waits for a CONNECT response from your modem. The recommended value is 30 seconds.
& Wait for dial tone before dialing
Normally the modem waits for a dial tone from your phone line, indicating that it can start to dial a number. If your modem does not recognize this sound, or your local phone system does not emit such a tone, uncheck this option Default:: On
Busy wait:
Specifies the number of seconds to wait before redial if all dialed numbers are busy. This is necessary because some modems get stuck if the same number is busy too often. The default is 0 seconds, you should not change this unless you need to.
Modem & volume:
Most modems have a speaker which makes a lot of noise when dialing. Here you can either turn this completely off or select a lower volume. If this does not work for your modem, you must modify the modem volume command.
Modem asserts CD line
This controls how kppp detects that the modem is not responding. Unless you are having problems with this, do not modify this setting. Default: Off
Modem Commands...
Allows you to change the AT command for your modem.
& Query Modem...
Most modems support the ATI command set to find out vendor and revision of your modem. Press this button to query your modem for this information. It can be useful to help you set up the modem
& Terminal...
Opens the built-in terminal program. You can use this if you want to play around with your modem's AT command set

Notice that the remote system has sent the following message: "%1" This may give you a hint why the connection has failed.
Unable to provide help.
KPPP could not prepare a PPP log. It is very likely that pppd was started without the "debug" option. Without this option it is difficult to find out PPP problems, so in general the debug option should be used. Enable debug now, and restart pppd?
Restart pppd
Do Not Restart
The "debug" option has been added. You should now try to reconnect. If that fails again, you will get a PPP log that may help you to track down the connection problem.
