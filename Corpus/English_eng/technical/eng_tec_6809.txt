Global & kppp; settings
The changes made here affect all accounts you have set up in & kppp;
The Accounts tab
The Accounts tab
The Accounts tab
The Accounts tab
In this dialog, you can manage the accounts themselves. The names of the accounts appear in a list on the left of the dialog.
To delete an account, select the Delete button. You will be asked to confirm before the account is finally deleted.
You can make a copy of an account with the Copy button. You could use this for example, to separate different users in the family, although that would normally be better done by having them be different users in the OS as well! Or perhaps you just have more than one account with the same ISP and wish to use both of them.
Choosing Edit... will take you to the dialog described in Dialog Setup, but with the selected accounts details.
Choosing New... will offer you the choice between the Wizard or the Dialog Setup already described.
If you select an account, and you have turned on accounting then the accumulated information for that account will appear in the two panels labelled Phone Costs: and Volume: respectively.
To the left of the accounting display, are two buttons: Reset... and View Logs.
Pressing Reset... will reset the Phone Costs: and Volume: information to 0. You would typically want to do this once a month or quarter, when you have received your phone bill and reconciled the telephone costs. You can reset either independently, and are offered the choice of which item you want to reset, when you press the Reset button.
Pressing View Logs will open another window, where a log of all the calls made with & kppp; will be displayed. If you have kept logs, you can move forward and backward, in monthly steps. This might be useful if you have received an abnormally large phone bill and are investigating why!

The Device tab
The Device tab
Here you can select and configure your modem.
Modem Device
Choose the device appropriate for your hardware.
/ dev/ ttys0
DOS or & Windows; users will know this as COM1, while COM2 is / dev/ ttys1 and so on. These devices are the ones normally used on & Linux; systems.
/ dev/ cua0
The first serial line (COM1). COM2 is usually / dev/ cua1 and so on. These devices are commonly used on BSD systems, namely FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. Older & Linux; systems may also have these, although on & Linux; they were renamed some time ago to / dev/ ttyS x.
/ dev/ ttyI0
On & Linux; these belong to internal ISDN cards. These devices emulate a common Hayes compatible modem. / dev/ ttyI0 is for the first, / dev/ ttyI1 is for the second ISDN card and so on. These devices are only available in the & Linux; version.
/ dev/ modem
Many & Linux; distributions make a symbolic link from the real modem device to / dev/ modem. You should avoid using this one.. Use the real device that it is pointing to instead.
Flow Control
Select from Hardware (CRTSCTS), Software (XON/ XOFF) and no flow control. The recommended setting is Hardware flow control.
Line Termination
Choose the correct Enter character sequence for your modem. Most modems will use CR/ LF, however some modems need a different setting. If you experience trouble while running a login script, play with this parameter.
Connection Speed
Choose from the list of connection speeds supported by your serial port. Note that the serial port supports much higher speeds than your modem in most cases. You should probably start with the highest number available, and only reduce it if you have connection problems.
Use Lock File
Activate this option if you want & kppp; to create a lockfile. Under & Linux; the folder for such a file will be / var/ lock. Programs such as mgetty depend on the existence of such lock files, and & kppp; will not work with mgetty if the lock file is not set. Make sure that you do n't use the option lock for pppd if you want & kppp; to lock the modem, since the pppd option lock will induce pppd to try to lock the modem device. Since & kppp; will have already locked the device, pppd will fail, and & kppp; will display the error pppd died unexpectedly.
Modem Timeout
This is the time in seconds that & kppp; will wait for the CONNECT response from your modem. A setting of about 30 seconds should be sufficient for most purposes.

The Modem tab
Busy Wait
This is the length of time the modem should wait before redialing, after it has received a busy signal. Note there are requirements by telecom providers in some countries, which ask you to not set this too low.
Modem volume
Use the slider to set the modem volume. Left is low volume, center is medium volume, and right is high volume. On some modems, low volume is the same as turning the volume off, and on other modems, medium and high are effectively the same thing.
Modem Commands
In this dialog you can fill in any particular commands appropriate for your modem. If you own a Hayes compatible modem, you most likely wo n't need to change any of the defaults, but you are encouraged to read the Hayes Commands Appendix in this help file. The information supplied there can be very helpful in cases where you experience trouble setting up a stable connection with your ISP's modems. In particular the two settings for Pre-Init Delay and for Post-Init Delay if you are experiencing modem lockups. These settings make & kppp; pause a little just before and just after sending the initialization string to your modem. The Pre-Init Delay will by default also send a CR, unless you have set it the delay interval to 0.
Query Modem
Pushing this button will make & kppp; ask your modem to identify itself. On success, your modems response will be displayed in a dialog. This may or may not prove to be informative, depending on your modem.
Terminal
Pushing the Terminal button will bring up a mini terminal. You can use the mini terminal to test your modem and to experiment with the negotiation protocol for initializing a ppp connection with your ISP. You no longer need a terminal program such as minicom or Seyon.

Here are some options that do n't really fit in with other sections, but can be very useful nonetheless.
pppd Version
The version number of the pppd daemon on your system.
pppd Timeout
& kppp; will wait this amount of time after running the script and starting pppd for pppd to establish a valid ppp link before giving up and killing pppd
Dock into Panel on Connect
If this option is chosen, & kppp; will dock into the panel where it will be symbolized by a small animated icon. Use the left mouse button on this icon to restore & kppp; 's window. The right mouse button will open a popup menu that offers to restore the window, show transfer statistics, or close the connection. This option overrides Minimize Window on Connect.
Automatic Redial on Disconnect
Selectintg this will have & kppp; try to reconnect if you are disconnected.
Show Clock on Caption
This will have & kppp; display the time connected on the caption of the & kppp; window, while you are online.
Disconnect on X-server shutdown
Checking this will cause & kppp; to terminate the ppp link, disconnect the modem, and terminate accounting in an orderly fashion, when the X-server shuts down. This is useful if you are prone to forgetting you are online, when you shut down the X-server, or if you simply do n't want to worry about manually disconnecting your session. If you do n't want & kppp; to hang up the modem on X-server exit, you should leave this checkbox empty. Beware that if you have accounting enabled, and you leave this option turned off, you will have an unterminated accounting entry in your logs, from each time the X-server exits and & kppp; terminates.
Quit on Disconnect
If enabled, & kppp; will exit when you disconnect from the internet. If disabled, & kppp; will stay open after disconnection.
Minimize Window on Connect
If this option is chosen, & kppp; will be minimized after a connection is established. The elapsed connection time will be shown in the taskbar.
The About tab
The About tab shows version, license, and author information about & kppp;.
