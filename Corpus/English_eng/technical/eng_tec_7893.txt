ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Zerit 15 mg hard capsule
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each hard capsule contains 15 mg of stavudine.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Hard capsule.
The hard capsule is red and yellow, opaque and imprinted with “ BMS” over a BMS code “ 1964” on one side and “ 15” on the other side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Zerit is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infected patients.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
The therapy should be initiated by a doctor experienced in the management of HIV infection (see also section 4.4).
Adults: the recommended dosage is:
Patient weight < 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
Zerit dosage 30 mg twice daily (every 12 hours) 40 mg twice daily
Adolescents, children and infants over the age of 3 months: the recommended dosage is:
Patient weight < 30 kg ≥ 30 kg
Zerit dosage 1 mg/ kg twice daily (every 12 hours) adult dosing
For optimal absorption, Zerit should be taken on an empty stomach (i. e. at least 1 hour prior to meals) but, if this is not possible, it may be taken with a light meal.
Zerit may also be administered by carefully opening the hard capsule and mixing the contents with food.
Infants under the age of 3 months: please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the powder formulation.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Dose adjustments
Peripheral neuropathy: if symptoms of peripheral neuropathy develop (usually characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands) (see section 4.4) patients should be switched to an alternative treatment regimen, if appropriate.
In the rare cases when this is
2 inappropriate, dose reduction of stavudine may be considered, while the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are under close monitoring and satisfactory virological suppression is maintained.
The possible benefits of a dose reduction should be balanced in each case against the risks - which may result from this measure (lower intracellular concentrations).
Hepatic impairment: no initial dosage adjustment is necessary.
Renal impairment: the following dosages are recommended:
Zerit dosage (according to creatinine clearance)
Patient weight
26-50 ml/ min
≤ 25 ml/ min (including dialysis dependence*)
< 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
15 mg twice daily 20 mg twice daily
15 mg every 24 hours 20 mg every 24 hours
* Patients on haemodialysis should take Zerit after the completion of haemodialysis, and at the same time on non-dialysis days.
Since urinary excretion is also a major route of elimination of stavudine in paediatric patients, the clearance of stavudine may be altered in paediatric patients with renal impairment.
Although there are insufficient data to recommend a specific dosage adjustment of Zerit in this patient population, a reduction in the dose and/ or an increase in the interval between doses proportional to the reduction for adults should be considered.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to stavudine or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Peripheral neuropathy: patients with a history of peripheral neuropathy are at increased risk for development of neuropathy.
If Zerit must be administered in this setting, careful clinical monitoring is essential.
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands.
Pancreatitis: patients with a history of pancreatitis had an incidence of approximately 5% on Zerit, as compared to approximately 2% in patients without such a history.
Patients with a high risk of pancreatitis or those receiving products known to be associated with pancreatitis should be closely followed for symptoms of this condition.
Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis has been reported with the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactatemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/ or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness).
Lactic acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure, renal failure, or motor paralysis.
Lactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment.
Treatment with NRTIs should be discontinued if there is symptomatic hyperlactatemia and metabolic/ lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels.
Caution should be exercised when administering NRTIs to any patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk.
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely (see also section 4.6).
Liver disease: hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported.
The safety and efficacy of stavudine has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver
3 disorders.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events.
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice.
If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.
In the event of rapidly elevating transaminase levels (ALT/ AST, > 5 times upper limit of normal, ULN), discontinuation of Zerit and any potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products should be considered.
Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.
Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/ or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients.
The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.
Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete.
A connection between visceral lipomatosis and Protease Inhibitors and lipoatrophy and NRTIs has been hypothesised.
A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.
Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat redistribution.
Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood glucose.
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8).
There is evidence that mitochondrial DNA toxicity may be associated with specific features of lipoatrophy in patients using stavudine.
This should be taken into account when considering initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy with stavudine.
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Infants under the age of 3 months: safety data is available from clinical trials up to 6 weeks of treatment in 179 newborns and infants < 3 months of age (see section 4.8).
Special consideration should be given to the antiretroviral treatment history and the resistance profile of the HIV strain of the mother.
Mitochondrial dysfunction: nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage.
There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/ or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.8).
The main adverse events reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).
These events are often transitory.
Some late-onset neurological disorders have been reported (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).
Whether the neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.
Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, even HIV-negative children, should
4 have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms.
These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.
Not recommended combinations: pancreatitis (fatal and nonfatal) and peripheral neuropathy (severe in some cases) have been reported in HIV infected patients receiving stavudine in association with hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients treated with antiretroviral agents and hydroxyurea; fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with stavudine, hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hence, hydroxyurea should not be used in the treatment of HIV infection.
Lactose intolerance: the hard capsule contains lactose (120 mg).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults
Since stavudine is actively secreted by the renal tubules, interactions with other actively secreted medicinal products are possible, e. g. with trimethoprim.
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction has, however, been seen with lamivudine.
Zidovudine and stavudine are phosphorylated by the cellular enzyme (thymidine kinase), which preferentially phosphorylates zidovudine, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of stavudine to its active triphosphate form.
Zidovudine is therefore not recommended to be used in combination with stavudine.
In vitro studies indicate that the activation of stavudine is inhibited by doxorubicin and ribavirin but not by other medicinal products used in HIV infection which are similarly phosphorylated, (e. g. didanosine, zalcitabine, ganciclovir and foscarnet) therefore, coadministration of stavudine with either doxorubicin or ribavirin should be undertaken with caution.
Stavudine’ s influence on the phosphorylation kinetics of nucleoside analogues other than zidovudine has not been investigated.
Clinically significant interactions of stavudine or stavudine plus didanosine with nelfinavir have not been observed.
Stavudine does not inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4; therefore, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur with drugs metabolised through these pathways.
Because stavudine is not protein-bound, it is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of protein-bound drugs.
There have been no formal interaction studies with other medicinal products.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Zerit should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Clinical experience in pregnant women is limited, but congenital anomalies and abortions have been reported.
In study AI455-094, performed in South-Africa, 362 mother-infant pairs were included in a prevention of mother-to-child-transmission study.
Treatment naive pregnant women were enrolled into the study at gestation week 34-36 and given antiretroviral treatment until delivery.
Antiretroviral prophylaxis,
5 the same medications as given to the mother, was given to the new-born infant within 36 hours of delivery and continued for 6 weeks.
In the stavudine containing arms, the neonates were treated for 6 weeks with stavudine 1 mg/ kg BID.
The follow-up time was up to 24 weeks of age.
The mother-infant pairs were randomised to receive either stavudine (N= 91), didanosine (N= 94), stavudine + didanosine (N= 88) or zidovudine (N= 89).
95% Confidence intervals for the mother-to-child-transmission rates were 5.4-19.3% (stavudine), 5.2-18.7% (didanosine); 1.3-11.2% (stavudine + didanosine); and 1.9-12.6% for zidovudine.
Preliminary safety data from this study (see also section 4.8), showed an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected in this study.
However, lactic acidosis (see section 4.4), sometimes fatal, has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with or without other anti-retroviral treatment.
Embryo-foetal toxicities were seen only at high exposure levels in animals.
Preclinical studies showed placental transfer of stavudine (see section 5.3).
Until additional data become available, Zerit should be given during pregnancy only after special consideration; there is insufficient information to recommend Zerit for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Furthermore, the combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk.
It is recommended that HIV infected women should not breast-feed under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.
The data available on stavudine excretion into human breast milk are insufficient to assess the risk to the infant.
Studies in lactating rats showed that stavudine is excreted in breast milk.
Therefore, mothers should be instructed to discontinue breast-feeding prior to receiving Zerit.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Based on the pharmacodynamic properties of stavudine it is unlikely that Zerit affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults: extensive safety experience is available for Zerit used as monotherapy and in combination regimens.
Many of the serious undesirable effects with stavudine were consistent with the course of HIV infection or with the side effects of concomitant therapies.
Peripheral neuropathy:
In combination studies of Zerit with lamivudine plus efavirenz, the frequency of peripheral neurologic symptoms was 19% (6% for moderate to severe) with a rate of discontinuation due to neuropathy of 2%.
Dose-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in monotherapy trials with Zerit (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
The patients usually experienced resolution of symptoms after dose reduction or interruption.
Pancreatitis: pancreatitis, occasionally fatal, has been reported in up to 2-3% of patients enrolled in monotherapy clinical studies (see section 4.4).
Pancreatitis was reported in < 1% of patients in combination therapy studies with Zerit.
Lactic acidosis: cases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
Hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported with the use of stavudine and with other nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
6 Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise (see section 4.4).
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia (see section 4.4).
Osteonecrosis: cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Undesirable effects (moderate to severe) were reported from 467 patients treated with Zerit in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in two randomised clinical trials and an ongoing long-term follow-up study (total follow-up: median 56 weeks ranging up to 119 weeks).
The following undesirable effects considered possibly related to study regimen based on investigators’ attribution, have been identified:
Endocrine disorders:
uncommon: gynaecomastia
Gastrointestinal disorders:
common: diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia uncommon: pancreatitis, vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions:
common: fatigue uncommon: asthenia
Hepatobiliary disorders:
uncommon: hepatitis or jaundice
Metabolism and nutrition disorders:
common: lipoatrophy, * lipodystrophy uncommon: lactic acidosis (in some cases involving motor weakness), anorexia
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
uncommon: arthralgia, myalgia
Nervous system disorders:
common: peripheral neurologic symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, and peripheral neuritis; dizziness; abnormal dreams; headache, insomnia; abnormal thinking; somnolence
Psychiatric disorders:
common: depression uncommon: anxiety, emotional lability
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
common: rash, pruritus uncommon: urticaria
7 *Lipoatrophy was observed in a long-term follow-up study of stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz (total follow-up: median 148 weeks ranging up to 207 weeks).
Discontinuation due to undesirable events was 7% for the patients treated with Zerit.
Laboratory abnormalities reported in these two trials and an ongoing follow-up study included elevations of ALT (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of AST (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of lipase (≥ 2.1 ULN) in 3% of the patients in the Zerit group.
Neutropenia (< 750 cells/ mm3) was reported in 5%, thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/ mm3) in 2%, and low haemoglobin (< 8 g/ dl) in < 1% of patients receiving Zerit.
Macrocytosis was not evaluated in these trials, but was found to be associated with Zerit in an earlier trial (MCV > 112 fl occurred in 30% of patients treated with Zerit).
Adolescents, children and infants: undesirable effects and serious laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in paediatric patients ranging in age from birth through adolescence who received stavudine in clinical studies were generally similar in type and frequency to those seen in adults.
However, clinically significant peripheral neuropathy is less frequent.
These studies include ACTG 240, where 105 paediatric patients ages 3 months to 6 years received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day for a median of 6.4 months; a controlled clinical trial where 185 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day either alone or in combination with didanosine from birth through 6 weeks of age; and a clinical trial where 8 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day in combination with didanosine and nelfinavir from birth through 4 weeks of age.
In study AI455-094 (see also section 4.6), the safety follow-up period was restricted to only six months, which may be insufficient to capture long-term data on neurological adverse events and mitochondrial toxicity.
Relevant grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities in the 91 stavudine treated infants were low neutrophils in 7%, low hemoglobin in 1%, ALT increase in 1% and no lipase abnormality.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected.
No notable differences in the frequency of adverse drug reactions were seen between treatment groups.
There was, however, an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Postmarketing
The following events have been reported spontaneously during postmarketing experience:
Blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Not known: thrombocytopenia
Metabolic and nutrition disorders:
Common: asymptomatic hyperlactatemia, Not known: lactic acidosis
Hepatobiliary disorders:
Not known: liver failure, hepatitis and hepatic steatosis
Nervous system disorders:
Not known: motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome)
Mitochondrial dysfunction: review of the postmarketing safety database shows that adverse events indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction have been reported in the neonate and infant population exposed to one or more nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.4).
The HIV status for the newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age was negative, for older infants it tended to be positive.
The profile of the adverse events for newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age showed increases in lactic acid levels, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic transaminase increases and increased lipids, including hypertriglyceridaemia.
The number of reports in older infants was too small to identify a pattern.
8 4.9 Overdose
Experience in adults treated with up to 12 times the recommended daily dosage revealed no acute toxicity.
Complications of chronic overdosage could include peripheral neuropathy and hepatic dysfunction.
The mean haemodialysis clearance of stavudine is 120 ml/ min.
The contribution of this to the total elimination in an overdose situation is unknown.
It is not known whether stavudine is removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ATC code:
J05AF04
Stavudine, a thymidine analogue, is an antiviral agent with in vitro activity against HIV in human cells.
It is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to stavudine triphosphate which inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine triphosphate.
It also inhibits viral DNA synthesis by causing DNA chain termination due to a lack of the 3’ -hydroxyl group necessary for DNA elongation.
Cellular DNA polymerase γ is also sensitive to inhibition by stavudine triphosphate, while cellular polymerases α and β are inhibited at concentrations 4,000-fold and 40-fold higher, respectively, than that needed to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase.
Stavudine treatment can select for and/ or maintain mutations associated with zidovudine resistance.
Isolates containing these mutations remain sensitive to stavudine.
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.
The activity of stavudine is affected by multi-drug resistance associated mutations such as Q151 M.
A more than 10-fold reduced sensitivity to stavudine has been reported for some strains with reduced sensitivity to zidovudine and lamivudine.
No mutations associated with high degree resistance specifically to stavudine have been revealed in vivo.
Clinical efficacy
Zerit has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents, e. g. didanosine, lamivudine, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, efavirenz, and nelfinavir.
Study AI455-099 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study with Zerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 391 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 272 cells/ mm3 (range 61 to 1,215 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.80 log10 copies/ ml (range 2.6 to 5.9 log 10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (70%) and non-white (58%) with a median age of 33 years (range 18 to 68 years).
Study AI455-096 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study with Zerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 76 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 261 cells/ mm3 (range 63 to 962 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.63 log10 copies/ ml (range 3.0 to 5.9 log10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (76%) and white (66%) with a median age of 34 years (range 22 to 67 years).

Only the data from the marketed formulation is presented.
In adolescents, children and infants, use of stavudine is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in paediatric patients (see also sections 4.8 and 5.2).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Adults
Absorption: the absolute bioavailability is 86±18%.
After multiple oral administration of 0.5-0.67 mg/ kg doses, a Cmax value of 810±175 ng/ ml was obtained.
Cmax and AUC increased proportionally with dose in the dose ranges, intravenous 0.0625-0.75 mg/ kg, and oral 0.033-4.0 mg/ kg.
In eight patients receiving 40 mg twice daily in the fasted state, steady-state AUC0-12h was 1284±227 ng⋅ h/ ml (18%) (mean ± SD [% CV]), Cmax was 536±146 ng/ ml (27%), and Cmin was 9±8 ng/ ml (89%).
A study in asymptomatic patients demonstrated that systemic exposure is similar while Cmax is lower and Tmax is prolonged when stavudine is administered with a standardised, high-fat meal compared with fasting conditions.
The clinical significance of this is unknown.
Distribution: the apparent volume of distribution at steady state is 46±21 l.
It was not possible to detect stavudine in cerebrospinal fluid until at least 2 hours after oral administration.
Four hours after administration, the CSF/ plasma ratio was 0.39±0.06.
No significant accumulation of stavudine is observed with repeated administration every 6, 8, or 12 hours.
Binding of stavudine to serum proteins was negligible over the concentration range of 0.01 to 11.4 µg/ ml.
Stavudine distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma.
Metabolism: the metabolism of stavudine has not been elucidated in humans.
Studies in monkeys indicate that approximately 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine, most of the remainder is hydrolysed to thymine and sugar.
Elimination: the terminal elimination half-life is 1.3±0.2 hours after a single dose, and 1.4±0.2 hours after multiple doses, and is independent of dose.
In vitro, stavudine triphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 3.5 hours in CEM T-cells (a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, supporting twice daily dosing.
Total clearance of stavudine is 594±164 ml/ min, and renal clearance is 237±98 ml/ min, indicating active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration.
After intravenous administration, 42±7% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.
The corresponding values after oral single and multiple dose administration are 34±5% and 40±12%, respectively.
The remaining 60% of the drug is presumably eliminated by endogenous pathways.
The half-life of stavudine is approximately 2 hours.
The pharmacokinetics of stavudine was independent of time, since the ratio between AUC(ss) at steady state and the AUC(0-t) after the first dose was approximately 1.
Intra- and interindividual variation in
10 pharmacokinetic characteristics of stavudine is low, approximately 15% and 25%, respectively, after oral administration.
Special Populations
Adolescents, children and infants: total exposure to stavudine was comparable between adolescents, children and infants ≥ 14 days receiving the 2 mg/ kg/ day dose and adults receiving 1 mg/ kg/ day.
Apparent oral clearance was approximately 14 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 5 weeks to 15 years, 12 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 14 to 28 days, and 5 ml/ min/ kg for infants on the day of birth.
Two to three hours post-dose, CSF/ plasma ratios of stavudine ranged from 16% to 125% (mean of 59%±35%).
Renal impairment: the clearance of stavudine decreases as creatinine clearance decreases; therefore, it is recommended that the dosage of Zerit be adjusted in patients with reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment: stavudine pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal data showed embryo-foetal toxicity at very high exposure levels.
An ex vivo study using a term human placenta model demonstrated that stavudine reaches the foetal circulation by simple diffusion.
A rat study also showed placental transfer of stavudine, with the foetal tissue concentration approximately 50% of the maternal plasma concentration.
Stavudine was genotoxic in in vitro tests in human lymphocytes possessing triphosphorylating activity (in which no no-effect level was established), in mouse fibroblasts, and in an in vivo test for chromosomal aberrations.
Similar effects have been observed with other nucleoside analogues.
Stavudine was carcinogenic in mice (liver tumours) and rats (liver tumours: cholangiocellular, hepatocellular, mixed hepatocholangiocellular, and/ or vascular; and urinary bladder carcinomas) at very high exposure levels.
No carcinogenicity was noted at doses of 400 mg/ kg/ day in mice and 600 mg/ kg/ day in rats, corresponding to exposures ~ 39 and 168 times the expected human exposure, respectively, suggesting an insignificant carcinogenic potential of stavudine in clinical therapy.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Zerit 20 mg hard capsule
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each hard capsule contains 20 mg of stavudine.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Hard capsule.
The hard capsule is brown, opaque and imprinted with “ BMS” over a BMS code “ 1965” on one side and “ 20” on the other side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Zerit is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infected patients.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
The therapy should be initiated by a doctor experienced in the management of HIV infection (see also section 4.4).
Adults: the recommended dosage is:
Patient weight < 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
Zerit dosage 30 mg twice daily (every 12 hours) 40 mg twice daily
Adolescents, children and infants over the age of 3 months: the recommended dosage is:
Patient weight < 30 kg ≥ 30 kg
Zerit dosage 1 mg/ kg twice daily (every 12 hours) adult dosing
For optimal absorption, Zerit should be taken on an empty stomach (i. e. at least 1 hour prior to meals) but, if this is not possible, it may be taken with a light meal.
Zerit may also be administered by carefully opening the hard capsule and mixing the contents with food.
Infants under the age of 3 months: please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the powder formulation.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Dose adjustments
Peripheral neuropathy: if symptoms of peripheral neuropathy develop (usually characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands) (see section 4.4) patients should be switched to an alternative treatment regimen, if appropriate.
In the rare cases when this is
13 inappropriate, dose reduction of stavudine may be considered, while the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are under close monitoring and satisfactory virological suppression is maintained.
The possible benefits of a dose reduction should be balanced in each case against the risks - which may result from this measure (lower intracellular concentrations).
Hepatic impairment: no initial dosage adjustment is necessary.
Renal impairment: the following dosages are recommended:
Zerit dosage (according to creatinine clearance)
Patient weight
26-50 ml/ min
≤ 25 ml/ min (including dialysis dependence*)
< 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
15 mg twice daily 20 mg twice daily
15 mg every 24 hours 20 mg every 24 hours
* Patients on haemodialysis should take Zerit after the completion of haemodialysis, and at the same time on non-dialysis days.
Since urinary excretion is also a major route of elimination of stavudine in paediatric patients, the clearance of stavudine may be altered in paediatric patients with renal impairment.
Although there are insufficient data to recommend a specific dosage adjustment of Zerit in this patient population, a reduction in the dose and/ or an increase in the interval between doses proportional to the reduction for adults should be considered.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to stavudine or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Peripheral neuropathy: patients with a history of peripheral neuropathy are at increased risk for development of neuropathy.
If Zerit must be administered in this setting, careful clinical monitoring is essential.
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands.
Pancreatitis: patients with a history of pancreatitis had an incidence of approximately 5% on Zerit, as compared to approximately 2% in patients without such a history.
Patients with a high risk of pancreatitis or those receiving products known to be associated with pancreatitis should be closely followed for symptoms of this condition.
Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis has been reported with the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactatemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/ or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness).
Lactic acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure, renal failure, or motor paralysis.
Lactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment.
Treatment with NRTIs should be discontinued if there is symptomatic hyperlactatemia and metabolic/ lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels.
Caution should be exercised when administering NRTIs to any patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk.
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely (see also section 4.6).
Liver disease: hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported.
The safety and efficacy of stavudine has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver
14 disorders.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events.
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice.
If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.
In the event of rapidly elevating transaminase levels (ALT/ AST, > 5 times upper limit of normal, ULN), discontinuation of Zerit and any potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products should be considered.
Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.
Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/ or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients.
The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.
Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete.
A connection between visceral lipomatosis and Protease Inhibitors and lipoatrophy and NRTIs has been hypothesised.
A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.
Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat redistribution.
Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood glucose.
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8).
There is evidence that mitochondrial DNA toxicity may be associated with specific features of lipoatrophy in patients using stavudine.
This should be taken into account when considering initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy with stavudine.
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Infants under the age of 3 months: safety data is available from clinical trials up to 6 weeks of treatment in 179 newborns and infants < 3 months of age (see section 4.8).
Special consideration should be given to the antiretroviral treatment history and the resistance profile of the HIV strain of the mother.
Mitochondrial dysfunction: nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage.
There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/ or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.8).
The main adverse events reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).
These events are often transitory.
Some late-onset neurological disorders have been reported (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).
Whether the neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.
Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, even HIV-negative children, should
15 have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms.
These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.
Not recommended combinations: pancreatitis (fatal and nonfatal) and peripheral neuropathy (severe in some cases) have been reported in HIV infected patients receiving stavudine in association with hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients treated with antiretroviral agents and hydroxyurea; fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with stavudine, hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hence, hydroxyurea should not be used in the treatment of HIV infection.
Lactose intolerance: the hard capsule contains lactose (180 mg).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults
Since stavudine is actively secreted by the renal tubules, interactions with other actively secreted medicinal products are possible, e. g. with trimethoprim.
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction has, however, been seen with lamivudine.
Zidovudine and stavudine are phosphorylated by the cellular enzyme (thymidine kinase), which preferentially phosphorylates zidovudine, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of stavudine to its active triphosphate form.
Zidovudine is therefore not recommended to be used in combination with stavudine.
In vitro studies indicate that the activation of stavudine is inhibited by doxorubicin and ribavirin but not by other medicinal products used in HIV infection which are similarly phosphorylated, (e. g. didanosine, zalcitabine, ganciclovir and foscarnet) therefore, coadministration of stavudine with either doxorubicin or ribavirin should be undertaken with caution.
Stavudine’ s influence on the phosphorylation kinetics of nucleoside analogues other than zidovudine has not been investigated.
Clinically significant interactions of stavudine or stavudine plus didanosine with nelfinavir have not been observed.
Stavudine does not inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4; therefore, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur with drugs metabolised through these pathways.
Because stavudine is not protein-bound, it is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of protein-bound drugs.
There have been no formal interaction studies with other medicinal products.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Zerit should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Clinical experience in pregnant women is limited, but congenital anomalies and abortions have been reported.
In study AI455-094, performed in South-Africa, 362 mother-infant pairs were included in a prevention of mother-to-child-transmission study.
Treatment naive pregnant women were enrolled into the study at gestation week 34-36 and given antiretroviral treatment until delivery.
Antiretroviral prophylaxis,
16 the same medications as given to the mother, was given to the new-born infant within 36 hours of delivery and continued for 6 weeks.
In the stavudine containing arms, the neonates were treated for 6 weeks with stavudine 1 mg/ kg BID.
The follow-up time was up to 24 weeks of age.
The mother-infant pairs were randomised to receive either stavudine (N= 91), didanosine (N= 94), stavudine + didanosine (N= 88) or zidovudine (N= 89).
95% Confidence intervals for the mother-to-child-transmission rates were 5.4-19.3% (stavudine), 5.2-18.7% (didanosine); 1.3-11.2% (stavudine + didanosine); and 1.9-12.6% for zidovudine.
Preliminary safety data from this study (see also section 4.8), showed an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected in this study.
However, lactic acidosis (see section 4.4), sometimes fatal, has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with or without other anti-retroviral treatment.
Embryo-foetal toxicities were seen only at high exposure levels in animals.
Preclinical studies showed placental transfer of stavudine (see section 5.3).
Until additional data become available, Zerit should be given during pregnancy only after special consideration; there is insufficient information to recommend Zerit for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Furthermore, the combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk.
It is recommended that HIV infected women should not breast-feed under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.
The data available on stavudine excretion into human breast milk are insufficient to assess the risk to the infant.
Studies in lactating rats showed that stavudine is excreted in breast milk.
Therefore, mothers should be instructed to discontinue breast-feeding prior to receiving Zerit.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Based on the pharmacodynamic properties of stavudine it is unlikely that Zerit affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults: extensive safety experience is available for Zerit used as monotherapy and in combination regimens.
Many of the serious undesirable effects with stavudine were consistent with the course of HIV infection or with the side effects of concomitant therapies.
Peripheral neuropathy:
In combination studies of Zerit with lamivudine plus efavirenz, the frequency of peripheral neurologic symptoms was 19% (6% for moderate to severe) with a rate of discontinuation due to neuropathy of 2%.
Dose-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in monotherapy trials with Zerit (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
The patients usually experienced resolution of symptoms after dose reduction or interruption.
Pancreatitis: pancreatitis, occasionally fatal, has been reported in up to 2-3% of patients enrolled in monotherapy clinical studies (see section 4.4).
Pancreatitis was reported in < 1% of patients in combination therapy studies with Zerit.
Lactic acidosis: cases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
Hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported with the use of stavudine and with other nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
17 Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise (see section 4.4).
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia (see section 4.4).
Osteonecrosis: cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Undesirable effects (moderate to severe) were reported from 467 patients treated with Zerit in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in two randomised clinical trials and an ongoing long-term follow-up study (total follow-up: median 56 weeks ranging up to 119 weeks).
The following undesirable effects considered possibly related to study regimen based on investigators’ attribution, have been identified:
Endocrine disorders:
uncommon: gynaecomastia
Gastrointestinal disorders:
common: diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia uncommon: pancreatitis, vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions:
common: fatigue uncommon: asthenia
Hepatobiliary disorders:
uncommon: hepatitis or jaundice
Metabolism and nutrition disorders:
common: lipoatrophy, * lipodystrophy uncommon: lactic acidosis (in some cases involving motor weakness), anorexia
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
uncommon: arthralgia, myalgia
Nervous system disorders:
common: peripheral neurologic symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, and peripheral neuritis; dizziness; abnormal dreams; headache, insomnia; abnormal thinking; somnolence
Psychiatric disorders:
common: depression uncommon: anxiety, emotional lability
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
common: rash, pruritus uncommon: urticaria
18 *Lipoatrophy was observed in a long-term follow-up study of stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz (total follow-up: median 148 weeks ranging up to 207 weeks).
Discontinuation due to undesirable events was 7% for the patients treated with Zerit.
Laboratory abnormalities reported in these two trials and an ongoing follow-up study included elevations of ALT (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of AST (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of lipase (≥ 2.1 ULN) in 3% of the patients in the Zerit group.
Neutropenia (< 750 cells/ mm3) was reported in 5%, thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/ mm3) in 2%, and low haemoglobin (< 8 g/ dl) in < 1% of patients receiving Zerit.
Macrocytosis was not evaluated in these trials, but was found to be associated with Zerit in an earlier trial (MCV > 112 fl occurred in 30% of patients treated with Zerit).
Adolescents, children and infants: undesirable effects and serious laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in paediatric patients ranging in age from birth through adolescence who received stavudine in clinical studies were generally similar in type and frequency to those seen in adults.
However, clinically significant peripheral neuropathy is less frequent.
These studies include ACTG 240, where 105 paediatric patients ages 3 months to 6 years received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day for a median of 6.4 months; a controlled clinical trial where 185 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day either alone or in combination with didanosine from birth through 6 weeks of age; and a clinical trial where 8 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day in combination with didanosine and nelfinavir from birth through 4 weeks of age.
In study AI455-094 (see also section 4.6), the safety follow-up period was restricted to only six months, which may be insufficient to capture long-term data on neurological adverse events and mitochondrial toxicity.
Relevant grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities in the 91 stavudine treated infants were low neutrophils in 7%, low hemoglobin in 1%, ALT increase in 1% and no lipase abnormality.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected.
No notable differences in the frequency of adverse drug reactions were seen between treatment groups.
There was, however, an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Postmarketing
The following events have been reported spontaneously during postmarketing experience:
Blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Not known: thrombocytopenia
Metabolic and nutrition disorders:
Common: asymptomatic hyperlactatemia, Not known: lactic acidosis
Hepatobiliary disorders:
Not known: liver failure, hepatitis and hepatic steatosis
Nervous system disorders:
Not known: motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome)
Mitochondrial dysfunction: review of the postmarketing safety database shows that adverse events indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction have been reported in the neonate and infant population exposed to one or more nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.4).
The HIV status for the newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age was negative, for older infants it tended to be positive.
The profile of the adverse events for newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age showed increases in lactic acid levels, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic transaminase increases and increased lipids, including hypertriglyceridaemia.
The number of reports in older infants was too small to identify a pattern.
19 4.9 Overdose
Experience in adults treated with up to 12 times the recommended daily dosage revealed no acute toxicity.
Complications of chronic overdosage could include peripheral neuropathy and hepatic dysfunction.
The mean haemodialysis clearance of stavudine is 120 ml/ min.
The contribution of this to the total elimination in an overdose situation is unknown.
It is not known whether stavudine is removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ATC code:
J05AF04
Stavudine, a thymidine analogue, is an antiviral agent with in vitro activity against HIV in human cells.
It is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to stavudine triphosphate which inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine triphosphate.
It also inhibits viral DNA synthesis by causing DNA chain termination due to a lack of the 3’ -hydroxyl group necessary for DNA elongation.
Cellular DNA polymerase γ is also sensitive to inhibition by stavudine triphosphate, while cellular polymerases α and β are inhibited at concentrations 4,000-fold and 40-fold higher, respectively, than that needed to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase.
Stavudine treatment can select for and/ or maintain mutations associated with zidovudine resistance.
Isolates containing these mutations remain sensitive to stavudine.
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.
The activity of stavudine is affected by multi-drug resistance associated mutations such as Q151 M.
A more than 10-fold reduced sensitivity to stavudine has been reported for some strains with reduced sensitivity to zidovudine and lamivudine.
No mutations associated with high degree resistance specifically to stavudine have been revealed in vivo.
Clinical efficacy
Zerit has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents, e. g. didanosine, lamivudine, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, efavirenz, and nelfinavir.
Study AI455-099 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study with Zerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 391 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 272 cells/ mm3 (range 61 to 1,215 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.80 log10 copies/ ml (range 2.6 to 5.9 log 10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (70%) and non-white (58%) with a median age of 33 years (range 18 to 68 years).
Study AI455-096 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study with Zerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 76 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 261 cells/ mm3 (range 63 to 962 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.63 log10 copies/ ml (range 3.0 to 5.9 log10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (76%) and white (66%) with a median age of 34 years (range 22 to 67 years).

Percent of patients who have HIV RNA < 400 c/ ml or < 50 c/ ml and do not meet any criteria for treatment failure including the occurrence of a new AIDS-defining diagnosis. b These studies were designed to compare two formulations of Zerit.
Only the data from the marketed formulation is presented.
In adolescents, children and infants, use of stavudine is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in paediatric patients (see also sections 4.8 and 5.2).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Adults
Absorption: the absolute bioavailability is 86±18%.
After multiple oral administration of 0.5-0.67 mg/ kg doses, a Cmax value of 810±175 ng/ ml was obtained.
Cmax and AUC increased proportionally with dose in the dose ranges, intravenous 0.0625-0.75 mg/ kg, and oral 0.033-4.0 mg/ kg.
In eight patients receiving 40 mg twice daily in the fasted state, steady-state AUC0-12h was 1284±227 ng⋅ h/ ml (18%) (mean ± SD [% CV]), Cmax was 536±146 ng/ ml (27%), and Cmin was 9±8 ng/ ml (89%).
A study in asymptomatic patients demonstrated that systemic exposure is similar while Cmax is lower and Tmax is prolonged when stavudine is administered with a standardised, high-fat meal compared with fasting conditions.
The clinical significance of this is unknown.
Distribution: the apparent volume of distribution at steady state is 46±21 l.
It was not possible to detect stavudine in cerebrospinal fluid until at least 2 hours after oral administration.
Four hours after administration, the CSF/ plasma ratio was 0.39±0.06.
No significant accumulation of stavudine is observed with repeated administration every 6, 8, or 12 hours.
Binding of stavudine to serum proteins was negligible over the concentration range of 0.01 to 11.4 µg/ ml.
Stavudine distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma.
Metabolism: the metabolism of stavudine has not been elucidated in humans.
Studies in monkeys indicate that approximately 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine, most of the remainder is hydrolysed to thymine and sugar.
Elimination: the terminal elimination half-life is 1.3±0.2 hours after a single dose, and 1.4±0.2 hours after multiple doses, and is independent of dose.
In vitro, stavudine triphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 3.5 hours in CEM T-cells (a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, supporting twice daily dosing.
Total clearance of stavudine is 594±164 ml/ min, and renal clearance is 237±98 ml/ min, indicating active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration.
After intravenous administration, 42±7% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.
The corresponding values after oral single and multiple dose administration are 34±5% and 40±12%, respectively.
The remaining 60% of the drug is presumably eliminated by endogenous pathways.
The half-life of stavudine is approximately 2 hours.
The pharmacokinetics of stavudine was independent of time, since the ratio between AUC(ss) at steady state and the AUC(0-t) after the first dose was approximately 1.
Intra- and interindividual variation in
21 pharmacokinetic characteristics of stavudine is low, approximately 15% and 25%, respectively, after oral administration.
Special Populations
Adolescents, children and infants: total exposure to stavudine was comparable between adolescents, children and infants ≥ 14 days receiving the 2 mg/ kg/ day dose and adults receiving 1 mg/ kg/ day.
Apparent oral clearance was approximately 14 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 5 weeks to 15 years, 12 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 14 to 28 days, and 5 ml/ min/ kg for infants on the day of birth.
Two to three hours post-dose, CSF/ plasma ratios of stavudine ranged from 16% to 125% (mean of 59%±35%).
Renal impairment: the clearance of stavudine decreases as creatinine clearance decreases; therefore, it is recommended that the dosage of Zerit be adjusted in patients with reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment: stavudine pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal data showed embryo-foetal toxicity at very high exposure levels.
An ex vivo study using a term human placenta model demonstrated that stavudine reaches the foetal circulation by simple diffusion.
A rat study also showed placental transfer of stavudine, with the foetal tissue concentration approximately 50% of the maternal plasma concentration.
Stavudine was genotoxic in in vitro tests in human lymphocytes possessing triphosphorylating activity (in which no no-effect level was established), in mouse fibroblasts, and in an in vivo test for chromosomal aberrations.
Similar effects have been observed with other nucleoside analogues.
Stavudine was carcinogenic in mice (liver tumours) and rats (liver tumours: cholangiocellular, hepatocellular, mixed hepatocholangiocellular, and/ or vascular; and urinary bladder carcinomas) at very high exposure levels.
No carcinogenicity was noted at doses of 400 mg/ kg/ day in mice and 600 mg/ kg/ day in rats, corresponding to exposures ~ 39 and 168 times the expected human exposure, respectively, suggesting an insignificant carcinogenic potential of stavudine in clinical therapy.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Zerit 30 mg hard capsule
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each hard capsule contains 30 mg of stavudine.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Hard capsule.
The hard capsule is light and dark orange, opaque and imprinted with “ BMS” over a BMS code “ 1966” on one side and “ 30” on the other side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Zerit is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infected patients.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
The therapy should be initiated by a doctor experienced in the management of HIV infection (see also section 4.4).
Adults: the recommended dosage is:
Patient weight < 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
Zerit dosage 30 mg twice daily (every 12 hours) 40 mg twice daily
Adolescents, children and infants over the age of 3 months: the recommended dosage is:
Patient weight < 30 kg ≥ 30 kg
Zerit dosage 1 mg/ kg twice daily (every 12 hours) adult dosing
For optimal absorption, Zerit should be taken on an empty stomach (i. e. at least 1 hour prior to meals) but, if this is not possible, it may be taken with a light meal.
Zerit may also be administered by carefully opening the hard capsule and mixing the contents with food.
Infants under the age of 3 months: please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the powder formulation.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Dose adjustments
Peripheral neuropathy: if symptoms of peripheral neuropathy develop (usually characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands) (see section 4.4) patients should be switched to an alternative treatment regimen, if appropriate.
In the rare cases when this is
24 inappropriate, dose reduction of stavudine may be considered, while the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are under close monitoring and satisfactory virological suppression is maintained.
The possible benefits of a dose reduction should be balanced in each case against the risks - which may result from this measure (lower intracellular concentrations).
Hepatic impairment: no initial dosage adjustment is necessary.
Renal impairment: the following dosages are recommended:
Zerit dosage (according to creatinine clearance)
Patient weight
26-50 ml/ min
≤ 25 ml/ min (including dialysis dependence*)
< 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
15 mg twice daily 20 mg twice daily
15 mg every 24 hours 20 mg every 24 hours
* Patients on haemodialysis should take Zerit after the completion of haemodialysis, and at the same time on non-dialysis days.
Since urinary excretion is also a major route of elimination of stavudine in paediatric patients, the clearance of stavudine may be altered in paediatric patients with renal impairment.
Although there are insufficient data to recommend a specific dosage adjustment of Zerit in this patient population, a reduction in the dose and/ or an increase in the interval between doses proportional to the reduction for adults should be considered.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to stavudine or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Peripheral neuropathy: patients with a history of peripheral neuropathy are at increased risk for development of neuropathy.
If Zerit must be administered in this setting, careful clinical monitoring is essential.
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands.
Pancreatitis: patients with a history of pancreatitis had an incidence of approximately 5% on Zerit, as compared to approximately 2% in patients without such a history.
Patients with a high risk of pancreatitis or those receiving products known to be associated with pancreatitis should be closely followed for symptoms of this condition.
Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis has been reported with the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactatemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/ or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness).
Lactic acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure, renal failure, or motor paralysis.
Lactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment.
Treatment with NRTIs should be discontinued if there is symptomatic hyperlactatemia and metabolic/ lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels.
Caution should be exercised when administering NRTIs to any patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk.
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely (see also section 4.6).
Liver disease: hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported.
The safety and efficacy of stavudine has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver
25 disorders.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events.
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice.
If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.
In the event of rapidly elevating transaminase levels (ALT/ AST, > 5 times upper limit of normal, ULN), discontinuation of Zerit and any potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products should be considered.
Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.
Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/ or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients.
The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.
Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete.
A connection between visceral lipomatosis and Protease Inhibitors and lipoatrophy and NRTIs has been hypothesised.
A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.
Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat redistribution.
Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood glucose.
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8).
There is evidence that mitochondrial DNA toxicity may be associated with specific features of lipoatrophy in patients using stavudine.
This should be taken into account when considering initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy with stavudine.
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Infants under the age of 3 months: safety data is available from clinical trials up to 6 weeks of treatment in 179 newborns and infants < 3 months of age (see section 4.8).
Special consideration should be given to the antiretroviral treatment history and the resistance profile of the HIV strain of the mother.
Mitochondrial dysfunction: nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage.
There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/ or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.8).
The main adverse events reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).
These events are often transitory.
Some late-onset neurological disorders have been reported (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).
Whether the neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.
Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, even HIV-negative children, should
26 have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms.
These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.
Not recommended combinations: pancreatitis (fatal and nonfatal) and peripheral neuropathy (severe in some cases) have been reported in HIV infected patients receiving stavudine in association with hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients treated with antiretroviral agents and hydroxyurea; fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with stavudine, hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hence, hydroxyurea should not be used in the treatment of HIV infection.
Lactose intolerance: the hard capsule contains lactose (180 mg).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults
Since stavudine is actively secreted by the renal tubules, interactions with other actively secreted medicinal products are possible, e. g. with trimethoprim.
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction has, however, been seen with lamivudine.
Zidovudine and stavudine are phosphorylated by the cellular enzyme (thymidine kinase), which preferentially phosphorylates zidovudine, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of stavudine to its active triphosphate form.
Zidovudine is therefore not recommended to be used in combination with stavudine.
In vitro studies indicate that the activation of stavudine is inhibited by doxorubicin and ribavirin but not by other medicinal products used in HIV infection which are similarly phosphorylated, (e. g. didanosine, zalcitabine, ganciclovir and foscarnet) therefore, coadministration of stavudine with either doxorubicin or ribavirin should be undertaken with caution.
Stavudine’ s influence on the phosphorylation kinetics of nucleoside analogues other than zidovudine has not been investigated.
Clinically significant interactions of stavudine or stavudine plus didanosine with nelfinavir have not been observed.
Stavudine does not inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4; therefore, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur with drugs metabolised through these pathways.
Because stavudine is not protein-bound, it is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of protein-bound drugs.
There have been no formal interaction studies with other medicinal products.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Zerit should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Clinical experience in pregnant women is limited, but congenital anomalies and abortions have been reported.
In study AI455-094, performed in South-Africa, 362 mother-infant pairs were included in a prevention of mother-to-child-transmission study.
Treatment naive pregnant women were enrolled into the study at gestation week 34-36 and given antiretroviral treatment until delivery.
Antiretroviral prophylaxis,
27 the same medications as given to the mother, was given to the new-born infant within 36 hours of delivery and continued for 6 weeks.
In the stavudine containing arms, the neonates were treated for 6 weeks with stavudine 1 mg/ kg BID.
The follow-up time was up to 24 weeks of age.
The mother-infant pairs were randomised to receive either stavudine (N= 91), didanosine (N= 94), stavudine + didanosine (N= 88) or zidovudine (N= 89).
95% Confidence intervals for the mother-to-child-transmission rates were 5.4-19.3% (stavudine), 5.2-18.7% (didanosine); 1.3-11.2% (stavudine + didanosine); and 1.9-12.6% for zidovudine.
Preliminary safety data from this study (see also section 4.8), showed an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected in this study.
However, lactic acidosis (see section 4.4), sometimes fatal, has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with or without other anti-retroviral treatment.
Embryo-foetal toxicities were seen only at high exposure levels in animals.
Preclinical studies showed placental transfer of stavudine (see section 5.3).
Until additional data become available, Zerit should be given during pregnancy only after special consideration; there is insufficient information to recommend Zerit for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Furthermore, the combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk.
It is recommended that HIV infected women should not breast-feed under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.
The data available on stavudine excretion into human breast milk are insufficient to assess the risk to the infant.
Studies in lactating rats showed that stavudine is excreted in breast milk.
Therefore, mothers should be instructed to discontinue breast-feeding prior to receiving Zerit.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Based on the pharmacodynamic properties of stavudine it is unlikely that Zerit affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults: extensive safety experience is available for Zerit used as monotherapy and in combination regimens.
Many of the serious undesirable effects with stavudine were consistent with the course of HIV infection or with the side effects of concomitant therapies.
Peripheral neuropathy:
In combination studies of Zerit with lamivudine plus efavirenz, the frequency of peripheral neurologic symptoms was 19% (6% for moderate to severe) with a rate of discontinuation due to neuropathy of 2%.
Dose-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in monotherapy trials with Zerit (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
The patients usually experienced resolution of symptoms after dose reduction or interruption.
Pancreatitis: pancreatitis, occasionally fatal, has been reported in up to 2-3% of patients enrolled in monotherapy clinical studies (see section 4.4).
Pancreatitis was reported in < 1% of patients in combination therapy studies with Zerit.
Lactic acidosis: cases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
Hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported with the use of stavudine and with other nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
28 Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise (see section 4.4).
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia (see section 4.4).
Osteonecrosis: cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Undesirable effects (moderate to severe) were reported from 467 patients treated with Zerit in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in two randomised clinical trials and an ongoing long-term follow-up study (total follow-up: median 56 weeks ranging up to 119 weeks).
The following undesirable effects considered possibly related to study regimen based on investigators’ attribution, have been identified:
Endocrine disorders:
uncommon: gynaecomastia
Gastrointestinal disorders:
common: diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia uncommon: pancreatitis, vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions:
common: fatigue uncommon: asthenia
Hepatobiliary disorders:
uncommon: hepatitis or jaundice
Metabolism and nutrition disorders:
common: lipoatrophy, * lipodystrophy uncommon: lactic acidosis (in some cases involving motor weakness), anorexia
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
uncommon: arthralgia, myalgia
Nervous system disorders:
common: peripheral neurologic symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, and peripheral neuritis; dizziness; abnormal dreams; headache, insomnia; abnormal thinking; somnolence
Psychiatric disorders:
common: depression uncommon: anxiety, emotional lability
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
common: rash, pruritus uncommon: urticaria
29 *Lipoatrophy was observed in a long-term follow-up study of stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz (total follow-up: median 148 weeks ranging up to 207 weeks).
Discontinuation due to undesirable events was 7% for the patients treated with Zerit.
Laboratory abnormalities reported in these two trials and an ongoing follow-up study included elevations of ALT (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of AST (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of lipase (≥ 2.1 ULN) in 3% of the patients in the Zerit group.
Neutropenia (< 750 cells/ mm3) was reported in 5%, thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/ mm3) in 2%, and low haemoglobin (< 8 g/ dl) in < 1% of patients receiving Zerit.
Macrocytosis was not evaluated in these trials, but was found to be associated with Zerit in an earlier trial (MCV > 112 fl occurred in 30% of patients treated with Zerit).
Adolescents, children and infants: undesirable effects and serious laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in paediatric patients ranging in age from birth through adolescence who received stavudine in clinical studies were generally similar in type and frequency to those seen in adults.
However, clinically significant peripheral neuropathy is less frequent.
These studies include ACTG 240, where 105 paediatric patients ages 3 months to 6 years received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day for a median of 6.4 months; a controlled clinical trial where 185 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day either alone or in combination with didanosine from birth through 6 weeks of age; and a clinical trial where 8 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day in combination with didanosine and nelfinavir from birth through 4 weeks of age.
In study AI455-094 (see also section 4.6), the safety follow-up period was restricted to only six months, which may be insufficient to capture long-term data on neurological adverse events and mitochondrial toxicity.
Relevant grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities in the 91 stavudine treated infants were low neutrophils in 7%, low hemoglobin in 1%, ALT increase in 1% and no lipase abnormality.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected.
No notable differences in the frequency of adverse drug reactions were seen between treatment groups.
There was, however, an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Postmarketing
The following events have been reported spontaneously during postmarketing experience:
Blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Not known: thrombocytopenia
Metabolic and nutrition disorders:
Common: asymptomatic hyperlactatemia, Not known: lactic acidosis
Hepatobiliary disorders:
Not known: liver failure, hepatitis and hepatic steatosis
Nervous system disorders:
Not known: motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome)
Mitochondrial dysfunction: review of the postmarketing safety database shows that adverse events indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction have been reported in the neonate and infant population exposed to one or more nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.4).
The HIV status for the newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age was negative, for older infants it tended to be positive.
The profile of the adverse events for newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age showed increases in lactic acid levels, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic transaminase increases and increased lipids, including hypertriglyceridaemia.
The number of reports in older infants was too small to identify a pattern.
30 4.9 Overdose
Experience in adults treated with up to 12 times the recommended daily dosage revealed no acute toxicity.
Complications of chronic overdosage could include peripheral neuropathy and hepatic dysfunction.
The mean haemodialysis clearance of stavudine is 120 ml/ min.
The contribution of this to the total elimination in an overdose situation is unknown.
It is not known whether stavudine is removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ATC code:
J05AF04
Stavudine, a thymidine analogue, is an antiviral agent with in vitro activity against HIV in human cells.
It is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to stavudine triphosphate which inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine triphosphate.
It also inhibits viral DNA synthesis by causing DNA chain termination due to a lack of the 3’ -hydroxyl group necessary for DNA elongation.
Cellular DNA polymerase γ is also sensitive to inhibition by stavudine triphosphate, while cellular polymerases α and β are inhibited at concentrations 4,000-fold and 40-fold higher, respectively, than that needed to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase.
Stavudine treatment can select for and/ or maintain mutations associated with zidovudine resistance.
Isolates containing these mutations remain sensitive to stavudine.
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.
The activity of stavudine is affected by multi-drug resistance associated mutations such as Q151 M.
A more than 10-fold reduced sensitivity to stavudine has been reported for some strains with reduced sensitivity to zidovudine and lamivudine.
No mutations associated with high degree resistance specifically to stavudine have been revealed in vivo.
Clinical efficacy
Zerit has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents, e. g. didanosine, lamivudine, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, efavirenz, and nelfinavir.
Study AI455-099 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study with Zerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 391 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 272 cells/ mm3 (range 61 to 1,215 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.80 log10 copies/ ml (range 2.6 to 5.9 log 10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (70%) and non-white (58%) with a median age of 33 years (range 18 to 68 years).
Study AI455-096 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study with Zerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 76 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 261 cells/ mm3 (range 63 to 962 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.63 log10 copies/ ml (range 3.0 to 5.9 log10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (76%) and white (66%) with a median age of 34 years (range 22 to 67 years).

Only the data from the marketed formulation is presented.
In adolescents, children and infants, use of stavudine is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in paediatric patients (see also sections 4.8 and 5.2).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Adults
Absorption: the absolute bioavailability is 86±18%.
After multiple oral administration of 0.5-0.67 mg/ kg doses, a Cmax value of 810±175 ng/ ml was obtained.
Cmax and AUC increased proportionally with dose in the dose ranges, intravenous 0.0625-0.75 mg/ kg, and oral 0.033-4.0 mg/ kg.
In eight patients receiving 40 mg twice daily in the fasted state, steady-state AUC0-12h was 1284±227 ng⋅ h/ ml (18%) (mean ± SD [% CV]), Cmax was 536±146 ng/ ml (27%), and Cmin was 9±8 ng/ ml (89%).
A study in asymptomatic patients demonstrated that systemic exposure is similar while Cmax is lower and Tmax is prolonged when stavudine is administered with a standardised, high-fat meal compared with fasting conditions.
The clinical significance of this is unknown.
Distribution: the apparent volume of distribution at steady state is 46±21 l.
It was not possible to detect stavudine in cerebrospinal fluid until at least 2 hours after oral administration.
Four hours after administration, the CSF/ plasma ratio was 0.39±0.06.
No significant accumulation of stavudine is observed with repeated administration every 6, 8, or 12 hours.
Binding of stavudine to serum proteins was negligible over the concentration range of 0.01 to 11.4 µg/ ml.
Stavudine distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma.
Metabolism: the metabolism of stavudine has not been elucidated in humans.
Studies in monkeys indicate that approximately 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine, most of the remainder is hydrolysed to thymine and sugar.
Elimination: the terminal elimination half-life is 1.3±0.2 hours after a single dose, and 1.4±0.2 hours after multiple doses, and is independent of dose.
In vitro, stavudine triphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 3.5 hours in CEM T-cells (a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, supporting twice daily dosing.
Total clearance of stavudine is 594±164 ml/ min, and renal clearance is 237±98 ml/ min, indicating active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration.
After intravenous administration, 42±7% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.
The corresponding values after oral single and multiple dose administration are 34±5% and 40±12%, respectively.
The remaining 60% of the drug is presumably eliminated by endogenous pathways.
The half-life of stavudine is approximately 2 hours.
The pharmacokinetics of stavudine was independent of time, since the ratio between AUC(ss) at steady state and the AUC(0-t) after the first dose was approximately 1.
Intra- and interindividual variation in
32 pharmacokinetic characteristics of stavudine is low, approximately 15% and 25%, respectively, after oral administration.
Special Populations
Adolescents, children and infants: total exposure to stavudine was comparable between adolescents, children and infants ≥ 14 days receiving the 2 mg/ kg/ day dose and adults receiving 1 mg/ kg/ day.
Apparent oral clearance was approximately 14 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 5 weeks to 15 years, 12 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 14 to 28 days, and 5 ml/ min/ kg for infants on the day of birth.
Two to three hours post-dose, CSF/ plasma ratios of stavudine ranged from 16% to 125% (mean of 59%±35%).
Renal impairment: the clearance of stavudine decreases as creatinine clearance decreases; therefore, it is recommended that the dosage of Zerit be adjusted in patients with reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment: stavudine pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal data showed embryo-foetal toxicity at very high exposure levels.
An ex vivo study using a term human placenta model demonstrated that stavudine reaches the foetal circulation by simple diffusion.
A rat study also showed placental transfer of stavudine, with the foetal tissue concentration approximately 50% of the maternal plasma concentration.
Stavudine was genotoxic in in vitro tests in human lymphocytes possessing triphosphorylating activity (in which no no-effect level was established), in mouse fibroblasts, and in an in vivo test for chromosomal aberrations.
Similar effects have been observed with other nucleoside analogues.
Stavudine was carcinogenic in mice (liver tumours) and rats (liver tumours: cholangiocellular, hepatocellular, mixed hepatocholangiocellular, and/ or vascular; and urinary bladder carcinomas) at very high exposure levels.
No carcinogenicity was noted at doses of 400 mg/ kg/ day in mice and 600 mg/ kg/ day in rats, corresponding to exposures ~ 39 and 168 times the expected human exposure, respectively, suggesting an insignificant carcinogenic potential of stavudine in clinical therapy.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Zerit 40 mg hard capsule
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each hard capsule contains 40 mg of stavudine.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Hard capsule.
The hard capsule is dark orange, opaque and imprinted with “ BMS” over a BMS code “ 1967” on one side and “ 40” on the other side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Zerit is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infected patients.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
The therapy should be initiated by a doctor experienced in the management of HIV infection (see also section 4.4).
Adults: the recommended dosage is:
Patient weight < 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
Zerit dosage 30 mg twice daily (every 12 hours) 40 mg twice daily
Adolescents, children and infants over the age of 3 months: the recommended dosage is:
Patient weight < 30 kg ≥ 30 kg
Zerit dosage 1 mg/ kg twice daily (every 12 hours) adult dosing
For optimal absorption, Zerit should be taken on an empty stomach (i. e. at least 1 hour prior to meals) but, if this is not possible, it may be taken with a light meal.
Zerit may also be administered by carefully opening the hard capsule and mixing the contents with food.
Infants under the age of 3 months: please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the powder formulation.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Dose adjustments
Peripheral neuropathy: if symptoms of peripheral neuropathy develop (usually characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands) (see section 4.4) patients should be switched to an alternative treatment regimen, if appropriate.
In the rare cases when this is
35 inappropriate, dose reduction of stavudine may be considered, while the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are under close monitoring and satisfactory virological suppression is maintained.
The possible benefits of a dose reduction should be balanced in each case against the risks - which may result from this measure (lower intracellular concentrations).
Hepatic impairment: no initial dosage adjustment is necessary.
Renal impairment: the following dosages are recommended:
Zerit dosage (according to creatinine clearance)
Patient weight
26-50 ml/ min
≤ 25 ml/ min (including dialysis dependence*)
< 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
15 mg twice daily 20 mg twice daily
15 mg every 24 hours 20 mg every 24 hours
* Patients on haemodialysis should take Zerit after the completion of haemodialysis, and at the same time on non-dialysis days.
Since urinary excretion is also a major route of elimination of stavudine in paediatric patients, the clearance of stavudine may be altered in paediatric patients with renal impairment.
Although there are insufficient data to recommend a specific dosage adjustment of Zerit in this patient population, a reduction in the dose and/ or an increase in the interval between doses proportional to the reduction for adults should be considered.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to stavudine or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Peripheral neuropathy: patients with a history of peripheral neuropathy are at increased risk for development of neuropathy.
If Zerit must be administered in this setting, careful clinical monitoring is essential.
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands.
Pancreatitis: patients with a history of pancreatitis had an incidence of approximately 5% on Zerit, as compared to approximately 2% in patients without such a history.
Patients with a high risk of pancreatitis or those receiving products known to be associated with pancreatitis should be closely followed for symptoms of this condition.
Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis has been reported with the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactatemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/ or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness).
Lactic acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure, renal failure, or motor paralysis.
Lactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment.
Treatment with NRTIs should be discontinued if there is symptomatic hyperlactatemia and metabolic/ lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels.
Caution should be exercised when administering NRTIs to any patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk.
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely (see also section 4.6).
Liver disease: hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported.
The safety and efficacy of stavudine has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver
36 disorders.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events.
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice.
If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.
In the event of rapidly elevating transaminase levels (ALT/ AST, > 5 times upper limit of normal, ULN), discontinuation of Zerit and any potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products should be considered.
Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.
Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/ or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients.
The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.
Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete.
A connection between visceral lipomatosis and Protease Inhibitors and lipoatrophy and NRTIs has been hypothesised.
A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.
Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat redistribution.
Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood glucose.
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8).
There is evidence that mitochondrial DNA toxicity may be associated with specific features of lipoatrophy in patients using stavudine.
This should be taken into account when considering initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy with stavudine.
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Infants under the age of 3 months: safety data is available from clinical trials up to 6 weeks of treatment in 179 newborns and infants < 3 months of age (see section 4.8).
Special consideration should be given to the antiretroviral treatment history and the resistance profile of the HIV strain of the mother.
Mitochondrial dysfunction: nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage.
There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/ or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.8).
The main adverse events reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).
These events are often transitory.
Some late-onset neurological disorders have been reported (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).
Whether the neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.
Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, even HIV-negative children, should
37 have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms.
These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.
Not recommended combinations: pancreatitis (fatal and nonfatal) and peripheral neuropathy (severe in some cases) have been reported in HIV infected patients receiving stavudine in association with hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients treated with antiretroviral agents and hydroxyurea; fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with stavudine, hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hence, hydroxyurea should not be used in the treatment of HIV infection.
Lactose intolerance: the hard capsule contains lactose (240 mg).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults
Since stavudine is actively secreted by the renal tubules, interactions with other actively secreted medicinal products are possible, e. g. with trimethoprim.
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction has, however, been seen with lamivudine.
Zidovudine and stavudine are phosphorylated by the cellular enzyme (thymidine kinase), which preferentially phosphorylates zidovudine, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of stavudine to its active triphosphate form.
Zidovudine is therefore not recommended to be used in combination with stavudine.
In vitro studies indicate that the activation of stavudine is inhibited by doxorubicin and ribavirin but not by other medicinal products used in HIV infection which are similarly phosphorylated, (e. g. didanosine, zalcitabine, ganciclovir and foscarnet) therefore, coadministration of stavudine with either doxorubicin or ribavirin should be undertaken with caution.
Stavudine’ s influence on the phosphorylation kinetics of nucleoside analogues other than zidovudine has not been investigated.
Clinically significant interactions of stavudine or stavudine plus didanosine with nelfinavir have not been observed.
Stavudine does not inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4; therefore, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur with drugs metabolised through these pathways.
Because stavudine is not protein-bound, it is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of protein-bound drugs.
There have been no formal interaction studies with other medicinal products.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Zerit should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Clinical experience in pregnant women is limited, but congenital anomalies and abortions have been reported.
In study AI455-094, performed in South-Africa, 362 mother-infant pairs were included in a prevention of mother-to-child-transmission study.
Treatment naive pregnant women were enrolled into the study at gestation week 34-36 and given antiretroviral treatment until delivery.
Antiretroviral prophylaxis,
38 the same medications as given to the mother, was given to the new-born infant within 36 hours of delivery and continued for 6 weeks.
In the stavudine containing arms, the neonates were treated for 6 weeks with stavudine 1 mg/ kg BID.
The follow-up time was up to 24 weeks of age.
The mother-infant pairs were randomised to receive either stavudine (N= 91), didanosine (N= 94), stavudine + didanosine (N= 88) or zidovudine (N= 89).
95% Confidence intervals for the mother-to-child-transmission rates were 5.4-19.3% (stavudine), 5.2-18.7% (didanosine); 1.3-11.2% (stavudine + didanosine); and 1.9-12.6% for zidovudine.
Preliminary safety data from this study (see also section 4.8), showed an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected in this study.
However, lactic acidosis (see section 4.4), sometimes fatal, has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with or without other anti-retroviral treatment.
Embryo-foetal toxicities were seen only at high exposure levels in animals.
Preclinical studies showed placental transfer of stavudine (see section 5.3).
Until additional data become available, Zerit should be given during pregnancy only after special consideration; there is insufficient information to recommend Zerit for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Furthermore, the combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk.
It is recommended that HIV infected women should not breast-feed under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.
The data available on stavudine excretion into human breast milk are insufficient to assess the risk to the infant.
Studies in lactating rats showed that stavudine is excreted in breast milk.
Therefore, mothers should be instructed to discontinue breast-feeding prior to receiving Zerit.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Based on the pharmacodynamic properties of stavudine it is unlikely that Zerit affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults: extensive safety experience is available for Zerit used as monotherapy and in combination regimens.
Many of the serious undesirable effects with stavudine were consistent with the course of HIV infection or with the side effects of concomitant therapies.
Peripheral neuropathy:
In combination studies of Zerit with lamivudine plus efavirenz, the frequency of peripheral neurologic symptoms was 19% (6% for moderate to severe) with a rate of discontinuation due to neuropathy of 2%.
Dose-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in monotherapy trials with Zerit (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
The patients usually experienced resolution of symptoms after dose reduction or interruption.
Pancreatitis: pancreatitis, occasionally fatal, has been reported in up to 2-3% of patients enrolled in monotherapy clinical studies (see section 4.4).
Pancreatitis was reported in < 1% of patients in combination therapy studies with Zerit.
Lactic acidosis: cases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
Hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported with the use of stavudine and with other nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
39 Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise (see section 4.4).
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia (see section 4.4).
Osteonecrosis: cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Undesirable effects (moderate to severe) were reported from 467 patients treated with Zerit in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in two randomised clinical trials and an ongoing long-term follow-up study (total follow-up: median 56 weeks ranging up to 119 weeks).
The following undesirable effects considered possibly related to study regimen based on investigators’ attribution, have been identified:
Endocrine disorders:
uncommon: gynaecomastia
Gastrointestinal disorders:
common: diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia uncommon: pancreatitis, vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions:
common: fatigue uncommon: asthenia
Hepatobiliary disorders:
uncommon: hepatitis or jaundice
Metabolism and nutrition disorders:
common: lipoatrophy, * lipodystrophy uncommon: lactic acidosis (in some cases involving motor weakness), anorexia
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
uncommon: arthralgia, myalgia
Nervous system disorders:
common: peripheral neurologic symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, and peripheral neuritis; dizziness; abnormal dreams; headache, insomnia; abnormal thinking; somnolence
Psychiatric disorders:
common: depression uncommon: anxiety, emotional lability
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
common: rash, pruritus uncommon: urticaria
40 *Lipoatrophy was observed in a long-term follow-up study of stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz (total follow-up: median 148 weeks ranging up to 207 weeks).
Discontinuation due to undesirable events was 7% for the patients treated with Zerit.
Laboratory abnormalities reported in these two trials and an ongoing follow-up study included elevations of ALT (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of AST (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of lipase (≥ 2.1 ULN) in 3% of the patients in the Zerit group.
Neutropenia (< 750 cells/ mm3) was reported in 5%, thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/ mm3) in 2%, and low haemoglobin (< 8 g/ dl) in < 1% of patients receiving Zerit.
Macrocytosis was not evaluated in these trials, but was found to be associated with Zerit in an earlier trial (MCV > 112 fl occurred in 30% of patients treated with Zerit).
Adolescents, children and infants: undesirable effects and serious laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in paediatric patients ranging in age from birth through adolescence who received stavudine in clinical studies were generally similar in type and frequency to those seen in adults.
However, clinically significant peripheral neuropathy is less frequent.
These studies include ACTG 240, where 105 paediatric patients ages 3 months to 6 years received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day for a median of 6.4 months; a controlled clinical trial where 185 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day either alone or in combination with didanosine from birth through 6 weeks of age; and a clinical trial where 8 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day in combination with didanosine and nelfinavir from birth through 4 weeks of age.
In study AI455-094 (see also section 4.6), the safety follow-up period was restricted to only six months, which may be insufficient to capture long-term data on neurological adverse events and mitochondrial toxicity.
Relevant grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities in the 91 stavudine treated infants were low neutrophils in 7%, low hemoglobin in 1%, ALT increase in 1% and no lipase abnormality.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected.
No notable differences in the frequency of adverse drug reactions were seen between treatment groups.
There was, however, an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Postmarketing
The following events have been reported spontaneously during postmarketing experience:
Blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Not known: thrombocytopenia
Metabolic and nutrition disorders:
Common: asymptomatic hyperlactatemia, Not known: lactic acidosis
Hepatobiliary disorders:
Not known: liver failure, hepatitis and hepatic steatosis
Nervous system disorders:
Not known: motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome)
Mitochondrial dysfunction: review of the postmarketing safety database shows that adverse events indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction have been reported in the neonate and infant population exposed to one or more nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.4).
The HIV status for the newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age was negative, for older infants it tended to be positive.
The profile of the adverse events for newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age showed increases in lactic acid levels, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic transaminase increases and increased lipids, including hypertriglyceridaemia.
The number of reports in older infants was too small to identify a pattern.
41 4.9 Overdose
Experience in adults treated with up to 12 times the recommended daily dosage revealed no acute toxicity.
Complications of chronic overdosage could include peripheral neuropathy and hepatic dysfunction.
The mean haemodialysis clearance of stavudine is 120 ml/ min.
The contribution of this to the total elimination in an overdose situation is unknown.
It is not known whether stavudine is removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ATC code:
J05AF04
Stavudine, a thymidine analogue, is an antiviral agent with in vitro activity against HIV in human cells.
It is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to stavudine triphosphate which inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine triphosphate.
It also inhibits viral DNA synthesis by causing DNA chain termination due to a lack of the 3’ -hydroxyl group necessary for DNA elongation.
Cellular DNA polymerase γ is also sensitive to inhibition by stavudine triphosphate, while cellular polymerases α and β are inhibited at concentrations 4,000-fold and 40-fold higher, respectively, than that needed to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase.
Stavudine treatment can select for and/ or maintain mutations associated with zidovudine resistance.
Isolates containing these mutations remain sensitive to stavudine.
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.
The activity of stavudine is affected by multi-drug resistance associated mutations such as Q151 M.
A more than 10-fold reduced sensitivity to stavudine has been reported for some strains with reduced sensitivity to zidovudine and lamivudine.
No mutations associated with high degree resistance specifically to stavudine have been revealed in vivo.
Clinical efficacy
Zerit has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents, e. g. didanosine, lamivudine, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, efavirenz, and nelfinavir.
Study AI455-099 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study with Zerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 391 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 272 cells/ mm3 (range 61 to 1,215 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.80 log10 copies/ ml (range 2.6 to 5.9 log 10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (70%) and non-white (58%) with a median age of 33 years (range 18 to 68 years).
Study AI455-096 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study with Zerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 76 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 261 cells/ mm3 (range 63 to 962 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.63 log10 copies/ ml (range 3.0 to 5.9 log10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (76%) and white (66%) with a median age of 34 years (range 22 to 67 years).

Only the data from the marketed formulation is presented.
In adolescents, children and infants, use of stavudine is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in paediatric patients (see also sections 4.8 and 5.2).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Adults
Absorption: the absolute bioavailability is 86±18%.
After multiple oral administration of 0.5-0.67 mg/ kg doses, a Cmax value of 810±175 ng/ ml was obtained.
Cmax and AUC increased proportionally with dose in the dose ranges, intravenous 0.0625-0.75 mg/ kg, and oral 0.033-4.0 mg/ kg.
In eight patients receiving 40 mg twice daily in the fasted state, steady-state AUC0-12h was 1284±227 ng⋅ h/ ml (18%) (mean ± SD [% CV]), Cmax was 536±146 ng/ ml (27%), and Cmin was 9±8 ng/ ml (89%).
A study in asymptomatic patients demonstrated that systemic exposure is similar while Cmax is lower and Tmax is prolonged when stavudine is administered with a standardised, high-fat meal compared with fasting conditions.
The clinical significance of this is unknown.
Distribution: the apparent volume of distribution at steady state is 46±21 l.
It was not possible to detect stavudine in cerebrospinal fluid until at least 2 hours after oral administration.
Four hours after administration, the CSF/ plasma ratio was 0.39±0.06.
No significant accumulation of stavudine is observed with repeated administration every 6, 8, or 12 hours.
Binding of stavudine to serum proteins was negligible over the concentration range of 0.01 to 11.4 µg/ ml.
Stavudine distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma.
Metabolism: the metabolism of stavudine has not been elucidated in humans.
Studies in monkeys indicate that approximately 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine, most of the remainder is hydrolysed to thymine and sugar.
Elimination: the terminal elimination half-life is 1.3±0.2 hours after a single dose, and 1.4±0.2 hours after multiple doses, and is independent of dose.
In vitro, stavudine triphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 3.5 hours in CEM T-cells (a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, supporting twice daily dosing.
Total clearance of stavudine is 594±164 ml/ min, and renal clearance is 237±98 ml/ min, indicating active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration.
After intravenous administration, 42±7% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.
The corresponding values after oral single and multiple dose administration are 34±5% and 40±12%, respectively.
The remaining 60% of the drug is presumably eliminated by endogenous pathways.
The half-life of stavudine is approximately 2 hours.
The pharmacokinetics of stavudine was independent of time, since the ratio between AUC(ss) at steady state and the AUC(0-t) after the first dose was approximately 1.
Intra- and interindividual variation in
43 pharmacokinetic characteristics of stavudine is low, approximately 15% and 25%, respectively, after oral administration.
Special Populations
Adolescents, children and infants: total exposure to stavudine was comparable between adolescents, children and infants ≥ 14 days receiving the 2 mg/ kg/ day dose and adults receiving 1 mg/ kg/ day.
Apparent oral clearance was approximately 14 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 5 weeks to 15 years, 12 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 14 to 28 days, and 5 ml/ min/ kg for infants on the day of birth.
Two to three hours post-dose, CSF/ plasma ratios of stavudine ranged from 16% to 125% (mean of 59%±35%).
Renal impairment: the clearance of stavudine decreases as creatinine clearance decreases; therefore, it is recommended that the dosage of Zerit be adjusted in patients with reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment: stavudine pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal data showed embryo-foetal toxicity at very high exposure levels.
An ex vivo study using a term human placenta model demonstrated that stavudine reaches the foetal circulation by simple diffusion.
A rat study also showed placental transfer of stavudine, with the foetal tissue concentration approximately 50% of the maternal plasma concentration.
Stavudine was genotoxic in in vitro tests in human lymphocytes possessing triphosphorylating activity (in which no no-effect level was established), in mouse fibroblasts, and in an in vivo test for chromosomal aberrations.
Similar effects have been observed with other nucleoside analogues.
Stavudine was carcinogenic in mice (liver tumours) and rats (liver tumours: cholangiocellular, hepatocellular, mixed hepatocholangiocellular, and/ or vascular; and urinary bladder carcinomas) at very high exposure levels.
No carcinogenicity was noted at doses of 400 mg/ kg/ day in mice and 600 mg/ kg/ day in rats, corresponding to exposures ~ 39 and 168 times the expected human exposure, respectively, suggesting an insignificant carcinogenic potential of stavudine in clinical therapy.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Zerit is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infected patients.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
The therapy should be initiated by a doctor experienced in the management of HIV infection (see also section 4.4).
Adults: the recommended dosage is:
Patient weight < 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
Zerit dosage 30 mg twice daily (every 12 hours) 40 mg twice daily (every 12 hours)
Adolescents, children and infants: the recommended dosage is:
Patient age and/ or weight From birth* to 13 days old
Zerit dosage 0.5 mg/ kg twice daily (every 12 hours)
At least 14 days old and < 30 kg 1 mg/ kg twice daily (every 12 hours)
≥ 30 kg
adult dosing
*The reduced posology in neonates from 0 to 13 days is based on average study data and may not correspond to invidual variation in kidney maturation.
Dosing recommendations are not available for neonates with a gestational age < 37 weeks.
For optimal absorption, Zerit should be taken on an empty stomach (i. e. at least 1 hour prior to meals) but, if this is not possible, it may be taken with a light meal.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Instructions for preparation, see section 6.6.
Dose adjustments
Peripheral neuropathy: if symptoms of peripheral neuropathy develop (usually characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands) (see section 4.4), patients should be switched to an alternative treatment regimen, if appropriate.
In the rare cases when this is
46 inappropriate, dose reduction of stavudine may be considered, while the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are under close monitoring and satisfactory virological suppression is maintained.
The possible benefits of a dose reduction should be balanced in each case against the risks - which may result from this measure (lower intracellular concentrations).
Hepatic impairment: no initial dosage adjustment is necessary.
Renal impairment: the following dosages are recommended:
Zerit dosage (according to creatinine clearance)
Patient weight
26-50 ml/ min
≤ 25 ml/ min (including dialysis dependence*)
< 60 kg ≥ 60 kg
15 mg twice daily 20 mg twice daily
15 mg every 24 hours 20 mg every 24 hours
* Patients on haemodialysis should take Zerit after the completion of haemodialysis, and at the same time on non-dialysis days.
Since urinary excretion is also a major route of elimination of stavudine in paediatric patients, the clearance of stavudine may be altered in paediatric patients with renal impairment.
Although there are insufficient data to recommend a specific dosage adjustment of Zerit in this patient population, a reduction in the dose and/ or an increase in the interval between doses proportional to the reduction for adults should be considered.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to stavudine or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Peripheral neuropathy: patients with a history of peripheral neuropathy are at increased risk for development of neuropathy.
If Zerit must be administered in this setting, careful clinical monitoring is essential.
Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are characterised by persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands.
Pancreatitis: patients with a history of pancreatitis had an incidence of approximately 5% on Zerit, as compared to approximately 2% in patients without such a history.
Patients with a high risk of pancreatitis or those receiving products known to be associated with pancreatitis should be closely followed for symptoms of this condition.
Lactic acidosis: lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis has been reported with the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
Early symptoms (symptomatic hyperlactatemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), non-specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid and/ or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness).
Lactic acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure, renal failure, or motor paralysis.
Lactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of treatment.
Treatment with NRTIs should be discontinued if there is symptomatic hyperlactatemia and metabolic/ lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels.
Caution should be exercised when administering NRTIs to any patient (particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol).
Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may constitute a special risk.
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely (see also section 4.6).
Liver disease: hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported.
The safety and efficacy of stavudine has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver
47 disorders.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events.
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice.
If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.
In the event of rapidly elevating transaminase levels (ALT/ AST, > 5 times upper limit of normal, ULN), discontinuation of Zerit and any potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products should be considered.
Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.
Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.
Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/ or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with the redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients.
The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.
Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete.
A connection between visceral lipomatosis and Protease Inhibitors and lipoatrophy and NRTIs has been hypothesised.
A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.
Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat redistribution.
Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood glucose.
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8).
There is evidence that mitochondrial DNA toxicity may be associated with specific features of lipoatrophy in patients using stavudine.
This should be taken into account when considering initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy with stavudine.
Osteonecrosis: although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.
Elderly:
Zerit has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.
Diabetic patients: the reconstituted powder for oral solution contains 50 mg sucrose per ml of reconstituted solution.
Infants under the age of 3 months: safety data is available from clinical trials up to 6 weeks of treatment in 179 newborns and infants < 3 months of age (see section 4.6).
Special consideration should be given to the antiretroviral treatment history and the resistance profile of the HIV strain of the mother.
Mitochondrial dysfunction: nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage.
There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed in utero and/ or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.8).
The main adverse events reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).
These events are often transitory.
48 Some late-onset neurological disorders have been reported (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).
Whether the neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.
Any child exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, even HIV-negative children, should have clinical and laboratory follow-up and should be fully investigated for possible mitochondrial dysfunction in case of relevant signs or symptoms.
These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.
Not recommended combinations: pancreatitis (fatal and nonfatal) and peripheral neuropathy (severe in some cases) have been reported in HIV infected patients receiving stavudine in association with hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV infected patients treated with antiretroviral agents and hydroxyurea; fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with stavudine, hydroxyurea and didanosine.
Hence, hydroxyurea should not be used in the treatment of HIV infection.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults
Since stavudine is actively secreted by the renal tubules, interactions with other actively secreted medicinal products are possible, e. g. with trimethoprim.
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction has, however, been seen with lamivudine.
Zidovudine and stavudine are phosphorylated by the cellular enzyme (thymidine kinase), which preferentially phosphorylates zidovudine, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of stavudine to its active triphosphate form.
Zidovudine is therefore not recommended to be used in combination with stavudine.
In vitro studies indicate that the activation of stavudine is inhibited by doxorubicin and ribavirin but not by other medicinal products used in HIV infection which are similarly phosphorylated, (e. g. didanosine, zalcitabine, ganciclovir and foscarnet) therefore, coadministration of stavudine with either doxorubicin or ribavirin should be undertaken with caution.
Stavudine’ s influence on the phosphorylation kinetics of nucleoside analogues other than zidovudine has not been investigated.
Clinically significant interactions of stavudine or stavudine plus didanosine with nelfinavir have not been observed.
Stavudine does not inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4; therefore, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur with drugs metabolised through these pathways.
Because stavudine is not protein-bound, it is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of protein-bound drugs.
There have been no formal interaction studies with other medicinal products.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Zerit should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Clinical experience in pregnant women is limited, but congenital anomalies and abortions have been reported.
In study AI455-094, performed in South-Africa, 362 mother-infant pairs were included in a prevention of mother-to-child-transmission study.
Treatment naive pregnant women were enrolled into the study at gestation week 34-36 and given antiretroviral treatment until delivery.
Antiretroviral prophylaxis, the same medications as given to the mother, was given to the new-born infant within 36 hours of
49 delivery and continued for 6 weeks.
In the stavudine containing arms, the neonates were treated for 6 weeks with stavudine 1 mg/ kg BID.
The follow-up time was up to 24 weeks of age.
The mother-infant pairs were randomised to receive either stavudine (N= 91), didanosine (N= 94), stavudine + didanosine (N= 88) or zidovudine (N= 89).
95% Confidence intervals for the mother-to-child-transmission rates were 5.4-19.3% (stavudine), 5.2-18.7% (didanosine); 1.3-11.2% (stavudine + didanosine); and 1.9-12.6% for zidovudine.
Preliminary safety data from this study (see also section 4.8), showed an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected in this study.
However, lactic acidosis (see section 4.4), sometimes fatal, has been reported in pregnant women who received the combination of didanosine and stavudine with or without other anti-retroviral treatment.
Embryo-foetal toxicities were seen only at high exposure levels in animals.
Preclinical studies showed placental transfer of stavudine (see section 5.3).
Until additional data become available, Zerit should be given during pregnancy only after special consideration; there is insufficient information to recommend Zerit for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Furthermore, the combination of stavudine and didanosine should be used with caution during pregnancy and is recommended only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk.
It is recommended that HIV infected women should not breast-feed under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV.
The data available on stavudine excretion into human breast milk are insufficient to assess the risk to the infant.
Studies in lactating rats showed that stavudine is excreted in breast milk.
Therefore, mothers should be instructed to discontinue breast-feeding prior to receiving Zerit.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Based on the pharmacodynamic properties of stavudine it is unlikely that Zerit affects the ability to drive or operate machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adults: extensive safety experience is available for Zerit used as monotherapy and in combination regimens.
Many of the serious undesirable effects with stavudine were consistent with the course of HIV infection or with the side effects of concomitant therapies.
Peripheral neuropathy:
In combination studies of Zerit with lamivudine plus efavirenz, the frequency of peripheral neurologic symptoms was 19% (6% for moderate to severe) with a rate of discontinuation due to neuropathy of 2%.
Dose-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in monotherapy trials with Zerit (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
The patients usually experienced resolution of symptoms after dose reduction or interruption.
Pancreatitis: pancreatitis, occasionally fatal, has been reported in up to 2-3% of patients enrolled in monotherapy clinical studies (see section 4.4).
Pancreatitis was reported in < 1% of patients in combination therapy studies with Zerit.
Lactic acidosis: cases of lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, usually associated with severe hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
Hepatitis or liver failure, which was fatal in some cases, has been reported with the use of stavudine and with other nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4).
50 Immune reactivation syndrome: in HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise (see section 4.4).
Lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities: combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia (see section 4.4).
Osteonecrosis: cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Undesirable effects (moderate to severe) were reported from 467 patients treated with Zerit in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in two randomised clinical trials and an ongoing long-term follow-up study (total follow-up: median 56 weeks ranging up to 119 weeks).
The following undesirable effects considered possibly related to study regimen based on investigators’ attribution, have been identified:
Endocrine disorders:
uncommon: gynaecomastia
Gastrointestinal disorders:
common: diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia uncommon: pancreatitis, vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions:
common: fatigue uncommon: asthenia
Hepatobiliary disorders:
uncommon: hepatitis or jaundice
Metabolism and nutrition disorders:
common: lipoatrophy, * lipodystrophy uncommon: lactic acidosis (in some cases involving motor weakness), anorexia
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
uncommon: arthralgia, myalgia
Nervous system disorders:
common: peripheral neurologic symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, and peripheral neuritis; dizziness; abnormal dreams; headache, insomnia; abnormal thinking; somnolence
Psychiatric disorders:
common: depression uncommon: anxiety, emotional lability
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
common: rash, pruritus uncommon: urticaria
51 *Lipoatrophy was observed in a long-term follow-up study of stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz (total follow-up: median 148 weeks ranging up to 207 weeks).
Discontinuation due to undesirable events was 7% for the patients treated with Zerit.
Laboratory abnormalities reported in these two trials and an ongoing follow-up study included elevations of ALT (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of AST (> 5 x ULN) in 3%, of lipase (≥ 2.1 ULN) in 3% of the patients in the Zerit group.
Neutropenia (< 750 cells/ mm3) was reported in 5%, thrombocytopenia (platelets < 50,000/ mm3) in 2%, and low haemoglobin (< 8 g/ dl) in < 1% of patients receiving Zerit.
Macrocytosis was not evaluated in these trials, but was found to be associated with Zerit in an earlier trial (MCV > 112 fl occurred in 30% of patients treated with Zerit).
Adolescents, children and infants: undesirable effects and serious laboratory abnormalities reported to occur in paediatric patients ranging in age from birth through adolescence who received stavudine in clinical studies were generally similar in type and frequency to those seen in adults.
However, clinically significant peripheral neuropathy is less frequent.
These studies include ACTG 240, where 105 paediatric patients ages 3 months to 6 years received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day for a median of 6.4 months; a controlled clinical trial where 185 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day either alone or in combination with didanosine from birth through 6 weeks of age; and a clinical trial where 8 newborns received Zerit 2 mg/ kg/ day in combination with didanosine and nelfinavir from birth through 4 weeks of age.
In study AI455-094 (see also section 4.6), the safety follow-up period was restricted to only six months, which may be insufficient to capture long-term data on neurological adverse events and mitochondrial toxicity.
Relevant grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities in the 91 stavudine treated infants were low neutrophils in 7%, low hemoglobin in 1%, ALT increase in 1% and no lipase abnormality.
Data on lactic acid in serum were not collected.
No notable differences in the frequency of adverse drug reactions were seen between treatment groups.
There was, however, an increased infant mortality in the stavudine + didanosine (10%) treatment group compared to the stavudine (2%), didanosine (3%) or zidovudine (6%) groups, with a higher incidence of stillbirths in the stavudine + didanosine group.
Postmarketing
The following events have been reported spontaneously during postmarketing experience:
Blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Not known: thrombocytopenia
Metabolic and nutrition disorders:
Common: asymptomatic hyperlactatemia, Not known: lactic acidosis
Hepatobiliary disorders:
Not known: liver failure, hepatitis and hepatic steatosis
Nervous system disorders:
Not known: motor weakness (most often reported in the setting of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis syndrome)
Mitochondrial dysfunction: review of the postmarketing safety database shows that adverse events indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction have been reported in the neonate and infant population exposed to one or more nucleoside analogues (see also section 4.4).
The HIV status for the newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age was negative, for older infants it tended to be positive.
The profile of the adverse events for newborns and infants ≤ 3 months of age showed increases in lactic acid levels, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic transaminase increases and increased lipids, including hypertriglyceridaemia.
The number of reports in older infants was too small to identify a pattern.
52 4.9 Overdose
Experience in adults treated with up to 12 times the recommended daily dosage revealed no acute toxicity.
Complications of chronic overdosage could include peripheral neuropathy and hepatic dysfunction.
The mean haemodialysis clearance of stavudine is 120 ml/ min.
The contribution of this to the total elimination in an overdose situation is unknown.
It is not known whether stavudine is removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ATC code:
J05AF04
Stavudine, a thymidine analogue, is an antiviral agent with in vitro activity against HIV in human cells.
It is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to stavudine triphosphate which inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine triphosphate.
It also inhibits viral DNA synthesis by causing DNA chain termination due to a lack of the 3’ -hydroxyl group necessary for DNA elongation.
Cellular DNA polymerase γ is also sensitive to inhibition by stavudine triphosphate, while cellular polymerases α and β are inhibited at concentrations 4,000-fold and 40-fold higher, respectively, than that needed to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase.
Stavudine treatment can select for and/ or maintain mutations associated with zidovudine resistance.
Isolates containing these mutations remain sensitive to stavudine.
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.
The activity of stavudine is affected by multi-drug resistance associated mutations such as Q151 M.
A more than 10-fold reduced sensitivity to stavudine has been reported for some strains with reduced sensitivity to zidovudine and lamivudine.
No mutations associated with high degree resistance specifically to stavudine have been revealed in vivo.
Clinical efficacy
Zerit has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents, e. g. didanosine, lamivudine, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, efavirenz, and nelfinavir.
Study AI455-099 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study withZerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 391 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 272 cells/ mm3 (range 61 to 1,215 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.80 log10 copies/ ml (range 2.6 to 5.9 log 10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (70%) and non-white (58%) with a median age of 33 years (range 18 to 68 years).
Study AI455-096 was a 48-week, randomised, double-blind study with Zerit (40 mg twice daily), in combination with lamivudine (150 mg twice daily) plus efavirenz (600 mg once daily), in 76 treatment-naive patients, with a median CD4 cell count of 261 cells/ mm3 (range 63 to 962 cells/ mm3) and a median plasma HIV-1 RNA of 4.63 log10 copies/ ml (range 3.0 to 5.9 log10 copies/ ml) at baseline.
Patients were primarily males (76%) and white (66%) with a median age of 34 years (range 22 to 67 years).

Only the data from the marketed formulation is presented.
In adolescents, children and infants, use of stavudine is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in paediatric patients (see also sections 4.8 and 5.2).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Adults
Absorption: the absolute bioavailability is 86±18%.
After multiple oral administration of 0.5-0.67 mg/ kg doses, a Cmax value of 810±175 ng/ ml was obtained.
Cmax and AUC increased proportionally with dose in the dose ranges, intravenous 0.0625-0.75 mg/ kg, and oral 0.033-4.0 mg/ kg.
In eight patients receiving 40 mg twice daily in the fasted state, steady-state AUC0-12h was 1284±227 ng⋅ h/ ml (18%) (mean ± SD [% CV]), Cmax was 536±146 ng/ ml (27%), and Cmin was 9±8 ng/ ml (89%).
A study in asymptomatic patients demonstrated that systemic exposure is similar while Cmax is lower and Tmax is prolonged when stavudine is administered with a standardised, high-fat meal compared with fasting conditions.
The clinical significance of this is unknown.
Distribution: the apparent volume of distribution at steady state is 46±21 l.
It was not possible to detect stavudine in cerebrospinal fluid until at least 2 hours after oral administration.
Four hours after administration, the CSF/ plasma ratio was 0.39±0.06.
No significant accumulation of stavudine is observed with repeated administration every 6, 8, or 12 hours.
Binding of stavudine to serum proteins was negligible over the concentration range of 0.01 to 11.4 µg/ ml.
Stavudine distributes equally between red blood cells and plasma.
Metabolism: the metabolism of stavudine has not been elucidated in humans.
Studies in monkeys indicate that approximately 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine, most of the remainder is hydrolysed to thymine and sugar.
Elimination: the terminal elimination half-life is 1.3±0.2 hours after a single dose, and 1.4±0.2 hours after multiple doses, and is independent of dose.
In vitro, stavudine triphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 3.5 hours in CEM T-cells (a human T-lymphoblastoid cell line) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, supporting twice daily dosing.
Total clearance of stavudine is 594±164 ml/ min, and renal clearance is 237±98 ml/ min, indicating active tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration.
After intravenous administration, 42±7% of dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.
The corresponding values after oral single and multiple dose administration are 34±5% and 40±12%, respectively.
The remaining 60% of the drug is presumably eliminated by endogenous pathways.
The half-life of stavudine is approximately 2 hours.
The pharmacokinetics of stavudine was independent of time, since the ratio between AUC(ss) at steady state and the AUC(0-t) after the first dose was approximately 1.
Intra-and interindividual variation in
54 pharmacokinetic characteristics of stavudine is low, approximately 15% and 25%, respectively, after oral administration.
Special Populations
Adolescents, children and infants: total exposure to stavudine was comparable between adolescents, children and infants ≥ 14 days receiving the 2 mg/ kg/ day dose and adults receiving 1 mg/ kg/ day.
Apparent oral clearance was approximately 14 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 5 weeks to 15 years, 12 ml/ min/ kg for infants ages 14 to 28 days, and 5 ml/ min/ kg for infants on the day of birth.
Two to three hours post-dose, CSF/ plasma ratios of stavudine ranged from 16% to 125% (mean of 59%±35%).
Renal impairment: the clearance of stavudine decreases as creatinine clearance decreases; therefore, it is recommended that the dosage of Zerit be adjusted in patients with reduced renal function (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment: stavudine pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal data showed embryo-foetal toxicity at very high exposure levels.
An ex vivo study using a term human placenta model demonstrated that stavudine reaches the foetal circulation by simple diffusion.
A rat study also showed placental transfer of stavudine, with the foetal tissue concentration approximately 50% of the maternal plasma concentration.
Stavudine was genotoxic in in vitro tests in human lymphocytes possessing triphosphorylating activity (in which no no-effect level was established), in mouse fibroblasts, and in an in vivo test for chromosomal aberrations.
Similar effects have been observed with other nucleoside analogues.
Stavudine was carcinogenic in mice (liver tumours) and rats (liver tumours: cholangiocellular, hepatocellular, mixed hepatocholangiocellular, and/ or vascular; and urinary bladder carcinomas) at very high exposure levels.
No carcinogenicity was noted at doses of 400 mg/ kg/ day in mice and 600 mg/ kg/ day in rats, corresponding to exposures ~ 39 and 168 times the expected human exposure, respectively, suggesting an insignificant carcinogenic potential of stavudine in clinical therapy.

Further information
1.
WHAT Zerit IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Zerit belongs to a group of antiviral medicines, also known as antiretrovirals, called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
These are used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.
This medicinal product, in combination with other antiretrovirals, reduces the HIV viral load and keeps it at a low level.
It also increases CD4 cell counts.
These CD4 cells play an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection.
Response to treatment with Zerit varies between patients.
Your doctor will therefore be monitoring the effectiveness of your treatment.
Zerit may improve your condition, but it is not a cure for your HIV infection.
Treatment with Zerit has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV infection on to others by sexual contact or by blood transfer.
Therefore, you must continue to take appropriate precautions to avoid giving the virus to others.
During your treatment, other infections linked to your weakened immunity (opportunistic infections) may arise.
These will require specific and sometimes preventive treatment.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE Zerit
Do not take Zerit:
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to stavudine or any of the other ingredients of Zerit.
Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
Take special care with Zerit:
Before treatment with Zerit, you should have told your doctor: if you suffer from kidney disease or liver disease (such as hepatitis), if you have had peripheral neuropathy (persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands), or if you have suffered from pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
The class of medicines to which Zerit belongs (NRTIs) can cause a sometimes fatal condition called lactic acidosis, together with an enlarged liver.
This condition usually does not occur until a few
84 months after onset of treatment.
This rare, but very serious side effect occurs more often in women, particularly if very overweight.
In addition, rare cases of liver failure/ renal failure or fatal hepatitis have been reported.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk for severe and potentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver function.
If you develop one of the following, contact your doctor: persistent numbness, tingling or pain in feet and/ or hands (this may indicate the beginning of peripheral neuropathy, an adverse effect on the nerves), muscular weakness or abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or rapid deep breathing, drowsiness (which may indicate pancreatitis, liver disturbance such as hepatitis, or lactic acidosis).
In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started.
It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’ s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.
If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.
Redistribution, accumulation, or loss of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.
Some NRTIs, such as stavudine, have been associated with a loss of body fat (lipoatrophy).
Contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat.
Bone problems: some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease.
Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.
If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Except for zidovudine, which interferes with the activity of stavudine, Zerit may be taken with many of the other medicines commonly used in patients with HIV infection.
These include the protease inhibitors (such as nelfinavir) and NRTIs.
Please tell your doctor if you are taking doxorubicin or ribavirin as undesirable interactions may occur.
Taking Zerit with food and drink:
For maximum effect, Zerit should be taken on an empty stomach, and preferably at least one hour before a meal.
If this is not possible, the capsules may also be taken with a light meal.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding:
Pregnancy If you become pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, you must contact your doctor to discuss the potential adverse effects and the benefits and risks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child.
Lactic acidosis (sometimes fatal) has been reported in pregnant women who received stavudine in combination with other antiretroviral treatment.
If you have taken Zerit during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular visits to monitor the development of your child.
Such visits may include blood tests and other diagnostic tests.
In children whose mother took nucleoside and nucleotide analogues during pregnancy, the benefit from the reduced chance of being infected with HIV is greater than the risk of suffering from side effects.
85 Breast-feeding Inform your doctor if you are breast-feeding.
It is recommended that HIV-infected women should not breast-feed under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV to the baby.
Driving and using machines:
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Zerit:
These capsules contain lactose.
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
3.
HOW TO TAKE Zerit
Always take Zerit exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor if you are not sure.
Your doctor has defined your daily dose based on your weight and individual characteristics.
Please follow these recommendations closely as they will give you the best chance to delay development of a resistance to the medicinal product.
Do not change the dose on your own.
Continue to take this medicine until your doctor tells you otherwise.
For adults and children whose body weight is 30 kg or more, the usual starting dose is 30 or 40 mg given twice daily (with approximately 12 hours between each dose).
Children older than 3 months, whose body weight is less than 30 kg, should receive 1 mg/ kg twice daily.
To obtain optimal absorption, the capsules should be swallowed with a glass of water, preferentially at least one hour before a meal and on an empty stomach.
If this is not possible, Zerit may also be taken with a light meal.
If you have problems swallowing capsules you should ask your doctor about the possibility of changing to the solution form of this medicine or you could carefully open the capsule and mix its contents with some food.
If you take more Zerit than you should:
If you have taken too many capsules or if someone accidentally swallows some, there is no immediate danger.
However, you should contact your doctor or the nearest hospital for advice.
If you forget to take Zerit:
If you accidentally miss a dose, then simply take your normal dose when the next one is due.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Zerit:
The decision to stop using Zerit should be discussed with your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Zerit can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to differentiate between unwanted effects caused by Zerit, or those caused by any other medicines you may be taking at the same time, or by the complications of the infection.
For this reason, it is important that you inform your doctor of any change in your health.
The most frequently reported side effects in adults taking Zerit in combination with other HIV medicinal products (lamivudine and efavirenz) were skin rash, headache, dizziness and peripheral
86 neuropathy.
Serious but uncommon side effects are pancreatitis, liver disturbance or lactic acidosis.
Other side effects have been reported: fatigue, nausea/ vomiting, diarrhoea, indigestion, abdominal pain, fat redistribution (including breast enlargement in women), breast enlargement in men, numbness or weakness of arms and legs, muscle aching.
Some patients in studies of adults taking Zerit in combination with other HIV drugs (lamivudine and efavirenz) experienced changes in mood or ability to think clearly.
These symptoms include anxiety, sleeping problems, depression, abnormal thinking, abnormal dreams.
Combination antiretroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat distribution.
These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen ("belly") and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck ("buffalo hump").
The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time.
Combination antiretroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood, hyperlipaemia (increased fats in the blood) and resistance to insulin.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell you doctor or pharmacist.

1.
WHAT Zerit IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Zerit belongs to a group of antiviral medicines, also known as antiretrovirals, called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
These are used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.
This medicinal product, in combination with other antiretrovirals, reduces the HIV viral load and keeps it at a low level.
It also increases CD4 cell counts.
These CD4 cells play an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection.
Response to treatment with Zerit varies between patients.
Your doctor will therefore be monitoring the effectiveness of your treatment.
Zerit may improve your condition, but it is not a cure for your HIV infection.
Treatment with Zerit has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV infection on to others by sexual contact or by blood transfer.
Therefore, you must continue to take appropriate precautions to avoid giving the virus to others.
During your treatment, other infections linked to your weakened immunity (opportunistic infections) may arise.
These will require specific and sometimes preventive treatment.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE Zerit
Do not take Zerit:
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to stavudine or any of the other ingredients of Zerit.
Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
Take special care with Zerit:
Before treatment with Zerit, you should have told your doctor: if you suffer from kidney disease or liver disease (such as hepatitis), if you have had peripheral neuropathy (persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands), or if you have suffered from pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
The class of medicines to which Zerit belongs (NRTIs) can cause a sometimes fatal condition called lactic acidosis, together with an enlarged liver.
This condition usually does not occur until a few
90 months after onset of treatment.
This rare, but very serious side effect occurs more often in women, particularly if very overweight.
In addition, rare cases of liver failure/ renal failure or fatal hepatitis have been reported.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk for severe and potentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver function.
If you develop one of the following, contact your doctor: persistent numbness, tingling or pain in feet and/ or hands (this may indicate the beginning of peripheral neuropathy, an adverse effect on the nerves), muscular weakness or abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or rapid deep breathing, drowsiness (which may indicate pancreatitis, liver disturbance such as hepatitis, or lactic acidosis).
In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started.
It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’ s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.
If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.
Redistribution, accumulation, or loss of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.
Some NRTIs, such as stavudine, have been associated with a loss of body fat (lipoatrophy).
Contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat.
Bone problems: some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease.
Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.
If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Except for zidovudine, which interferes with the activity of stavudine, Zerit may be taken with many of the other medicines commonly used in patients with HIV infection.
These include the protease inhibitors (such as nelfinavir) and NRTIs.
Please tell your doctor if you are taking doxorubicin or ribavirin as undesirable interactions may occur.
Taking Zerit with food and drink:
For maximum effect, Zerit should be taken on an empty stomach, and preferably at least one hour before a meal.
If this is not possible, the capsules may also be taken with a light meal.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding:
Pregnancy If you become pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, you must contact your doctor to discuss the potential adverse effects and the benefits and risks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child.
Lactic acidosis (sometimes fatal) has been reported in pregnant women who received stavudine in combination with other antiretroviral treatment.
If you have taken Zerit during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular visits to monitor the development of your child.
Such visits may include blood tests and other diagnostic tests.
In children whose mother took nucleoside and nucleotide analogues during pregnancy, the benefit from the reduced chance of being infected with HIV is greater than the risk of suffering from side effects.
91 Breast-feeding Inform your doctor if you are breast-feeding.
It is recommended that HIV-infected women should not breast-feed under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV to the baby.
Driving and using machines:
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Zerit:
These capsules contain lactose.
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
3.
HOW TO TAKE Zerit
Always take Zerit exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor if you are not sure.
Your doctor has defined your daily dose based on your weight and individual characteristics.
Please follow these recommendations closely as they will give you the best chance to delay development of a resistance to the medicinal product.
Do not change the dose on your own.
Continue to take this medicine until your doctor tells you otherwise.
For adults and children whose body weight is 30 kg or more, the usual starting dose is 30 or 40 mg given twice daily (with approximately 12 hours between each dose).
Children older than 3 months, whose body weight is less than 30 kg, should receive 1 mg/ kg twice daily.
To obtain optimal absorption, the capsules should be swallowed with a glass of water, preferentially at least one hour before a meal and on an empty stomach.
If this is not possible, Zerit may also be taken with a light meal.
If you have problems swallowing capsules you should ask your doctor about the possibility of changing to the solution form of this medicine or you could carefully open the capsule and mix its contents with some food.
If you take more Zerit than you should:
If you have taken too many capsules or if someone accidentally swallows some, there is no immediate danger.
However, you should contact your doctor or the nearest hospital for advice.
If you forget to take Zerit:
If you accidentally miss a dose, then simply take your normal dose when the next one is due.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Zerit:
The decision to stop using Zerit should be discussed with your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Zerit can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to differentiate between unwanted effects caused by Zerit, or those caused by any other medicines you may be taking at the same time, or by the complications of the infection.
For this reason, it is important that you inform your doctor of any change in your health.
The most frequently reported side effects in adults taking Zerit in combination with other HIV medicinal products (lamivudine and efavirenz) were skin rash, headache, dizziness and peripheral
92 neuropathy.
Serious but uncommon side effects are pancreatitis, liver disturbance or lactic acidosis.
Other side effects have been reported: fatigue, nausea/ vomiting, diarrhoea, indigestion, abdominal pain, fat redistribution (including breast enlargement in women), breast enlargement in men, numbness or weakness of arms and legs, muscle aching.
Some patients in studies of adults taking Zerit in combination with other HIV drugs (lamivudine and efavirenz) experienced changes in mood or ability to think clearly.
These symptoms include anxiety, sleeping problems, depression, abnormal thinking, abnormal dreams.
Combination antiretroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat distribution.
These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen ("belly") and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck ("buffalo hump").
The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time.
Combination antiretroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood, hyperlipaemia (increased fats in the blood) and resistance to insulin.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell you doctor or pharmacist.
5.
HOW TO STORE Zerit
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Do not store above 30°C.
Store in the original package.
Do not use Zerit after the expiry date which is stated on the carton, the bottle label and/ or the blister after EXP.
The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required.
These measures will help to protect the environment.

1.
WHAT Zerit IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Zerit belongs to a group of antiviral medicines, also known as antiretrovirals, called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
These are used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.
This medicinal product, in combination with other antiretrovirals, reduces the HIV viral load and keeps it at a low level.
It also increases CD4 cell counts.
These CD4 cells play an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection.
Response to treatment with Zerit varies between patients.
Your doctor will therefore be monitoring the effectiveness of your treatment.
Zerit may improve your condition, but it is not a cure for your HIV infection.
Treatment with Zerit has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing HIV infection on to others by sexual contact or by blood transfer.
Therefore, you must continue to take appropriate precautions to avoid giving the virus to others.
During your treatment, other infections linked to your weakened immunity (opportunistic infections) may arise.
These will require specific and sometimes preventive treatment.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE Zerit
Do not take Zerit:
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to stavudine or any of the other ingredients of Zerit.
Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
Take special care with Zerit:
Before treatment with Zerit, you should have told your doctor: if you suffer from kidney disease or liver disease (such as hepatitis), if you have had peripheral neuropathy (persistent numbness, tingling, or pain in the feet and/ or hands), or if you have suffered from pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
The class of medicines to which Zerit belongs (NRTIs) can cause a sometimes fatal condition called lactic acidosis, together with an enlarged liver.
This condition usually does not occur until a few
102 months after onset of treatment.
This rare, but very serious side effect occurs more often in women, particularly if very overweight.
In addition, rare cases of liver failure/ renal failure or fatal hepatitis have been reported.
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral agents are at increased risk for severe and potentially fatal liver adverse events and may require blood tests for control of liver function.
If you develop one of the following, contact your doctor: persistent numbness, tingling or pain in feet and/ or hands (this may indicate the beginning of peripheral neuropathy, an adverse effect on the nerves), muscular weakness or abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or rapid deep breathing, drowsiness (which may indicate pancreatitis, liver disturbance such as hepatitis, or lactic acidosis).
In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started.
It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’ s immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.
If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.
Redistribution, accumulation, or loss of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.
Some NRTIs, such as stavudine, have been associated with a loss of body fat (lipoatrophy).
Contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat.
Bone problems: some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).
The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease.
Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement.
If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Except for zidovudine, which interferes with the activity of stavudine, Zerit may be taken with many of the other medicines commonly used in patients with HIV infection.
These include the protease inhibitors (such as nelfinavir) and NRTIs.
Please tell your doctor if you are taking doxorubicin or ribavirin as undesirable interactions may occur.
Taking Zerit with food and drink:
For maximum effect, Zerit should be taken on an empty stomach, and preferably at least one hour before a meal.
If this is not possible, the capsules may also be taken with a light meal.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding:
Pregnancy If you become pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, you must contact your doctor to discuss the potential adverse effects and the benefits and risks of your antiretroviral therapy to you and your child.
Lactic acidosis (sometimes fatal) has been reported in pregnant women who received stavudine in combination with other antiretroviral treatment.
If you have taken Zerit during your pregnancy, your doctor may request regular visits to monitor the development of your child.
Such visits may include blood tests and other diagnostic tests.
In children whose mother took nucleoside and nucleotide analogues during pregnancy, the benefit from the reduced chance of being infected with HIV is greater than the risk of suffering from side effects.
103 Breast-feeding Inform your doctor if you are breast-feeding.
It is recommended that HIV-infected women should not breast-feed under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV to the baby.
Driving and using machines:
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Zerit:
These capsules contain lactose.
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
3.
HOW TO TAKE Zerit
Always take Zerit exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor if you are not sure.
Your doctor has defined your daily dose based on your weight and individual characteristics.
Please follow these recommendations closely as they will give you the best chance to delay development of a resistance to the medicinal product.
Do not change the dose on your own.
Continue to take this medicine until your doctor tells you otherwise.
For adults and children whose body weight is 30 kg or more, the usual starting dose is 30 or 40 mg given twice daily (with approximately 12 hours between each dose).
Children older than 3 months, whose body weight is less than 30 kg, should receive 1 mg/ kg twice daily.
To obtain optimal absorption, the capsules should be swallowed with a glass of water, preferentially at least one hour before a meal and on an empty stomach.
If this is not possible, Zerit may also be taken with a light meal.
If you have problems swallowing capsules you should ask your doctor about the possibility of changing to the solution form of this medicine or you could carefully open the capsule and mix its contents with some food.
If you take more Zerit than you should:
If you have taken too many capsules or if someone accidentally swallows some, there is no immediate danger.
However, you should contact your doctor or the nearest hospital for advice.
If you forget to take Zerit:
If you accidentally miss a dose, then simply take your normal dose when the next one is due.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you stop taking Zerit:
The decision to stop using Zerit should be discussed with your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Zerit can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
When treating HIV infection, it is not always possible to differentiate between unwanted effects caused by Zerit, or those caused by any other medicines you may be taking at the same time, or by the complications of the infection.
For this reason, it is important that you inform your doctor of any change in your health.
The most frequently reported side effects in adults taking Zerit in combination with other HIV medicinal products (lamivudine and efavirenz) were skin rash, headache, dizziness and peripheral
104 neuropathy.
Serious but uncommon side effects are pancreatitis, liver disturbance or lactic acidosis.
Other side effects have been reported: fatigue, nausea/ vomiting, diarrhoea, indigestion, abdominal pain, fat redistribution (including breast enlargement in women), breast enlargement in men, numbness or weakness of arms and legs, muscle aching.
Some patients in studies of adults taking Zerit in combination with other HIV drugs (lamivudine and efavirenz) experienced changes in mood or ability to think clearly.
These symptoms include anxiety, sleeping problems, depression, abnormal thinking, abnormal dreams.
Combination antiretroviral therapy may cause changes in body shape due to changes in fat distribution.
These may include loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen ("belly") and other internal organs, breast enlargement and fatty lumps on the back of the neck ("buffalo hump").
The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time.
Combination antiretroviral therapy may also cause raised lactic acid and sugar in the blood, hyperlipaemia (increased fats in the blood) and resistance to insulin.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell you doctor or pharmacist.
5.
HOW TO STORE Zerit
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Do not store above 30°C.
Store in the original package.
Do not use Zerit after the expiry date which is stated on the carton, the bottle label and/ or the blister after EXP.
The expiry date refers to the last day of that month.
Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste.
Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medicines no longer required.
These measures will help to protect the environment.
