Description: %1
Here you can choose from a list of predefined widget styles (e. g. the way buttons are drawn) which may or may not be combined with a theme (additional information like a marble texture or a gradient).
This area shows a preview of the currently selected style without having to apply it to the whole desktop.
This page allows you to choose details about the widget style options
No Text: Shows only icons on toolbar buttons. Best option for low resolutions. Text Only: Shows only text on toolbar buttons. Text Beside Icons: Shows icons and text on toolbar buttons. Text is aligned beside the icon. Text Below Icons: Shows icons and text on toolbar buttons. Text is aligned below the icon.
If you enable this option, KDE Applications will show small icons alongside some important buttons.
If you enable this option, KDE Applications will run internal animations.

Selected style: %1 One or more effects that you have chosen could not be applied because the selected style does not support them; they have therefore been disabled.
Menu translucency is not available.
Menu drop-shadows are not available.
If you check this box, you can select several effects for different widgets like combo boxes, menus or tooltips.
Disable: do not use any combo box effects. Animate: Do some animation.
Disable: do not use any tooltip effects. Animate: Do some animation. Fade: Fade in tooltips using alpha-blending.
Disable: do not use any menu effects. Animate: Do some animation. Fade: Fade in menus using alpha-blending. Make Translucent: Alpha-blend menus for a see-through effect. (KDE styles only)
When enabled, all popup menus will have a drop-shadow, otherwise drop-shadows will not be displayed. At present, only KDE styles can have this effect enabled.
Software Tint: Alpha-blend using a flat color. Software Blend: Alpha-blend using an image. XRender Blend: Use the XFree RENDER extension for image blending (if available). This method may be slower than the Software routines on non-accelerated displays, but may however improve performance on remote displays.
By adjusting this slider you can control the menu effect opacity.
Note: that all widgets in this combobox do not apply to Qt-only applications.
If you check this box, the toolbars will be transparent when moving them around.
If you enable this option some pop-up menus will show so called tear-off handles. If you click them, you get the menu inside a widget. This can be very helpful when performing the same action multiple times.
