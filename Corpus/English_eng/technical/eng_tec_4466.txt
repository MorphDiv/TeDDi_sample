(PHP 3 = 3.0.1, PHP 4)
pg_fetch_row() fetches one row of data from the result associated with the specified result resource.
The row (record) is returned as an array.
Each result column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 0.
It returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
See also: pg_query(), pg_fetch_array(), pg_fetch_object() and pg_fetch_result().
Example 1.
Postgres fetch row
?php $conn = pg_pconnect ("dbname=publisher"); if (!$conn) {echo "An error occured.\n"; exit;} $result = pg_query ($conn, "SELECT * FROM authors"); if (!$result) {echo "An error occured.\n"; exit;} while ($row = pg_fetch_row($result, $i)) {for ($j=0; $j count($row); $j++) {echo "$row[$j] nbsp ;";} echo "BR";}?
Note:
From 4.1.0, row became optional.
Calling pg_fetch_row() will increment internal row counter by 1.
