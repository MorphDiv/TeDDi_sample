Drop (remove) a project using specified database driver and database name. You will be asked for confirmation.
Database driver to be used for connecting to a database project (SQLite by default). Ignored if a shortcut filename is provided.
Specify the type of file provided as an argument. This option is only useful if the filename does not have a valid extension set and its type cannot be determined unambiguously by examining its contents. This option is ignored if no file is specified as an argument. Available file types are: - "project" for a project file (the default) - "shortcut" for a shortcut file pointing to a project. - "connection" for database connection data.
Specify a database connection shortcut. kexic file containing connection data. Can be used with --createdb or --create-opendb for convenience instead of using options like --user, --host or --port. Note: Options like --user, --host have precedence over settings defined in the shortcut file.
Specify that any database connections will be performed without write support. This option is ignored when "createdb" option is present, otherwise the database could not be created.
