Introduction
& irkick; is a background server that provides the'glue 'between the operating system and your applications for the purpose of controlling applications with your infrared remote controls.
It has a configuration tool, which may be accessed either by the KDE Control Center or directly from the menu of & irkick;.
Requirements
For the KDELirc framework to be utilised you must have setup a LIRC on your computer. If it is properly set up, the & irkick; icon in the system tray will light up red. If not, it will be grey and crossed out.
For more information about LIRC, visit the project's website at www. lirc. org.
Using & irkick;
& irkick; provides one main function: When a button on a remote control is pressed, it will temporarily become lit up. Aside from this & irkick; does little for the user directly aside from telling them of the activity of their remote controls.
Using the right-mouse-button menu, you can configure the KDE infrared remote control framework.
