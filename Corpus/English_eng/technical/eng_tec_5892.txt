Working with Plug-ins
Kate is using two different forms of plug-ins, namely plug-ins for the & kate; application and plug-ins for the & kate; editor component. The latter are available to any application using the editor component, such as KDevelop, Quanta, Kile, Kwrite and many others, while application plug-ins are specific to the & kate; application.
You can enable both types of plug-ins in the configuration dialog, which also provides access to additional configuration options for plug-ins that requires that.
There are many plugins for various purposes available in the kdeaddons module, and you can search the web for more. A few plugins are shipped with the editor component, for doing word completion, automatic bookmarks, insert files, thesaurus and word spell checking and incremental search.
