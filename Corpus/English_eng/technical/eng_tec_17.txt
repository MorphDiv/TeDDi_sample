Trend Lines
Regression curves, also known as trend lines, can be added to all 2-D chart types except for Pie and Stock charts.
None
No trend line is shown.
Linear
A linear trend line is shown.
Logarithmic
A logarithmic trend line is shown.
Exponential
An exponential trend line is shown.
Power
A power trend line is shown.
Show equation
Shows the trend line equation next to the trend line.
Show correlation coefficient (R2)
Shows the coefficient of determination next to the trend line.
Line
or
Column
, then the numbers 1, 2, 3,
…
are used as x-values to calculate the trend line.
Insert - Trend Lines
, then select the type of trend line from None, Linear, Logarithmic, Exponential, or Power trend line.
Insert - Trend Line
.
To delete a single trend line or mean value line, click the line, then press the Del key.
Insert - Trend Lines
, then select
None
.
A trend line is shown in the legend automatically.
Insert - Mean Value Lines
to insert mean value lines for all data series.
A single mean value line can be inserted by the
Insert Mean Value Line
command of the context menu of a data series.

When the chart is in edit mode, %PRODUCTNAME gives you the equation of the trend line and the coefficient of determination R².
Click on the trend line to see the information in the status bar.
For a category chart (for example a line chart), the regression information is calculated using numbers 1, 2, 3, … as x-values.
This is also true if your data series uses other numbers as names for the x-values.
For such charts the X-Y chart type might be more suitable.

Enable Show Coefficient of Determination to see the coefficient of determination of the regression curve.
You can also calculate the parameters using Calc functions as follows.
The linear regression equation
linear regression
follows the equation
y=m*x+b
.
m = SLOPE(DataY; DataX)
b = INTERCEPT(DataY; DataX)
Calculate the coefficient of determination by
r² = RSQ(DataY; DataX)
LINEST
provides additional statistics for a regression analysis.
The logarithm regression equation
logarithm regression
follows the equation
y=a*ln(x)+b
.
a = SLOPE(DataY; LN(DataX))
b = INTERCEPT(DataY; LN(DataX))
r² = RSQ(DataY; LN(DataX))
The exponential regression equation
For exponential regression curves a transformation to a linear model takes place.
The optimal curve fitting is related to the linear model and the results are interpreted accordingly.
y=b*exp(a*x)
or
y=b*m^x
, which is transformed to
ln(y) = ln(b) + a*x
or
ln(y) = ln(b) + ln(m)*x
respectively.
a = SLOPE(LN(DataY); DataX)
The variables for the second variation are calculated as follows:
m = EXP(SLOPE(LN(DataY); DataX))
b = EXP(INTERCEPT(LN(DataY); DataX))
Calculate the coefficient of determination by
r² = RSQ(LN(DataY); DataX)
Besides m, b and r² the array function LOGEST provides additional statistics for a regression analysis.
The power regression equation
power regression
curves a transformation to a linear model takes place.
The power regression follows the equation
y = b * x^a
, which is transformed to
ln(y) = ln(b) + a * ln(x)
.
a = SLOPE(LN(DataY); LN(DataX))
b = EXP(INTERCEPT(LN(DataY); LN(DataX))
r² = RSQ(LN(DataY); LN(DataX))
Constraints
The calculation of the trend line considers only data pairs with the following values:
logarithm regression: only positive x-values are considered,
exponential regression: only positive y-values are considered,
power regression: only positive x-values and positive y-values are considered.
You should transform your data accordingly; it is best to work on a copy of the original data and transform the copied data.
The polynomial regression equation
polynomial regression
curve cannot be added automatically.
You must calculate this curve manually.
Create a table with the columns x, x², x³, … xⁿ, y up to the desired degree n.
=LINEST(DataY, DataX)
with the complete range x to xⁿ (without headings) as DataX.
The first row of the LINEST output contains the coefficients of the regression polynomial, with the coefficient of xⁿ at the leftmost position.
