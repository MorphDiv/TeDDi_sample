mssql_free_statement() only needs to be called if you are worried about using too much memory while your script is running.
All statement memory will automatically be freed when the script ends.
You may call mssql_free_statement() with the statement identifier as an argument and the associated statement memory will be freed.
See also mssql_bind(), mssql_execute() and mssql_init()
