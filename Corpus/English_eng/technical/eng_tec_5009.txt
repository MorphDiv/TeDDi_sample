(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns:
A positive Sybase result identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
sybase_query() sends a query to the currently active database on the server that's associated with the specified link identifier.
If the link identifier isn 't specified, the last opened link is assumed.
If no link is open, the function tries to establish a link as if sybase_connect() was called, and use it.
See also: sybase_db_query(), sybase_select_db(), and sybase_connect().
