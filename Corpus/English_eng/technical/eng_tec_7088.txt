Introduction

The rules of Sudoku are quite simple. In order to complete the puzzle, you must fill each square with a number between 1 and 9 such that every row, column and 3x3 box on the board contains the numbers 1 through 9. Stated another way, you must fill each square such that no number appears twice in the same row, column, or 3x3 box.
These two different ways of looking at the puzzle are two of the principle ways players think as they play. On the one hand, you ask yourself, “How can I fit all the numbers in this box?” On the other hand, you ask yourself, “What numbers can fit in this square without causing a conflict with other numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 box?”
In spite of the simplicity of the game, Sudoku puzzles can vary widely in their difficulty.

You can change puzzles at any time by pressing
Basic game play
To play the game, start filling numbers 1-9 in the squares such that no row, column, or 3x3 box has any number more than one time.
You can fill a number in a square with the keyboard or the mouse.
Keyboard
Use the arrow keys or the mouse to select the square you would like to fill. Then type the number you want to put in the square. Typing
Mouse
Click on a square to select it, then click in the center of the square to bring up buttons with the numbers 1-9. Click on a number to select it, or click on
If you enter a number that is in conflict with other numbers on the grid, the conflicting numbers will be highlighted in red.
Error highlighting
An illegal move will be highlighted in red.

Features
GNOME Sudoku provides a number of features that help you play puzzles.
Notes

Hints and Auto-Fill
You can use
Highlighting
In highlighting mode, the current row, column and box are highlighted in different colors to make scanning the board easier.
Trackers
Trackers make trial-and-error solutions easier to keep track of. When you
Taking Notes
To write notes (also known as “pencilmarks”) in a square, first select the square with the keyboard or mouse. Then, do one of the following:
Click in the upper region of the square (the region is highlighted with a square when you move the mouse over a selected square).
Type
This will bring up a field in which you can type your notes. Type
You can also take notes in the bottom of the square by clicking in the bottom of the square or by typing
The
Hints
GNOME Sudoku can give you hints based on your current board. You can ask for a hint for the currently selected square by clicking
When you click on Hint, possible values are shown in the bottom of a square.
If you want to remove or alter the hint, you can edit the text by clicking in the bottom of the square.
For very difficult puzzles, you can choose to have

A difficult puzzle with Always-Show Hint Mode enabled.
Fill Square
To automatically fill in a square for which there is only one possible value, you can click
If there are more than one valid value for the entry, nothing will happen.
Fill All Squares
You can automatically fill in all squares for which there is logically only one value at the moment. To do so, select
This feature should only be used to help you when you are very stuck on a difficult game. Using this feature on an easy game can solve the entire puzzle in one click, resulting in a very boring game!
You can turn on highlighting to automatically highlight the current row, column and box in different colors. This can make it easier to see which values cannot go into a current square. To toggle highlighting, you can:
Click
View
Highlighter

Highlighting makes it easy to scan rows, columns, and boxes.
You can use trackers to keep track of multiple moves at a time. Tracked moves will be entered in a different color to make them visually distinct. You can also delete all tracked moves at one time. This is particularly useful for solving difficult puzzles by trial-and-error.
Some sudoku players believe you should never use trial-and-error to solve a puzzle. These players should not use this feature.
You can toggle the tracker-interface by doing one of the following:
Tools
Track additions
Click
This will bring up a list of trackers on to the right of the current game. Create a new tracker by clicking
You can clear all the values that are part of a tracker by selecting the tracker from the list and clicking
Printing Sudoku
GNOME Sudoku can print games for you to play on paper. This is useful if you have to leave the computer but want to finish a game you have started, or if you want to print out a bunch of puzzles to do later.
To print the puzzle you are in the midst of playing, click
To print blank puzzles, select
You will then see a print dialog that lets you choose how many games you would like to print and how many games you want to print on each page (the more games you print per page, the smaller the games will be).
You can also select the range of difficulty you want the games to be in. The games will print in order of difficulty from easiest to hardest.
To create a 25 page mini sudoku book for yourself, you could select to print 100 sudokus, at 4 sudokus per page, with games ranging from easy to hard.
Printing a Mini-Sudoku book from
This will print 25 pages with 4 sudokus on each page.

Known Bugs and Limitations
Limited Puzzle Statistics
GNOME Sudoku ranks puzzles based on the number of squares that can be rapidly filled. The puzzle statistics box shows you the overall rating and shows you three pieces of information:
The number of squares fillable by elimination, starting from the blank grid (i.e. only a 2 can go in this box, so it must be a 2).
The number of squares fillable by filling, starting from the blank grid (i.e. only only one square in this row can be a 2, so it must be a 2).
The number of times in solving the puzzle that the computer had to use trial-and-error, or “guessing”, to solve the puzzle.
Many users are upset to know that the computer solver uses trial-and-error, especially since some Sudoku gurus say you should never guess to solve a puzzle. There are a number of other algorithms that can be implemented to help the computer solve sudoku, such as the swordfish and X-wings patterns.
