Using Sections
Sections are named blocks of text, including graphics or objects, that you can use in a number of ways:
To prevent text from being edited.
To show or hide text.
To reuse text and graphics from other $[officename] documents.
To insert sections of text that uses a different column layout than the current page style.
A section contains at least one paragraph.
When you select a text and create a section, a paragraph break is automatically inserted at the end of the text.
You can insert sections from a text document, or an entire text document as a section into another text document.
You can also insert sections from a text document as links in another text document, or in the same document.
Option
Alt
+Enter.
Sections and Columns
You can insert sections into an existing section.
For example, you can insert a section containing two columns into a section that contains one column.
A section layout, for example on the number of columns, has priority over the page layout defined in a page style.
