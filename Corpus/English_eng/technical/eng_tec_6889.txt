Proxies
Introduction
Proxies are programs running on a computer that acts a server on the network you are connected to (whether by modem or other means). These programs receive & HTTP; and & FTP; requests, retrieve the relevant files from the internet, and pass them on to the client computer that made the requests.
When you have configured a proxy, & HTTP; and/ or & FTP; requests are re-routed through the computer that is acting as a proxy server. However, you can also select specific hosts which should be contacted directly, rather than through the proxy server. If you are on a local network, for example, access to local hosts probably does n't need to go through a proxy server.
You should only need to configure a proxy server if your network administrator requires it (if you are a dial-up user, that would be your internet service provider or ISP). Otherwise, especially if you are feeling a bit confused about this proxy business, but everything seems to be fine with your internet connection, you do n't need to change anything.
Please note that using proxy servers is optional, but has the benefit or advantage of giving you faster access to data on the internet.
If you are uncertain whether or not you need to use a proxy server to connect to the internet, please consult with your internet service provider's setup guide or your system administrator.
Use
Connect to the Internet directly
Select this option if you do not want to use a proxy server.
If you have decided to use a proxy, you have several methods to configure the settings for it.
Automatically detect proxy configuration
Select this option if you want the proxy setup configuration script file to be automatically detected and downloaded.
This option only differs from the next choice in that it does not require you to supply the location of the configuration script file. Instead, it will be automatically downloaded using Web Access Protocol Discovery (WAPD).
If you have a problem using this setup, please consult the FAQ section at http: / /www. konqueror. org for more information.
Use proxy configuration URL
Select this option if your proxy support is provided through a script file located at a specific address. You can then enter the address in the location text box, or use the folder icon to browse to it.
Use preset proxy environment variables
Some systems are setup with $HTTP_PROXY to allow graphical as well as non-graphical applications to share the same proxy configuration information.
If you know this applies to you, select this option and click on the Setup... button to provide the environment variable names used to set the address of the proxy server(s).
Manually specify the proxy settings
Select this option, and click on the Setup... to manually setup the location of the proxy servers to be used.
If you choose this option, another dialog will pop up.
The complete addressing information for the proxy includes both the internet address and a port number. You should enter these into the relevant text boxes. The arrow button copies the information from the HTTP line to the FTP line, in order to help save some typing.
You can also choose Only use proxy for entries in this list.
Check this box to reverse the use of the exception list, & ie; the proxy servers will only be used when the requested & URL; matches one of the addresses listed here.
This features is useful if all you need is a proxy to access a few specific sites, for example, an internal intranet. If you have more complex requirements you might want to use a configuration script.
Authorization
Here you can choose between two types of authentication, if your proxy requires it. You can have Prompt as needed, the default, in which case & konqueror; will only ask for a username or password if it needs to.
The other option is to use automatic login. Select this option and enter Username and Password.
Options
Use persistent connections to proxy
Use persistent connection to your proxy server. Keeps connection to proxy open, helps lower bandwidth/ speed up connection. Enabling this option will require the proxy server's cooperation, if the proxy server does not support this, it will bring your internet to a stop.
KControl
Specified script file
If there are hosts which you can connect to without going through the proxy server, you can press Add to add the names of these hosts, separated by in the text box labeled No Proxy For:. For example, hosts that are on your local network can probably be contacted directly.
The other option is Use automatic login. Select this option if you have already set up a login entry for your proxy server in the $KDEDIR / share/ config/ kionetrc file.
