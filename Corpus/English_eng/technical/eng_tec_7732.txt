For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for solution for injection.
Xolair is an off-white lyophilised powder.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in adult and adolescent patients (12 years of age and above) with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who have reduced lung function (FEV1 < 80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist.
Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE mediated asthma (see section 4.2).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Use in adolescents and adults (12 years of age and older) Xolair treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe persistent asthma.
The appropriate dose and dosing frequency of Xolair is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ ml), measured before the start of treatment, and body weight (kg).
Prior to initial dosing, patients should have their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose assignment.
Based on these measurements 75-375 mg of Xolair in 1 to 3 injections may be needed for each administration.
Patients with IgE lower than 76 IU/ ml were less likely to experience benefit (see section 5.1).
Prescribing physicians should ensure that patients with IgE below 76 IU/ ml have unequivocal in vitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy.
See Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts.
Patients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dosing table should not be given Xolair.
The maximum recommended dose is 375 mg omalizumab every two weeks.
2 For subcutaneous administration only.
Do not administer by the intravenous or intramuscular route.
The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm.
Alternatively, the injections can be administered in the thigh if there is any reason precluding administration in the deltoid region.
There is limited experience with self-administration of Xolair.
Therefore treatment is intended to be administered by a healthcare provider.
For information on reconstitution of Xolair, see section 6.6.

recommendation
Treatment duration, monitoring and dose adjustments Discontinuation of Xolair treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and associated symptoms.
At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair therapy patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further injections are administered.
The decision to continue Xolair should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is seen (see section 5.1; Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness).
Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one year after the discontinuation of treatment.
Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during Xolair treatment cannot be used as a guide for dose determination.
Dose determination after treatment interruptions lasting less than one year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose determination.
Total serum IgE levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment with Xolair has been interrupted for one year or more.
Doses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3).
Elderly (65 years of age and older) There are limited data available on the use of Xolair in patients older than 65 years but there is no evidence that elderly patients require a different dosage from younger adult patients.
Children (age below 12 years) Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established and use of Xolair in such patients is therefore not recommended.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Xolair is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
Xolair has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those provoked by food allergy.
Xolair therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-mediated conditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment.
Caution should be exercised when administering Xolair in these patient populations.
Abrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of Xolair therapy is not recommended.
Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed under the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually.
Patients with diabetes mellitus, the glucose-galactose malabsorption syndrome, fructose intolerance or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency should be warned that one 75 mg Xolair dose contains 54 mg of sucrose.
Immune system disorders a.
Allergic reactions type I Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur when taking omalizumab, also with onset after a long duration of treatment.
Most of these reactions occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of Xolair but some started beyond 2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection.
Therefore medications for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should always be available for immediate use following administration of Xolair.
Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur.
Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials (see section 4.8).
As with all recombinant DNA derived humanised monoclonal antibodies, patients may in rare cases develop antibodies to omalizumab.
b.
Serum Sickness Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have rarely been seen in patients treated with humanized monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab.
The suggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to development of antibodies against omalizumab.
The onset has typically been 1-5 days after administration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment.
Symptoms suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/ arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and lymphadenopathy.
Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this disorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms.
5 c.
Churg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated with systemic corticosteroids.
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma agents, including omalizumab, may present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis.
These events are commonly associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy.
In these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/ or neuropathy.
Discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned immune system disorders.
Parasitic (helminth) infections IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections.
In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight increase in infection rate with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection were unaltered.
The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed to detect such infections, was less than 1 in 1,000 patients.
However, caution may be warranted in patients at high risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic infections are endemic.
If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, discontinuation of Xolair should be considered.
Malignancies During clinical trials, there was a numerical imbalance in cancers arising in the Xolair treatment group compared with the control group.
The frequency of observed cases was uncommon (< 1/ 100) in both the active and the control group, i. e.
25 cancers in 5,015 patients treated with Xolair (0.5%) and 5 cancers in 2,854 patients in the control group (0.18%).
The diversity in the type of cancers observed, the relatively short duration of exposure and the clinical features of the individual cases render a causal relationship unlikely.
The overall observed incidence rate of malignancy in the Xolair clinical trial programme was comparable to that reported in the general population.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions.
No formal medicinal product or vaccine interaction studies have been performed with Xolair.
There is no pharmacological reason to expect that commonly prescribed medications used in the treatment of asthma will interact with omalizumab.
In clinical studies Xolair was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, inhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral antihistamines.
There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered with these other commonly used asthma medications.
Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in combination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy).
Efficacy of Xolair treatment in combination with specific immunotherapy has not been established.
Current data suggest that no dose adjustments of Xolair are needed in patients on established hypo-sensitisation therapy.
6 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of omalizumab in pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Omalizumab crosses the placental barrier and the potential for harm to the foetus is unknown.
Omalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human primates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3).
Xolair should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
It is not known whether omalizumab is excreted in human breast milk.
Omalizumab is excreted into non-human primate breast milk and an effect on the suckling child cannot be excluded.
Nursing mothers should not breast-feed during Xolair therapy.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients receiving Xolair should be warned that if they experience dizziness, fatigue, faintness or drowsiness they should not drive or use machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
During clinical trials the most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, including injection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus, and headaches.
Most of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity.
Table 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total safety population treated with Xolair by system organ class and by frequency.
Frequencies are defined as: common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100) and rare (< 1/ 1,000).
Events reported in the post-marketing setting are listed with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Malignancies The overall observed incidence rate of malignancy in the Xolair clinical trial programme was comparable to that reported in the general population (see section 4.4).
Platelets In clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range.
None of these changes were associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in haemoglobin.
No pattern of persistent decrease in platelet counts, as observed in non-human primates (see section 5.3), has been reported in humans even though isolated cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenia have been reported in the post-marketing setting.
Parasitic infections In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight numerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant.
The course, severity, and response to treatment of infections was unaltered (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.
A maximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined.
Single intravenous doses up to 4,000 mg have been administered to patients without evidence of dose- limiting toxicities.
The highest cumulative dose administered to patients was 44,000 mg over a 20- week period and this dose did not result in any untoward acute effects.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other systemic drugs for obstructive airway diseases, ATC code:
R03DX05
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E (IgE).
The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework regions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE.
Omalizumab binds to IgE and prevents binding of IgE to the high-affinity FCε RI receptor, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the allergic cascade.
Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation of FCε RI receptors on basophils.
Furthermore, the in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from Xolair-treated subjects was reduced by approximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values.
8 In clinical studies, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses.
One year after discontinuation of Xolair dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no observed rebound in IgE levels after drug washout.
Clinical experience The efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-controlled study (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced lung function (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Eligible patients had experienced multiple asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended an emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Subcutaneous Xolair or placebo were administered as add-on therapy to > 1,000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or equivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene- modifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively).
The rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the primary endpoint.
Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153).
Further evaluations which did show statistical significance (p < 0.05) in favour of Xolair included reductions in severe exacerbations (where patient’ s lung function was reduced to below 60% of personal best and requiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised of hospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma symptoms and lung function.
In a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥ 76 IU/ ml were more likely to experience clinically meaningful benefit to Xolair.
In these patients in study 1 Xolair reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002).
In addition more patients had clinically meaningful responses in the total IgE ≥ 76 IU/ ml population across the Xolair severe asthma programme.
Table 5 includes results in the study 1 population.

Study 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in a population of 312 severe allergic asthmatics which matched the population in study 1.
Treatment with Xolair in this open label study led to a 61% reduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current asthma therapy alone.
Four additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults and adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in patients with severe persistent asthma.
Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less concomitant asthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2.
Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary endpoint, whereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing.
In studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with Xolair had respective reductions in asthma exacerbation rates of 37.5% (p=0.027), 40.3% (p < 0.001) and 57.6% (p < 0.001) compared to placebo.
In study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on Xolair were able to reduce their fluticasone dose to ≤ 500 micrograms/ day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to the placebo group (45.8%, p < 0.05).
Quality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire.
For all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life scores for Xolair patients versus the placebo or control group.
Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness:
Physician’ s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of asthma control performed by the treating physician.
The physician was able to take into account PEF, day and night time symptoms, rescue medication use, spirometry and exacerbations.
In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of Xolair treated patients were judged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma compared to placebo patients.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in patients with allergic asthma.
Absorption After subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability of 62%.
Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, omalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 7-8 days.
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/ kg.
Following multiple doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose.
Distribution In vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE.
Precipitating complexes and complexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo.
The apparent volume of distribution in patients following subcutaneous administration was 78 ± 32 ml/ kg.
10 Elimination Clearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE.
Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells.
Intact IgG is also excreted in bile.
In asthma patients the omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging 2.4 ± 1.1 ml/ kg/ day.
In addition, doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance.
Characteristics in patient populations Age, Race/ Ethnicity, Gender The population pharmacokinetics of Xolair were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic characteristics.
Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age (12-76 years), race, ethnicity or gender.
Renal and hepatic impairment There are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.4).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to cynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity.
Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some monkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration.
However, no apparent toxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen.
There was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus monkeys.
Chronic administration of omalizumab was well tolerated in non-human primates, with the exception of a dose-related and age-dependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals.
The serum concentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys was roughly 4 to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations.
In addition, acute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys.
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab.
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/ kg (about 12-fold exposure ratio based on 28-day AUC values at 75 mg/ kg versus the clinical maximum dose) did not elicit maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not elicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, delivery and nursing.
Omalizumb is excreted in milk in cynomolgus monkeys.
Milk levels of omalizumab were 1.5% of the maternal blood concentration.

6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
The lyophilised product takes 15-20 minutes to dissolve, although in some cases it may take longer.
The fully reconstituted product will appear clear or slightly opaque and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial.
Because of the viscosity of the reconstituted product care must be taken to WITHDRAW ALL OF THE PRODUCT from the vial before expelling any air or excess solution from the syringe in order to obtain the 0.6 ml.
12 To prepare Xolair 75 mg vials for subcutaneous administration, please adhere to the following instructions:
1.
Draw 0.9 ml of water for injections from the ampoule into a syringe equipped with a large-bore 18-gauge needle.
2.
With the vial placed upright on a flat surface, insert the needle and transfer the water for injections into the vial containing the lyophilised powder using standard aseptic techniques, directing the water for injections directly onto the powder.
3.
Keeping the vial in an upright position, vigorously swirl it (do not shake) for approximately 1 minute to evenly wet the powder.
4.
To aid in dissolution after completing step 3, gently swirl the vial for 5-10 seconds approximately every 5 minutes in order to dissolve any remaining solids.
Note that in some cases it may take longer than 20 minutes for the powder to dissolve completely.
If this is the case, repeat step 4 until there are no visible gel-like particles in the solution.
When the product is fully dissolved, there should be no visible gel-like particles in the solution.
Small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial are common.
The reconstituted product will appear clear or slightly opaque.
Do not use if solid particles are present.
5.
Invert the vial for at least 15 seconds in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper.
Using a new 3-ml syringe equipped with a large-bore, 18-gauge needle, insert the needle into the inverted vial.
Keeping the vial inverted position the needle tip at the very bottom of the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe.
Before removing the needle from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove all of the solution from the inverted vial.
6.
Replace the 18-gauge needle with a 25-gauge needle for subcutaneous injection.
7.
Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required 0.6 ml dose.
A thin layer of small bubbles may remain at the top of the solution in the syringe.
Because the solution is slightly viscous, it may take take 5-10 seconds to administer the solution by subcutaneous injection.
The vial delivers 0.6 ml (75 mg) of Xolair.
8.
The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm or the thigh.
Xolair 75 mg powder for solution for injection is supplied in a single-use vial and contains no antibacterial preservatives.
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after reconstitution (see section 6.3).
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in adult and adolescent patients (12 years of age and above) with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who have reduced lung function (FEV1 < 80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist.
Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE mediated asthma (see section 4.2).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Use in adolescents and adults (12 years of age and older) Xolair treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe persistent asthma.
The appropriate dose and dosing frequency of Xolair is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ ml), measured before the start of treatment, and body weight (kg).
Prior to initial dosing, patients should have their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose assignment.
Based on these measurements 75-375 mg of Xolair in 1 to 3 injections may be needed for each administration.
Patients with IgE lower than 76 IU/ ml were less likely to experience benefit (see section 5.1).
Prescribing physicians should ensure that patients with IgE below 76 IU/ ml have unequivocal in vitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy.
See Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts.
Patients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dosing table should not be given Xolair.
The maximum recommended dose is 375 mg omalizumab every two weeks.
15 For subcutaneous administration only.
Do not administer by the intravenous or intramuscular route.
The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm.
Alternatively, the injections can be administered in the thigh if there is any reason precluding administration in the deltoid region.
There is limited experience with self-administration of Xolair.
Therefore treatment is intended to be administered by a healthcare provider.
For information on reconstitution of Xolair, see section 6.6.

recommendation
Treatment duration, monitoring and dose adjustments Discontinuation of Xolair treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and associated symptoms.
At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair therapy patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further injections are administered.
The decision to continue Xolair should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is seen (see section 5.1; Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness).
Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one year after the discontinuation of treatment.
Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during Xolair treatment cannot be used as a guide for dose determination.
Dose determination after treatment interruptions lasting less than one year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose determination.
Total serum IgE levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment with Xolair has been interrupted for one year or more.
Doses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3).
Elderly (65 years of age and older) There are limited data available on the use of Xolair in patients older than 65 years but there is no evidence that elderly patients require a different dosage from younger adult patients.
Children (age below 12 years) Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established and use of Xolair in such patients is therefore not recommended.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
17 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Xolair is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
Xolair has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those provoked by food allergy.
Xolair therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-mediated conditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment.
Caution should be exercised when administering Xolair in these patient populations.
Abrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of Xolair therapy is not recommended.
Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed under the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually.
Patients with diabetes mellitus, the glucose-galactose malabsorption syndrome, fructose intolerance or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency should be warned that one 150 mg Xolair dose contains 108 mg of sucrose.
Immune system disorders a.
Allergic reactions type I Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur when taking omalizumab, also with onset after a long duration of treatment.
Most of these reactions occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of Xolair but some started beyond 2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection.
Therefore medications for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should always be available for immediate use following administration of Xolair.
Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur.
Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials (see section 4.8).
As with all recombinant DNA derived humanised monoclonal antibodies, patients may in rare cases develop antibodies to omalizumab.
b.
Serum Sickness Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have rarely been seen in patients treated with humanized monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab.
The suggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to development of antibodies against omalizumab.
The onset has typically been 1-5 days after administration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment.
Symptoms suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/ arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and lymphadenopathy.
Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this disorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms.
18 c.
Churg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated with systemic corticosteroids.
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma agents, including omalizumab, may present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis.
These events are commonly associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy.
In these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/ or neuropathy.
Discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned immune system disorders.
Parasitic (helminth) infections IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections.
In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight increase in infection rate with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection were unaltered.
The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed to detect such infections, was less than 1 in 1,000 patients.
However, caution may be warranted in patients at high risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic infections are endemic.
If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, discontinuation of Xolair should be considered.
Malignancies During clinical trials, there was a numerical imbalance in cancers arising in the Xolair treatment group compared with the control group.
The frequency of observed cases was uncommon (< 1/ 100) in both the active and the control group, i. e.
25 cancers in 5,015 patients treated with Xolair (0.5%) and 5 cancers in 2,854 patients in the control group (0.18%).
The diversity in the type of cancers observed, the relatively short duration of exposure and the clinical features of the individual cases render a causal relationship unlikely.
The overall observed incidence rate of malignancy in the Xolair clinical trial programme was comparable to that reported in the general population.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions.
No formal medicinal product or vaccine interaction studies have been performed with Xolair.
There is no pharmacological reason to expect that commonly prescribed medications used in the treatment of asthma will interact with omalizumab.
In clinical studies Xolair was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, inhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral antihistamines.
There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered with these other commonly used asthma medications.
Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in combination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy).
Efficacy of Xolair treatment in combination with specific immunotherapy has not been established.
Current data suggest that no dose adjustments of Xolair are needed in patients on established hypo-sensitisation therapy.
19 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of omalizumab in pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Omalizumab crosses the placental barrier and the potential for harm to the foetus is unknown.
Omalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human primates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3).
Xolair should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
It is not known whether omalizumab is excreted in human breast milk.
Omalizumab is excreted into non-human primate breast milk and an effect on the suckling child cannot be excluded.
Nursing mothers should not breast-feed during Xolair therapy.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients receiving Xolair should be warned that if they experience dizziness, fatigue, faintness or drowsiness they should not drive or use machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
During clinical trials the most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, including injection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus, and headaches.
Most of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity.
Table 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total safety population treated with Xolair by system organ class and by frequency.
Frequencies are defined as: common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100) and rare (< 1/ 1,000).
Events reported in the post-marketing setting are listed with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Malignancies The overall observed incidence rate of malignancy in the Xolair clinical trial programme was comparable to that reported in the general population (see section 4.4).
Platelets In clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range.
None of these changes were associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in haemoglobin.
No pattern of persistent decrease in platelet counts, as observed in non-human primates (see section 5.3), has been reported in humans even though isolated cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenia have been reported in the post-marketing setting.
Parasitic infections In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight numerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant.
The course, severity, and response to treatment of infections was unaltered (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.
A maximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined.
Single intravenous doses up to 4,000 mg have been administered to patients without evidence of dose- limiting toxicities.
The highest cumulative dose administered to patients was 44,000 mg over a 20- week period and this dose did not result in any untoward acute effects.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other systemic drugs for obstructive airway diseases, ATC code:
R03DX05
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E (IgE).
The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework regions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE.
Omalizumab binds to IgE and prevents binding of IgE to the high-affinity FCε RI receptor, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the allergic cascade.
Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation of FCε RI receptors on basophils.
Furthermore, the in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from Xolair-treated subjects was reduced by approximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values.
21 In clinical studies, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses.
One year after discontinuation of Xolair dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no observed rebound in IgE levels after drug washout.
Clinical experience The efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-controlled study (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced lung function (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Eligible patients had experienced multiple asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended an emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Subcutaneous Xolair or placebo were administered as add-on therapy to > 1,000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or equivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene- modifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively).
The rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the primary endpoint.
Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153).
Further evaluations which did show statistical significance (p < 0.05) in favour of Xolair included reductions in severe exacerbations (where patient’ s lung function was reduced to below 60% of personal best and requiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised of hospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma symptoms and lung function.
In a subgroup analysis patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥ 76 IU/ ml were more likely to experience clinically meaningful benefit to Xolair.
In these patients in study 1 Xolair reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002).
In addition more patients had clinically meaningful responses in the total IgE ≥ 76 IU/ ml population across the Xolair severe asthma programme.
Table 5 includes results in the study 1 population.

Study 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in a population of 312 severe allergic asthmatics which matched the population in study 1.
Treatment with Xolair in this open label study led to a 61% reduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current asthma therapy alone.
Four additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults and adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in patients with severe persistent asthma.
Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less concomitant asthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2.
Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary endpoint, whereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing.
In studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with Xolair had respective reductions in asthma exacerbation rates of 37.5% (p=0.027), 40.3% (p < 0.001) and 57.6% (p < 0.001) compared to placebo.
In study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on Xolair were able to reduce their fluticasone dose to ≤ 500 micrograms/ day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to the placebo group (45.8%, p < 0.05).
Quality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire.
For all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life scores for Xolair patients versus the placebo or control group.
Physicians overall assessment of treatment effectiveness:
Physician’ s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of asthma control performed by the treating physician.
The physician was able to take into account PEF, day and night time symptoms, rescue medication use, spirometry and exacerbations.
In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of Xolair treated patients were judged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma compared to placebo patients.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in patients with allergic asthma.
Absorption After subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability of 62%.
Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, omalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 7-8 days.
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/ kg.
Following multiple doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose.
Distribution In vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE.
Precipitating complexes and complexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo.
The apparent volume of distribution in patients following subcutaneous administration was 78 ± 32 ml/ kg.
23 Elimination Clearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE.
Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells.
Intact IgG is also excreted in bile.
In asthma patients the omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging 2.4 ± 1.1 ml/ kg/ day.
In addition, doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance.
Characteristics in patient populations Age, Race/ Ethnicity, Gender The population pharmacokinetics of Xolair were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic characteristics.
Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age (12-76 years), race, ethnicity or gender.
Renal and hepatic impairment There are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.4).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to cynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity.
Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some monkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration.
However, no apparent toxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen.
There was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus monkeys.
Chronic administration of omalizumab was well tolerated in non-human primates, with the exception of a dose-related and age-dependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals.
The serum concentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys was roughly 4 to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations.
In addition, acute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys.
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab.
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/ kg (about 12-fold exposure ratio based on 28-day AUC values at 75 mg/ kg versus the clinical maximum dose) did not elicit maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not elicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, delivery and nursing.
Omalizumb is excreted in milk in cynomolgus monkeys.
Milk levels of omalizumab were 1.5% of the maternal blood concentration.

Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
The lyophilised product takes 15-20 minutes to dissolve, although in some cases it may take longer.
The fully reconstituted product will appear clear or slightly opaque and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial.
Because of the viscosity of the reconstituted product care must be taken to WITHDRAW ALL OF THE PRODUCT from the vial before expelling any air or excess solution from the syringe in order to obtain the 1.2 ml.
25 To prepare Xolair 150 mg vials for subcutaneous administration, please adhere to the following instructions:
1.
Draw 1.4 ml of water for injections from the ampoule into a syringe equipped with a large-bore 18-gauge needle.
2.
With the vial placed upright on a flat surface, insert the needle and transfer the water for injections into the vial containing the lyophilised powder using standard aseptic techniques, directing the water for injections directly onto the powder.
3.
Keeping the vial in an upright position, vigorously swirl it (do not shake) for approximately 1 minute to evenly wet the powder.
4.
To aid in dissolution after completing step 3, gently swirl the vial for 5-10 seconds approximately every 5 minutes in order to dissolve any remaining solids.
Note that in some cases it may take longer than 20 minutes for the powder to dissolve completely.
If this is the case, repeat step 4 until there are no visible gel-like particles in the solution.
When the product is fully dissolved, there should be no visible gel-like particles in the solution.
Small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial are common.
The reconstituted product will appear clear or slightly opaque.
Do not use if solid particles are present.
5.
Invert the vial for at least 15 seconds in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper.
Using a new 3-ml syringe equipped with a large-bore, 18-gauge needle, insert the needle into the inverted vial.
Keeping the vial inverted position the needle tip at the very bottom of the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe.
Before removing the needle from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove all of the solution from the inverted vial.
6.
Replace the 18-gauge needle with a 25-gauge needle for subcutaneous injection.
7.
Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required 1.2 ml dose.
A thin layer of small bubbles may remain at the top of the solution in the syringe.
Because the solution is slightly viscous, it may take 5-10 seconds to administer the solution by subcutaneous injection.
The vial delivers 1.2 ml (150 mg) of Xolair.
For a 75 mg dose, draw up 0.6 ml into the syringe and discard the remaining solution.
8.
The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm or the thigh.
Xolair 150 mg powder for solution for injection is supplied in a single-use vial and contains no antibacterial preservatives.
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately after reconstitution (see section 6.3).
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in adult and adolescent patients (12 years of age and above) with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who have reduced lung function (FEV1 < 80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist.
Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) mediated asthma (see section 4.2).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Xolair treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe persistent asthma.
Use in adolescents and adults (12 years of age and older) The appropriate dose and dosing frequency of Xolair is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ ml), measured before the start of treatment, and body weight (kg).
Prior to initial dosing, patients should have their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose assignment.
Based on these measurements 75-375 mg of Xolair in 1 to 3 injections may be needed for each administration.
Patients with IgE lower than 76 IU/ ml were less likely to experience benefit (see section 5.1).
Prescribing physicians should ensure that patients with IgE below 76 IU/ ml have unequivocal in vitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy.
See Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts.
Patients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dosing table should not be given Xolair.
28 The maximum recommended dose is 375 mg omalizumab every two weeks.

recommendation
For subcutaneous administration only.
Do not administer by the intravenous or intramuscular route.
The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm.
Alternatively, the injections can be administered in the thigh if there is any reason precluding administration in the deltoid region.
There is limited experience with self-administration of Xolair.
Therefore treatment is intended to be administered by a healthcare provider (see section 6.6).
Treatment duration, monitoring and dose adjustments Discontinuation of Xolair treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and associated symptoms.
At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair therapy patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further injections are administered.
The decision to continue Xolair should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is seen (see section 5.1; Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness).
Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one year after the discontinuation of treatment.
Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during Xolair treatment cannot be used as a guide for dose determination.
Dose determination after treatment interruptions lasting less than one year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose determination.
Total serum IgE levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment with Xolair has been interrupted for one year or more.
Doses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3).
Elderly (65 years of age and older) There are limited data available on the use of Xolair in patients older than 65 years but there is no evidence that elderly patients require a different dosage from younger adult patients.
30 Children (age below 12 years) Xolair is not recommended for use in children below age 12 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment There have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of Xolair.
Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular endothelial system (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment.
While no particular dose adjustment is recommended for these patients, Xolair should be administered with caution (see section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Xolair is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
Xolair has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those provoked by food allergy.
Xolair is not indicated for the treatment of these conditions.
Xolair therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-mediated conditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment.
Caution should be exercised when administering Xolair in these patient populations.
Abrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of Xolair therapy is not recommended.
Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed under the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually.
Immune system disorders • Allergic reactions type I Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur when taking omalizumab, also with onset after a long duration of treatment.
Most of these reactions occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of Xolair but some started beyond 2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection.
Therefore medicinal products for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should always be available for immediate use following administration of Xolair.
Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur.
Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials (see section 4.8).
As with all recombinant DNA derived humanised monoclonal antibodies, patients may in rare cases develop antibodies to omalizumab.
• Serum Sickness Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have rarely been seen in patients treated with humanized monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab.
The suggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to development of antibodies against omalizumab.
The onset has typically been 1-5 days after administration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment.
Symptoms suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/ arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and
31 lymphadenopathy.
Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this disorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms.
• Churg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated with systemic corticosteroids.
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma agents, including omalizumab, may present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis.
These events are commonly associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy.
In these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/ or neuropathy.
Discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned immune system disorders.
Parasitic (helminth) infections IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections.
In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight increase in infection rate with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection were unaltered.
The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed to detect such infections, was less than 1 in 1,000 patients.
However, caution may be warranted in patients at high risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic infections are endemic.
If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, discontinuation of Xolair should be considered.
Malignancies During clinical trials, there was a numerical imbalance in cancers arising in the Xolair (0.5%; 25 cancers in 5,015 patients) treatment group compared with the control (0.18%; 5 cancers in 2,854 patients) group.
Malignancies were uncommon (< 1/ 100) in both the active and the control group.
The diversity in the type of cancers observed, the relatively short duration of exposure and the clinical features of the individual cases render a causal relationship unlikely.
The overall observed incidence rate of malignancy in the Xolair clinical trial programme was comparable to that reported in the general population.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions.
Medicinal product or vaccine interaction studies have not been performed with Xolair.
There is no pharmacological reason to expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma will interact with omalizumab.
In clinical studies Xolair was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, inhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral antihistamines.
There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered with these other commonly used asthma medications.
Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in combination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy).
32 Xolair may indirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other parasitic infections (see section 4.4).
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of omalizumab in pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Omalizumab crosses the placental barrier and the potential for harm to the foetus is unknown.
Omalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human primates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3).
Xolair should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
It is not known whether omalizumab is excreted in human breast milk.
Omalizumab is excreted into non-human primate breast milk and risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded.
Breast-feeding women should not breast-feed during Xolair therapy.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients receiving Xolair should be warned that if they experience dizziness, fatigue, faintness or drowsiness they should not drive or use machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Over 4,400 allergic asthma patients were randomised in controlled efficacy trials with Xolair.
Based on clinical experience, about 16% of patients treated with Xolair are expected to experience adverse events.
During clinical trials the most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, including injection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus, and headaches.
Most of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity.
Table 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total safety population treated with Xolair by system organ class and by frequency.
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Frequencies are defined as: common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100) and rare (< 1/ 1,000).
Events reported in the post-marketing setting are listed with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

For further information, see section 4.4.
Malignancies The overall observed incidence rate of malignancy in the Xolair clinical trial programme was comparable to that reported in the general population (see section 4.4).
Platelets In clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range.
None of these changes were associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in haemoglobin.
No pattern of persistent decrease in platelet counts, as observed in non-human primates (see section 5.3), has been reported in humans even though isolated cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenia have been reported in the post-marketing setting.
Parasitic infections In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight numerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant.
The course, severity, and response to treatment of infections was unaltered (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.
A maximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined.
Single intravenous doses up to 4,000 mg have been administered to patients without evidence of dose- limiting toxicities.
The highest cumulative dose administered to patients was 44,000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not result in any untoward acute effects.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other systemic drugs for obstructive airway diseases, ATC code:
R03DX05
34 Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E (IgE).
The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework regions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE.
Omalizumab binds to IgE and prevents binding of IgE to FCε RI (high-affinity IgE receptor), thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the allergic cascade.
Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation of FCε RI receptors on basophils.
Furthermore, the in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from Xolair-treated subjects was reduced by approximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values.
In clinical studies, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses.
One year after discontinuation of Xolair dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no observed rebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product.
Clinical experience The efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-controlled study (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced lung function (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Eligible patients had experienced multiple asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended an emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Subcutaneous Xolair or placebo were administered as add-on therapy to > 1,000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or equivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene- modifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively).
The rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the primary endpoint.
Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153).
Further evaluations which did show statistical significance (p < 0.05) in favour of Xolair included reductions in severe exacerbations (where patient’ s lung function was reduced to below 60% of personal best and requiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised of hospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma symptoms and lung function.
In a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥ 76 IU/ ml were more likely to experience clinically meaningful benefit to Xolair.
In these patients in study 1 Xolair reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002).
In addition more patients had clinically meaningful responses in the total IgE ≥ 76 IU/ ml population across the Xolair severe asthma programme.
Table 5 includes results in the study 1 population.

Study 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in a population of 312 severe allergic asthmatics which matched the population in study 1.
Treatment with Xolair in this open label study led to a 61% reduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current asthma therapy alone.
Four additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults and adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in patients with severe persistent asthma.
Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less concomitant asthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2.
Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary endpoint, whereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing.
In studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with Xolair had respective reductions in asthma exacerbation rates of 37.5% (p=0.027), 40.3% (p < 0.001) and 57.6% (p < 0.001) compared to placebo.
In study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on Xolair were able to reduce their fluticasone dose to ≤ 500 micrograms/ day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to the placebo group (45.8%, p < 0.05).
Quality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire.
For all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life scores for Xolair patients versus the placebo or control group.
Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness:
Physician’ s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of asthma control performed by the treating physician.
The physician was able to take into account PEF (peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medication use, spirometry and exacerbations.
In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of Xolair treated patients were judged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma compared to placebo patients.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in patients with allergic asthma.
Absorption After subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability of 62%.
Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, omalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 7-8 days.
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/ kg.
Following multiple
36 doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose.
Distribution In vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE.
Precipitating complexes and complexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo.
The apparent volume of distribution in patients following subcutaneous administration was 78 ± 32 ml/ kg.
Elimination Clearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE.
Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells.
Intact IgG is also excreted in bile.
In asthma patients the omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging 2.4 ± 1.1 ml/ kg/ day.
In addition, doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance.
Characteristics in patient populations Age, Race/ Ethnicity, Gender The population pharmacokinetics of Xolair were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic characteristics.
Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age (12-76 years), race, ethnicity or gender (see section 4.2).
Renal and hepatic impairment There are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to cynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity.
Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some monkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration.
However, no apparent toxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen.
There was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus monkeys.
Chronic administration of high dose levels (up to 250 mg/ kg) of omalizumab did not induce toxicologically-significant adverse reactions in non-human primates, with the exception of a dose- related and age-dependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals.
The serum concentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys was roughly 4 to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations.
In addition, acute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys.
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab.
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/ kg (about 12-fold exposure ratio based on 28-day AUC values at 75 mg/ kg versus the clinical maximum dose) did not elicit maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not elicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, delivery and nursing.
Omalizumb is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys.
Milk levels of omalizumab were 1.5% of the maternal blood concentration.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in adult and adolescent patients (12 years of age and above) with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who have reduced lung function (FEV1 < 80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist.
Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) mediated asthma (see section 4.2).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Xolair treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe persistent asthma.
Use in adolescents and adults (12 years of age and older) The appropriate dose and dosing frequency of Xolair is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ ml), measured before the start of treatment, and body weight (kg).
Prior to initial dosing, patients should have their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose assignment.
Based on these measurements 75-375 mg of Xolair in 1 to 3 injections may be needed for each administration.
Patients with IgE lower than 76 IU/ ml were less likely to experience benefit (see section 5.1).
Prescribing physicians should ensure that patients with IgE below 76 IU/ ml have unequivocal in vitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy.
See Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts.
Patients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dosing table should not be given Xolair.
40 The maximum recommended dose is 375 mg omalizumab every two weeks.

recommendation
For subcutaneous administration only.
Do not administer by the intravenous or intramuscular route.
The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm.
Alternatively, the injections can be administered in the thigh if there is any reason precluding administration in the deltoid region.
There is limited experience with self-administration of Xolair.
Therefore treatment is intended to be administered by a healthcare provider (see section 6.6).
Treatment duration, monitoring and dose adjustments Discontinuation of Xolair treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and associated symptoms.
At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair therapy patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further injections are administered.
The decision to continue Xolair should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is seen (see section 5.1; Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness).
Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one year after the discontinuation of treatment.
Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during Xolair treatment cannot be used as a guide for dose determination.
Dose determination after treatment interruptions lasting less than one year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose determination.
Total serum IgE levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment with Xolair has been interrupted for one year or more.
Doses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3).
Elderly (65 years of age and older) There are limited data available on the use of Xolair in patients older than 65 years but there is no evidence that elderly patients require a different dosage from younger adult patients.
42 Children (age below 12 years) Xolair is not recommended for use in children below age 12 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment There have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of Xolair.
Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular endothelial system (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment.
While no particular dose adjustment is recommended for these patients, Xolair should be administered with caution (see section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General Xolair is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
Xolair has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those provoked by food allergy.
Xolair is not indicated for the treatment of these conditions.
Xolair therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-mediated conditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment.
Caution should be exercised when administering Xolair in these patient populations.
Abrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of Xolair therapy is not recommended.
Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed under the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually.
Immune system disorders • Allergic reactions type I Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur when taking omalizumab, also with onset after a long duration of treatment.
Most of these reactions occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of Xolair but some started beyond 2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection.
Therefore medicinal products for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should always be available for immediate use following administration of Xolair.
Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible and prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur.
Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials (see section 4.8).
As with all recombinant DNA derived humanised monoclonal antibodies, patients may in rare cases develop antibodies to omalizumab.
• Serum Sickness Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have rarely been seen in patients treated with humanized monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab.
The suggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to development of antibodies against omalizumab.
The onset has typically been 1-5 days after administration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment.
Symptoms suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/ arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and
43 lymphadenopathy.
Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this disorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms.
• Churg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated with systemic corticosteroids.
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma agents, including omalizumab, may present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis.
These events are commonly associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy.
In these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/ or neuropathy.
Discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned immune system disorders.
Parasitic (helminth) infections IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections.
In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight increase in infection rate with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection were unaltered.
The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed to detect such infections, was less than 1 in 1,000 patients.
However, caution may be warranted in patients at high risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic infections are endemic.
If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, discontinuation of Xolair should be considered.
Malignancies During clinical trials, there was a numerical imbalance in cancers arising in the Xolair (0.5%; 25 cancers in 5,015 patients) treatment group compared with the control (0.18%; 5 cancers in 2,854 patients) group.
Malignancies were uncommon (< 1/ 100) in both the active and the control group.
The diversity in the type of cancers observed, the relatively short duration of exposure and the clinical features of the individual cases render a causal relationship unlikely.
The overall observed incidence rate of malignancy in the Xolair clinical trial programme was comparable to that reported in the general population.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions.
Medicinal product or vaccine interaction studies have not been performed with Xolair.
There is no pharmacological reason to expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma will interact with omalizumab.
In clinical studies Xolair was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, inhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral antihistamines.
There was no indication that the safety of Xolair was altered with these other commonly used asthma medications.
Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in combination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy).
44 Xolair may indirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other parasitic infections (see section 4.4).
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of omalizumab in pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).
Omalizumab crosses the placental barrier and the potential for harm to the foetus is unknown.
Omalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human primates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3).
Xolair should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
It is not known whether omalizumab is excreted in human breast milk.
Omalizumab is excreted into non-human primate breast milk and risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded.
Breast-feeding women should not breast-feed during Xolair therapy.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Patients receiving Xolair should be warned that if they experience dizziness, fatigue, faintness or drowsiness they should not drive or use machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Over 4,400 allergic asthma patients were randomised in controlled efficacy trials with Xolair.
Based on clinical experience, about 16% of patients treated with Xolair are expected to experience adverse events.
During clinical trials the most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions, including injection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus, and headaches.
Most of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity.
Table 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total safety population treated with Xolair by system organ class and by frequency.
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Frequencies are defined as: common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100) and rare (< 1/ 1,000).
Events reported in the post-marketing setting are listed with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

For further information, see section 4.4.
Malignancies The overall observed incidence rate of malignancy in the Xolair clinical trial programme was comparable to that reported in the general population (see section 4.4).
Platelets In clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range.
None of these changes were associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in haemoglobin.
No pattern of persistent decrease in platelet counts, as observed in non-human primates (see section 5.3), has been reported in humans even though isolated cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenia have been reported in the post-marketing setting.
Parasitic infections In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight numerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant.
The course, severity, and response to treatment of infections was unaltered (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.
A maximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined.
Single intravenous doses up to 4,000 mg have been administered to patients without evidence of dose- limiting toxicities.
The highest cumulative dose administered to patients was 44,000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not result in any untoward acute effects.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other systemic drugs for obstructive airway diseases, ATC code:
R03DX05
46 Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E (IgE).
The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework regions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE.
Omalizumab binds to IgE and prevents binding of IgE to FCε RI (high-affinity IgE receptor), thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the allergic cascade.
Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation of FCε RI receptors on basophils.
Furthermore, the in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from Xolair-treated subjects was reduced by approximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values.
In clinical studies, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses.
One year after discontinuation of Xolair dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no observed rebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product.
Clinical experience The efficacy and safety of Xolair were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-controlled study (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced lung function (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Eligible patients had experienced multiple asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended an emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Subcutaneous Xolair or placebo were administered as add-on therapy to > 1,000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or equivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist.
Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene- modifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively).
The rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the primary endpoint.
Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153).
Further evaluations which did show statistical significance (p < 0.05) in favour of Xolair included reductions in severe exacerbations (where patient’ s lung function was reduced to below 60% of personal best and requiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised of hospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma symptoms and lung function.
In a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥ 76 IU/ ml were more likely to experience clinically meaningful benefit to Xolair.
In these patients in study 1 Xolair reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002).
In addition more patients had clinically meaningful responses in the total IgE ≥ 76 IU/ ml population across the Xolair severe asthma programme.
Table 5 includes results in the study 1 population.

Study 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in a population of 312 severe allergic asthmatics which matched the population in study 1.
Treatment with Xolair in this open label study led to a 61% reduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current asthma therapy alone.
Four additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults and adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of Xolair in patients with severe persistent asthma.
Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less concomitant asthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2.
Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary endpoint, whereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing.
In studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with Xolair had respective reductions in asthma exacerbation rates of 37.5% (p=0.027), 40.3% (p < 0.001) and 57.6% (p < 0.001) compared to placebo.
In study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on Xolair were able to reduce their fluticasone dose to ≤ 500 micrograms/ day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to the placebo group (45.8%, p < 0.05).
Quality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire.
For all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life scores for Xolair patients versus the placebo or control group.
Physician’ s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness:
Physician’ s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of asthma control performed by the treating physician.
The physician was able to take into account PEF (peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medication use, spirometry and exacerbations.
In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of Xolair treated patients were judged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma compared to placebo patients.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in patients with allergic asthma.
Absorption After subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability of 62%.
Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, omalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 7-8 days.
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/ kg.
Following multiple
48 doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose.
Distribution In vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE.
Precipitating complexes and complexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo.
The apparent volume of distribution in patients following subcutaneous administration was 78 ± 32 ml/ kg.
Elimination Clearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE.
Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells.
Intact IgG is also excreted in bile.
In asthma patients the omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging 2.4 ± 1.1 ml/ kg/ day.
In addition, doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance.
Characteristics in patient populations Age, Race/ Ethnicity, Gender The population pharmacokinetics of Xolair were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic characteristics.
Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age (12-76 years), race, ethnicity or gender (see section 4.2).
Renal and hepatic impairment There are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to cynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity.
Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some monkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration.
However, no apparent toxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen.
There was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus monkeys.
Chronic administration of high dose levels (up to 250 mg/ kg) of omalizumab did not induce toxicologically-significant adverse reactions in non-human primates, with the exception of a dose- related and age-dependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals.
The serum concentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys was roughly 4 to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations.
In addition, acute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys.
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab.
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/ kg (about 12-fold exposure ratio based on 28-day AUC values at 75 mg/ kg versus the clinical maximum dose) did not elicit maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not elicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, delivery and nursing.
Omalizumb is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys.
Milk levels of omalizumab were 1.5% of the maternal blood concentration.

Further information
1.
WHAT XOLAIR IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Xolair is used to prevent asthma getting worse and to control asthma symptoms when given in addition to other asthma medication.
Xolair is used to control symptoms of severe allergic asthma in adults or adolescents (12 years of age and older) whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by high-dose steroid inhalers or beta- agonist inhalers.
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body.
IgE plays a key role in causing allergic asthma.
Your doctor will measure the amount of IgE in your blood before giving you Xolair injections.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE XOLAIR
Do not use Xolair
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of Xolair.
The
ingredients are listed in section 6 of this leaflet.
Talk to your doctor before you have an injection.
Take special care with Xolair Do not use Xolair to treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack.
You will have been given a separate medicine for this.
Watch out for allergic reactions to Xolair.
Xolair contains a protein, and proteins can cause serious allergic reactions in some people.
Signs include rash, difficulty in breathing, swelling or feeling faint.
If you have an allergic reaction after taking Xolair, contact a doctor as soon as you can.
Do not use Xolair to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as:
- sudden allergic reactions
- hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder)
- aspergillosis (a fungus-related lung disease)
- food allergy, allergic skin rash or hay fever.
86 Xolair will not harm you but you may need other medicines to treat these conditions.
Xolair in children Do not give Xolair to children under 12 years of age.
Not enough is known about its effect on younger children.
Xolair and older people Xolair may be given to people aged 65 years and over.
There is no evidence to suggest that any special precautions are needed when older people are treated, although experience is still limited.
Patients with kidney or liver problems If you have kidney or liver problems, please talk to your doctor about using Xolair.
Parasite infections If you are living in a region where parasite infections are frequent or travelling to such a region, please tell your doctor.
Xolair may weaken your resistance to such infections.
If you are taking a treatment against parasite infection, please tell your doctor.
Xolair may reduce the efficacy of your treatment.
Taking other medicines Xolair can be used together with inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma, but it is still important to tell your doctor that you are taking them before you are given Xolair.
You will need to carry on taking your current asthma medicine during Xolair treatment.
Do not stop taking any asthma medications without talking to your doctor.
If you are taking a treatment against parasite infection, please tell your doctor.
Xolair may reduce the efficacy of your treatment.
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, tell your doctor before starting treatment with Xolair.
Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of being given this medicine during pregnancy.
If you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor straight away.
If you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed, get advice from your doctor before taking Xolair.
Xolair may be passed in your breast milk to your baby.
Driving and using machines Xolair can make some people feel dizzy, sleepy or faint, although this is uncommon.
Take care: make sure you are not affected before you drive or use machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Xolair If you are a diabetic or have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking Xolair.
Xolair contains sucrose.
3.
HOW TO USE XOLAIR
Your doctor or nurse will give you Xolair as an injection just under the skin.
Before you start Xolair therapy, your doctor will do a blood test to measure the amount of IgE in your blood.
The doctor will work out how much Xolair you need and how often you will be given it.
This will depend on your body weight and the amount of IgE measured in your blood.
87 Follow your doctor’ s instructions carefully.
How much you will be given You will be given 1-3 injections.
The injections will be given every two weeks, or every four weeks.
You will need to carry on taking your current asthma medicine during Xolair treatment.
Do not stop taking any asthma medications without talking to your doctor.
You may not see an immediate improvement in your asthma after beginning Xolair therapy.
It usually takes several weeks to have the full effect.
If a dose of Xolair is missed Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment.
If you stop treatment with Xolair Interrupting or ending the treatment with Xolair may cause your asthma symptoms to come back.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS

91 INFORMATION FOR THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
The lyophilised product takes 15-20 minutes to dissolve, although in some cases it may take longer.
The fully reconstituted product will appear clear or slightly opaque and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial.
Because of the viscosity of the reconstituted product care must be taken to WITHDRAW ALL OF THE PRODUCT from the vial before expelling any air or excess solution from the syringe in order to obtain the 0.6 ml.
To prepare Xolair 75 mg vials for subcutaneous administration, please adhere to the following instructions:
1.
Draw 0.9 ml of water for injections from the ampoule into a syringe equipped with a large-bore 18-gauge needle.
2.
With the vial placed upright on a flat surface, insert the needle and transfer the water for injections into the vial containing the lyophilised powder using standard aseptic techniques, directing the water for injections directly onto the powder.
3.
Keeping the vial in an upright position, vigorously swirl it (do not shake) for approximately 1 minute to evenly wet the powder.
4.
To aid in dissolution after completing step 3, gently swirl the vial for 5-10 seconds approximately every 5 minutes in order to dissolve any remaining solids.
Note that in some cases it may take longer than 20 minutes for the powder to dissolve completely.
If this is the case, repeat step 4 until there are no visible gel-like particles in the solution.
When the product is fully dissolved, there should be no visible gel-like particles in the solution.
Small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial are common.
The reconstituted product will appear clear or slightly opaque.
Do not use if solid particles are present.
5.
Invert the vial for at least 15 seconds in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper.
Using a new 3-ml syringe equipped with a large-bore, 18-gauge needle, insert the needle into the inverted vial.
Keeping the vial inverted position the needle tip at the very bottom of the solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe.
Before removing the needle from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to remove all of the solution from the inverted vial.
6.
Replace the 18-gauge needle with a 25-gauge needle for subcutaneous injection.
7.
Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required 0.6 ml dose.
A thin layer of small bubbles may remain at the top of the solution in the syringe.
Because the solution is slightly viscous, it may take take 5-10 seconds to administer the solution by subcutaneous injection.
The vial delivers 0.6 ml (75 mg) of Xolair.
8.
The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm or the thigh.

WHAT XOLAIR IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Xolair is used to prevent asthma getting worse and to control asthma symptoms when given in addition to other asthma medication.
Xolair is used to control symptoms of severe allergic asthma in adults or adolescents (12 years of age and older) whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by high-dose steroid inhalers or beta- agonist inhalers.
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body.
IgE plays a key role in causing allergic asthma.
Your doctor will measure the amount of IgE in your blood before giving you Xolair injections.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE XOLAIR
Do not use Xolair
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of Xolair.
The
ingredients are listed in section 6 of this leaflet.
Talk to your doctor before you have an injection.
Take special care with Xolair Do not use Xolair to treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack.
You will have been given a separate medicine for this.
Watch out for allergic reactions to Xolair.
Xolair contains a protein, and proteins can cause serious allergic reactions in some people.
Signs include rash, difficulty in breathing, swelling or feeling faint.
If you have an allergic reaction after taking Xolair, contact a doctor as soon as you can.
Do not use Xolair to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as:
- sudden allergic reactions
- hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder)
- aspergillosis (a fungus-related lung disease)
- food allergy, allergic skin rash or hay fever.
93 Xolair will not harm you but you may need other medicines to treat these conditions.
Xolair in children Do not give Xolair to children under 12 years of age.
Not enough is known about its effect on younger children.
Xolair and older people Xolair may be given to people aged 65 years and over.
There is no evidence to suggest that any special precautions are needed when older people are treated, although experience is still limited.
Patients with kidney or liver problems If you have kidney or liver problems, please talk to your doctor about using Xolair.
Parasite infections If you are living in a region where parasite infections are frequent or travelling to such a region, please tell your doctor.
Xolair may weaken your resistance to such infections.
If you are taking a treatment against parasite infection, please tell your doctor.
Xolair may reduce the efficacy of your treatment.
Taking other medicines Xolair can be used together with inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma, but it is still important to tell your doctor that you are taking them before you are given Xolair.
You will need to carry on taking your current asthma medicine during Xolair treatment.
Do not stop taking any asthma medications without talking to your doctor.
If you are taking a treatment against parasite infection, please tell your doctor.
Xolair may reduce the efficacy of your treatment.
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.

3.
HOW TO USE XOLAIR
Your doctor or nurse will give you Xolair as an injection just under the skin.
Before you start Xolair therapy, your doctor will do a blood test to measure the amount of IgE in your blood.
The doctor will work out how much Xolair you need and how often you will be given it.
This will depend on your body weight and the amount of IgE measured in your blood.
94 Follow your doctor’ s instructions carefully.
How much you will be given You will be given 1-3 injections.
The injections will be given every two weeks, or every four weeks.
You will need to carry on taking your current asthma medicine during Xolair treatment.

Xolair syringes are intended to be used by a healthcare professional only.
Preparing the syringe for use Warning:
Prior to completion of the injection, avoid contact with the device activation clips (see first illustration) to keep from prematurely covering the needle with the needle guard.
1.
Take the box containing the syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it unopened for about 20 minutes so that it reaches room temperature.
2.
When you are ready to use the syringe, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
3.
Clean the injection site.
4.
Remove the plastic tray from the box, peel back the paper cover, and remove the syringe.
5.
Inspect the syringe.
DO NOT USE if it is broken or if the liquid looks cloudy or contains particles.
In all these cases, return the entire pack to the pharmacy.
6.
Holding the syringe horizontally (as shown below), look into the viewing window to check the dose (75 mg or 150 mg) of medicine and the expiry date printed on the label.
Note:
Rotate the inner part of the syringe assembly as shown below so that the label can be read in the viewing window.
DO NOT USE if the product has expired or if the dose is incorrect.
In both these cases, return the entire pack to the pharmacy.
105 7.
Hold the syringe vertically with the plunger uppermost and tap the side of the syringe against your finger to allow the air bubble to rise.
Having an air bubble is acceptable.
You do not have to expel any air before use.
8.
Check to see if the liquid level is at or above the minimum fill line.
If the liquid is below the fill line, return the entire pack to the pharmacy.
Using the syringe
Carefully pull off the needle cap from the syringe and discard it.
Do not touch the exposed needle.
Gently pinch the skin at the injection site and insert the needle.
Holding onto the finger flange, slowly depress the plunger as far as it will go.
Keep the plunger fully depressed until after you have withdrawn the needle from the injection site.
If any solution leaks from the injection site, insert the needle further.
Keeping the plunger fully depressed, carefully lift the needle straight out from the injection site.
106 Slowly release the plunger and allow the needle guard to automatically cover the exposed needle.
Hold gauze on the injection site for approximately 30 seconds.
Disposal instructions Dispose of the used syringe immediately in a sharps container.
