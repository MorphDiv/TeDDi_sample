If a Plugin can not be Activated
If a plugin fails to activate because it requires a software module that is not available, its plugin information will display a message like this:
Plugin could not be read due to an error:
Python module 'gdata' is needed
This means that you need to install a needed python module from your distribution—and possibly the plugin documentation can tell you how.
The plugin may also unexpectedly fail to load, and display a different error message. It may then be a program error in either the plugin or

Kupfer's default mode is the command mode: If you type a query, kupfer will search for a match in its catalog.
The arrow keys allow you to browse query matches quite naturally, going to the previous or next match, and going up and down in the subcatalogs.

The Catalog
The Catalog is the collection of objects you can access in Kupfer, such as documents and programs.
Objects in the catalog that have content, like folders, are marked with an arrow. Pressing
Most subcatalogs update their content automatically. For example, the Desktop folder source is always up-to-date.
