Database Functions
This section deals with functions used with data organised as one row of data for one record.
The Database category may be confused with a database integrated in $[officename].
However, there is no connection between a database in $[officename] and the Database category in $[officename] Calc.
Example Data:
The following data will be used in some of the function description examples:
The range A1:E10 lists the children invited to Joe's birthday party.
The following information is given for each entry: column A shows the name, B the grade, then age in years, distance to school in metres and weight in kilograms.

DCOUNT
5
The formula in cell B16 is =DCOUNT(A1:E10; 0; A13:E14)
Database Function Parameters:
The following items are the parameter definitions for all database functions:
Database
is the cell range defining the database.
DatabaseField
specifies the column on which the function operates after the search criteria of the first parameter is applied and the data rows are selected.
It is not related to the search criteria itself.
Use the number 0 to specify the whole data range.
To reference a column by means of the column header name, place quotation marks around the header name.
SearchCriteria
is the cell range containing search criteria.
If you write several criteria in one row they are connected by AND.
If you write the criteria in different rows they are connected by OR.
Empty cells in the search criteria range will be ignored.
Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME Calc - Calculate
to define how $[officename] Calc acts when searching for identical entries.
Conditional Counting and Summation
.
DCOUNT function
counting rows;with numerical values
mw added &quot; counting rows; &quot;
DCOUNT
DCOUNT counts the number of rows (records) in a database that match the specified search criteria and contain numerical values.
Syntax:
DCOUNT(Database; DatabaseField; SearchCriteria)
Example:
=DCOUNT(A1:E10; 0; A13:E14)
in B16.
The
Function Wizard
helps you to input ranges.
Database
is the range of data to be evaluated, including its headers: in this case A1:E10.
DatabaseField
specifies the column for the search criteria: in this case, the whole database.
SearchCriteria
is the range in which you can enter the search parameters: in this case, A13:E14.
2
in cell B14 under Grade and enter
> 7
in cell C14 to the right.
The result is 2.
Two children are in second grade and over 7 years of age.
As both criteria are in the same row, they are connected by AND.
DCOUNTA function
records;counting in Calc databases
counting rows;with numerical or alphanumerical values
mw added &quot; records; &quot; and &quot; counting rows; &quot;
DCOUNTA
DCOUNTA counts the number of rows (records) in a database that match the specified search conditions and contain numerical or alphanumerical values.
Syntax:
DCOUNTA(Database; DatabaseField; SearchCriteria)
Example:
=DCOUNTA(A1:E10; &quot; Age &quot; ; A13:E14)
.
Delete the old search criteria and enter
> =E
under Name in field A14.
The result is 5.
If you now delete all number values for Greta in row 8, the result changes to 4.
Row 8 is no longer included in the count because it does not contain any values.
The name Greta is text, not a value.
Note that the DatabaseField parameter must point to a column that can contain values.
DGET function
cell contents;searching in Calc databases
searching;cell contents in Calc databases
mw added &quot; cell contents; &quot; and &quot; searching; &quot;
DGET
DGET returns the contents of the referenced cell in a database which matches the specified search criteria.
In case of an error, the function returns either
#VALUE!
for no row found, or
Err502
for more than one cell found.
Syntax:
DGET(Database; DatabaseField; SearchCriteria)
Example:
DatabaseField
.
Enter the following formula:
=DGET(A1:E10; &quot; Grade &quot; ; A13:E14)
Frank
in A14 and you will see the result 2.
Frank is in second grade.
Enter
&quot; Age &quot;
instead of &quot; Grade &quot; and you will get Frank's age.
11
in cell C14 only and delete the other entries in this row.
Edit the formula in B16 as follows:
=DGET(A1:E10; &quot; Name &quot; ; A13:E14)
Instead of the grade, the name is queried.
The answer appears at once:
Daniel is the only child aged 11.
DMAX function

searching;maximum values in columns
mw added &quot; maximum... &quot; and &quot; searching; &quot;
DMAX
DMAX returns the maximum content of a cell (field) in a database (all records) that matches the specified search conditions.
Syntax:
DMAX(Database; DatabaseField; SearchCriteria)
Example:
To find out how much the heaviest child in each grade weighed in the above example (scroll up, please), enter the following formula in B16:
=DMAX(A1:E10; &quot; Weight &quot; ; A13:E14)
1, 2, 3,
and so on, one after the other.
After entering a grade number, the weight of the heaviest child in that grade appears.
DMIN function
minimum values in Calc databases
searching;minimum values in columns
mw added &quot; minimum... &quot; and &quot; searching; &quot;
DMIN
DMIN returns the minimum content of a cell (field) in a database that matches the specified search criteria.

DAVERAGE returns the average of the values of all cells (fields) in all rows (database records) that match the specified search criteria.
Syntax:
DAVERAGE(Database; DatabaseField; SearchCriteria)
Example:
To find the average weight of all children of the same age in the above example (scroll up, please), enter the following formula in B16:
=DAVERAGE(A1:E10; &quot; Weight &quot; ; A13:E14)
7, 8, 9,
and so on, one after the other.
The average weight of all children of the same age appears.
