EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
BARACLUDE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Baraclude?
Baraclude contains the active substance entecavir.
It is available as tablets (white:
0.5 mg, pink:
1 mg) or as an oral solution (0.05 mg/ ml).
What is Baraclude used for?
Baraclude is used to treat adult patients who have chronic (long term) hepatitis B (disease of the liver due to an infection by the hepatitis B virus).
It is used in patients who have compensated liver disease (when the liver is damaged but functions normally), who also show signs that the virus is still multiplying, and signs of liver damage (raised liver enzyme, signs of damage when liver tissue is examined under a microscope).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Baraclude used?
Treatment with Baraclude should be started by a doctor with experience in the management of chronic hepatitis B.
Baraclude is taken once daily.
The dose depends on whether or not the patient has been previously treated for chronic hepatitis B with a medicine in the same group as Baraclude (a nucleoside analogue, such as lamivudine).
Patients who have not been treated before with a nucleoside analogue receive a 0.5 mg dose, while the 1 mg dose is used in patients who have received lamivudine before, but who are now ‘ refractory’ (no longer responding) to lamivudine.
The 0.5 mg dose can be taken with or without food, but the 1 mg dose must be taken at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal.
Doses are lower for patients who have kidney problems, for whom the oral solution can be used.
The treatment duration is determined according to the patient’ s response.
How does Baraclude work?
The active substance in Baraclude, entecavir, is an antiviral belonging to the class of the nucleoside analogues.
Entecavir interferes with the action of a viral enzyme, DNA polymerase, which is involved in the formation of viral DNA.
Entecavir stops the virus making DNA, and prevents it from multiplying and spreading.
How has Baraclude been studied?
The effects of Baraclude were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.

Patients were mostly male, aged between 35 and 44 years of age, and they received at least one year of treatment with either Baraclude or lamivudine.
Two studies (1,363 patients) were carried out in nucleoside-naïve patients (these are patients who have not been treated with nucleoside analogues before).
The other study (293 patients) was carried out in patients who had become refractory to lamivudine treatment.
The studies measured the effectiveness of the treatment by looking at how the liver damage had evolved after 48 weeks treatment (using a liver biopsy, when a sample of liver tissue is taken and examined under a microscope) as well as measuring other signs of the disease such as the levels of a liver enzyme (ALT) or viral DNA circulating in the blood of the patients.
What benefit has Baraclude shown during the studies?
Baraclude was more effective than lamivudine in treatment-naïve patients: an improvement in the condition of the liver was seen in just over 70% of the patients treated with Baraclude, against just over 60% of the patients treated with lamivudine.
These results were seen both in patients who were ‘ HBeAg positive ’ (infected with the common hepatitis B virus) and in those who were ‘ HBeAg negative ’ (infected with a virus that has mutated, leading to a form of chronic hepatitis B that is more difficult to treat).
Baraclude was also more effective than lamivudine in patients refractory to lamivudine:
55% of patients treated with Baraclude had improvements in the condition of their liver, against 28% of those treated with lamivudine.
At the end of the study, 55% of the patients treated with Baraclude had both a normal ALT level and undetectable viral DNA in their blood, when 4% of those treated with lamivudine showed the same results.
What is the risk associated with Baraclude?
In clinical studies, the most common side effects were headache (seen in 9% of patients), fatigue (tiredness, 6%), dizziness (4%) and nausea (feeling sick, 3%).
For the full list of side effects reported with Baraclude, see the Package Leaflet.
Baraclude should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to entecavir or any of the other ingredients.
Patients and doctors need to be aware that Baraclude belongs to a group of medicines, the nucleoside analogues, which have been known to cause ‘ lactic acidosis’: when the level of the chemical lactic acid becomes abnormally high in the blood, causing nausea, vomiting and stomach pain.
Patients also need to know that they may also suffer a worsening of their liver disease.
This can happen during the treatment, or after it has been stopped.
Resistance to entecavir (when a virus becomes insensitive to the antiviral) has been seen in lamivudine-refractory patients.
As resistance may have an impact on effectiveness, this will be closely monitored during long-term follow-up.
Why has Baraclude been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Baraclude had shown that it was as or more effective than the current treatment for hepatitis B virus infections.
They decided that Baraclude’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B with compensated liver disease.
They recommended that Baraclude be given marketing authorisation.
