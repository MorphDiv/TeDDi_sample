Introduction
Welcome to the & kde; User Guide
This User Guide aims to provide an overview of the entire & kde; experience. We assume here that you have a standard, working installation of a complete & kde; desktop environment, and the accompanying packages. This book should be your first point of reference for any simple & kde; configuration question, or to find out how to perform a common task.
What this book aims to be
The first place to look and a one stop shop for all questions you have regarding your & kde; experience.
A Quick Start Guide to commonly performed tasks - In most cases, you do not need to know the details of how to configure every option in an application, in order to get down to work. You will find step-by-step guides which will work in most common situations, along with links to sources of further information in case you have any problems.
There are also some tips and tricks showing you the most useful and impressive features of & kde;, and ways to save you time and effort.
What this book is not
The User Guide is not intended to be a replacement for the application manuals. You should turn to the handbook for help with specific program configuration and troubleshooting issues not covered in this book. If the answer is outside the scope of this book, we will tell you here precisely where to look for further help.
You may also have a variety of third party packages, and some of these applications are mentioned briefly here, but we normally cover only the applications provided as part of a & kde; release. This is not a judgment on the value of third party applications, and in fact many of them are excellent.
The User Guide is not specific to a distribution, and covers a default & kde; installation. Your local installation may be customized by your distribution provider, or by yourself, and so our advice here is generic. You may have to adjust paths in order to locate the files that are discussed.

System Locations
You may need to know the following system locations:
& kde; prefix
& kde; installs into its own folder tree, which you can find by running the command kde4-config --prefix. This folder is referred to by the environment variables $KDEDIRS and possibly $KDEDIR.
& kde; user-specific settings
The environment variable $KDEHOME points to the folder where & kde; should find user-specific settings. If it is not set, the default value of ~/. kde is used.
Overview, or Where to look in the User Guide
Here's an overview of what's in the User Guide:
contains an introduction to the basic use of & kde;, such as, and the tools that you'll be using in all & kde; applications, like. If you're new to & kde; or even computers in general, you will probably find this section helpful.
explains some important components of a & kde; installation and how they fit together: & kde; 's multimedia and networking capabilities are extensive, and not covered thoroughly here, but there's a taster of both of them in this part of the User Guide. At the end of this part, you'll find a guide to tweaking & kde; just that little bit more, in.
highlights & kde; 's suite of Internet applications. & kde; includes a powerful web browser, & konqueror;, a full-featured email client, & kmail;, a news reader, & knode;, and many more applications to make your Internet experience easier and more productive. This part of the User Guide contains information about setting up these applications.
is a reference guide to some & kde; features which will be useful to administrators setting up multi-user systems. This part also has information that may be useful to & kde; users with single-user systems: where configuration files are stored, what environment variables affect & kde;, and so on. The KIOSK framework is the & kde; system which allows administrators to limit what users can do in & kde;. It is potentially useful in many situations, but especially for running single-function kiosks with, for example, just a web browser, hence the name.
The Desktop
The Basics
The desktop Desktop is just the name for the layout of the screen when you start & kde;. It looks something like this (on your own system, it might look slightly different, but the main features should be the same):
A default desktop layout
Let us look at the most important parts:
Most of the screen is taken up by the background Background. At the moment, there is a picture making up the background. This picture is usually referred to as the wallpaper, Wallpaper and you can change it to make & kde; suit your taste.
In the top left-hand corner are two icons: Trash and Home. Clicking on these will open your Trash folder and Home folder, respectively. You can add more icons to the desktop so that you can open your favorite programs, or access removable media, with just one click.
At the bottom is the & kde; Panel Panel, also known as kicker;. The Panel contains several useful ways of interacting with & kde;. It houses the & kmenu;, from where you can open any & kde; application installed on your computer, it shows all the programs that are currently running, as well as the time, and more. Take a look at for more information about the & kde; Panel.

Logging In and Logging Out
Basic KDM & startkde stuff.
There are two ways to log into & kde;: graphically and via the command line. We'll look at them both briefly:
Logging in Graphically
login
& kdm;
If you see a screen a little bit like the one below when you start up your computer, then you are all set for logging in graphically. Just enter your username in the Login text box and your password in the Password text box. Your password will not be shown as you type it; it will probably be shown as asterisks. When you have entered that information, click on the Login button, and & kde; will start up. The & kde; splash screen will appear, and keep you informed about the progress of & kde; startup, and when it is done, & kde; will be ready to use.
Logging in via the Command Line
startkde
startx
If you prefer using the command line, you can log in to & kde; with the startx command. Add the line exec startkde to the. xinitrc file in your home folder (create it if it does not exist), save the file, and then run startx. & kde; should start in the same way as if you had logged in graphically.
Logging Out
logout
Once you have finished using & kde; for the moment, you will want to log out until next time. The easiest way to do this is to click on the & kmenu; at the bottom left of your screen, and then select the Log Out... item. A dialog with the text End session for username will appear. To confirm that you want to log out, click on the End Current Session button. If you change your mind, and decide to carry on using & kde; for now, hit Cancel.
Related Information
The & kdm; Handbook has information about using and setting up the & kde; graphical login manager. You can read it in & khelpcenter; or by entering help: / kdm in & konqueror; 's Location bar.
