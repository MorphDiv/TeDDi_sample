EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
DRAXXIN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is DRAXXIN?
DRAXXIN contains tulathromycin, which belongs to a class of medicines having an antibiotic action.
DRAXXIN is a solution for injection (100 mg/ ml).
What is DRAXXIN used for?
DRAXXIN is used to treat the following diseases if they are caused by bacteria that are sensitive to tulathromycin: • bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in cattle caused by Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni or Mycoplasma bovis, • infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) in cattle, an eye disease caused by Moraxella bovis, • swine respiratory disease (SRD) in pigs caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae or Haemophilus parasuis.
DRAXXIN can also be used to prevent BRD and SRD. The medicine should only be used for prevention in cattle and pigs once the presence of the disease in the herd has been established, and for pigs if they are expected to develop the disease within two to three days.
DRAXXIN is given as a single injection of 2.5 mg per kilogram body weight.
In cattle, it is injected under the skin, and the dose is divided in cattle weighing over 300 kg so that no more than 7.5 ml are injected at one site.
In pigs it is injected into a muscle, and the dose is divided in pigs weighing over 80 kg so that no more than 2 ml are injected at one site.
It is recommended that animals are treated in the early stages of the disease and that their response is evaluated within 48 hours.
If symptoms continue to be present, get worse or come back, treatment should be changed to another antibiotic.
How does DRAXXIN work?
The active substance in DRAXXIN, tulathromycin, is an antibiotic that belongs to the class ‘ macrolides’.
It works by attaching to the RNA (the molecules that instruct the cell how to make proteins) within the bacterial cells.
This prevents the bacteria being able to make vital proteins and stops them growing and multiplying.
DRAXXIN is effective against the bacteria that most commonly cause BRD, SRD and IBK.
However, some bacteria can develop resistance against tulathromycin, which will reduce its effectiveness.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged How has DRAXXIN been studied?
The effectiveness of DRAXXIN in treating or preventing BRD has been studied in nine main studies involving calves, carried out during an outbreak of the disease.
In the treatment studies, the cattle were infected with BRD-causing bacteria, but the cattle in the prevention studies had no symptoms of the disease.
DRAXXIN was compared with tilmicosin or florfenicol (other antibiotics), and, in the prevention studies also with placebo (a dummy treatment).
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms, including body temperature, breathing and recovery over a period of between two weeks and two months.
For the treatment of IBK, the effectiveness of DRAXXIN has been studied in three main studies involving calves.
In two studies, it was compared with the effectiveness of placebo, but the third also compared it to oxytetracycline (another antibiotic).
The main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of cattle whose disease had been cured after three weeks.
The effectiveness of DRAXXIN in treating SRD has been studied in pigs in two main studies, where it was compared with tiamulin or florfenicol.
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in symptoms over 10 days.
For the prevention of SRD, the effectiveness of DRAXXIN was studied in six main studies, in which it was compared with placebo.
The main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of pigs that completed the full three or six weeks of each study without needing to be removed from the study because of SRD.
What benefit has DRAXXIN shown during the studies?
A single 2.5-mg/ kg dose of DRAXXIN was effective in treating and preventing BRD in cattle and SRD in pigs.
In all studies, DRAXXIN was at least as effective as the comparator medicines.
Looking at the studies taken together, it was more effective than placebo.
In two of the three studies of IBK, DRAXXIN was more effective than placebo in curing the disease.
However, the third study found no difference between the effectiveness of DRAXXIN, oxytetracycline and placebo.
The reasons for this are not clear.
What is the risk associated with DRAXXIN?
The subcutaneous injection of DRAXXIN to cattle often causes temporary pain and swelling at the injection site, which can last up to 30 days.
These reactions have not been seen in pigs after intramuscular injection.
Other types of reaction to the injection persist for about 30 days after injection in cattle and pigs.
DRAXXIN should not be used in animals that are hypersensitive (allergic) to macrolideantibiotics.
It should also not be used at the same time as other macrolide antibiotics or lincosamides (another type of antibiotic medicine), in cattle that are producing milk for human consumption, or in pregnant cows intended to produce milk for human consumption within two months of their expected date of giving birth.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
DRAXXIN can irritate the eyes.
If DRAXXIN accidentally get into the eyes, flush them immediately with clean water.
DRAXXIN may also cause sensitisation (redness, itching and swelling) if it comes into contact with the skin.
If accidental skin exposure occurs, wash the skin immediately with soap and water.
Wash hands after use.
In case of accidental self- injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the Package Leaflet or the label to the doctor.

What is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption?
For cattle intended for consumption as either meat or offal, 49 days must be allowed before slaughter.
For pigs intended for consumption as either meat or offal, 33 days must be allowed.
What is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption?
DRAXXIN must not be used in cattle that are producing milk for human consumption, or in pregnant cows intended to produce milk for human consumption within two months of their expected date of giving birth.
Why has DRAXXIN been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of DRAXXIN exceed the risks for the treatment and prevention of BRD and the treatment of IBK in cattle, and for the treatment and prevention of SRD in pigs, and recommended that DRAXXIN be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about DRAXXIN:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for DRAXXIN to Pfizer Limited on 23 July 2003.
