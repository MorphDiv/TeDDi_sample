Okular is currently generating bitmap fonts...
Aborts the font generation. Do not do this.
Okular is currently generating bitmap fonts which are needed to display your document. For this, Okular uses a number of external programs, such as MetaFont. You can find the output of these programs later in the document info dialog.
Okular is generating fonts. Please wait.
Okular was not able to locate all the font files which are necessary to display the current DVI file. Your document might be unreadable.
Not All Font Files Found
Locating fonts...
Okular relies on the kpsewhich program to locate font files on your hard disk and to generate PK fonts, if necessary.
There were problems running kpsewhich. As a result, some font files could not be located, and your document might be unreadable. Possible reason: The kpsewhich program is perhaps not installed on your system, or it cannot be found in the current search path. What you can do: The kpsewhich program is normally contained in distributions of the TeX typesetting system. If TeX is not installed on your system, you could install the TeX Live distribution (www. tug. org/ texlive). If you are sure that TeX is installed, please try to use the kpsewhich program from the command line to check if it really works.
Problem locating fonts
The font generation by kpsewhich was aborted (exit code %1, error %2). As a result, some font files could not be located, and your document might be unreadable.

Currently generating %1 at %2 dpi
The DVI file does not start with the preamble.
The DVI file contains the wrong version of DVI output for this program. Hint: If you use the typesetting system Omega, you have to use a special program, such as oxdvi.
The DVI file is badly corrupted. Okular was not able to find the postamble.
The postamble does not begin with the POST command.
The postamble contained a command other than FNTDEF.
The page %1 does not start with the BOP command.
The external program pdf2ps could not be started. As a result, the PDF-file %1 could not be converted to PostScript. Some graphic elements in your document will therefore not be displayed. Possible reason: The program pdf2ps may not be installed on your system, or cannot be found in the current search path. What you can do: The program pdf2ps is normally contained in distributions of the ghostscript PostScript interpreter system. If ghostscipt is not installed on your system, you could install it now. If you are sure that ghostscript is installed, try to use pdf2ps from the command line to check if it really works. PATH: %2
The PDF-file %1 could not be converted to PostScript. Some graphic elements in your document will therefore not be displayed. Possible reason: The file %1 might be broken, or might not be a PDF-file at all. This is the output of the pdf2ps program that Okular used: %2
Cannot find font %1, file %2.
Checksum mismatch for font file %1
Cannot recognize format for font file %1
Cannot open font file %1.
TexFont_PK: :operator[]: Character %1 not defined in font %2
Unexpected %1 in PK file %2
The character %1 is too large in file %2
Wrong number of bits stored: char. %1, font %2
Bad pk file (%1), too many bits
Font has non-square aspect ratio
Please be patient
Okular could not locate the program'dvipdfm 'on your computer. This program is essential for the export function to work. You can, however, convert the DVI-file to PDF using the print function of Okular, but that will often produce documents which print okay, but are of inferior quality if viewed in Acrobat Reader. It may be wise to upgrade to a more recent version of your TeX distribution which includes the'dvipdfm' program. Hint to the perplexed system administrator: Okular uses the PATH environment variable when looking for programs.

Using dvipdfm to export the file to PDF
Okular is currently using the external program'dvipdfm 'to convert your DVI-file to PDF. Sometimes that can take a while because dvipdfm needs to generate its own bitmap fonts Please be patient.
Waiting for dvipdfm to finish...
Export: %1 to PDF
The external program'dvipdfm ', which was used to export the file, reported an error. You might wish to look at the document info dialog which you will find in the File-Menu for a precise error report.
This DVI file refers to external graphic files which are not in PostScript format, and cannot be handled by the dvips program that Okular uses interally to print or to export to PostScript. The functionality that you require is therefore unavailable in this version of Okular. As a workaround, you can use the File/ Export As-Menu to save this file in PDF format, and then use a PDF viewer. It is planned to add this functionality at a later date.
Functionality Unavailable
Okular could not locate the program'dvips' on your computer. That program is essential for the export function to work. Hint to the perplexed system administrator: Okular uses the PATH environment variable when looking for programs.

The version of Ghostview that is installed on this computer does not contain any of the Ghostview device drivers that are known to Okular. PostScript support has therefore been turned off in Okular.
The Ghostview program, which Okular uses internally to display the PostScript graphics that is included in this DVI file, is generally able to write its output in a variety of formats. The sub-programs that Ghostview uses for these tasks are called'device drivers'; there is one device driver for each format that Ghostview is able to write. Different versions of Ghostview often have different sets of device drivers available. It seems that the version of Ghostview that is installed on this computer does not contain any of the device drivers that are known to Okular. It seems unlikely that a regular installation of Ghostview would not contain these drivers. This error may therefore point to a serious misconfiguration of the Ghostview installation on your computer. If you want to fix the problems with Ghostview, you can use the command gs --help to display the list of device drivers contained in Ghostview. Among others, Okular can use the'png256 ', 'jpeg' and'pnm 'drivers. Note that Okular needs to be restarted to re-enable PostScript support.
The DVI code set a character of an unknown font.
The stack was not empty when the EOP command was encountered.
The stack was empty when a POP command was encountered.
The DVI code referred to a font which was not previously defined.
An illegal command was encountered.
The unknown op-code %1 was encountered.
Fatal error.
This probably means that either you found a bug in Okular, or that the DVI file, or auxiliary files (such as font files, or virtual font files) were really badly broken. Okular will abort after this message. If you believe that you found a bug, or that Okular should behave better in this situation please report the problem.
The fontlist is currently empty.
