Advanced text editor for & kde;
kate -s, --start name -u, --use -p, --pid pid -e, --encoding name -l, --line line -c, --column column -i, --stdin KDE Generic Options Qt Generic Options
Description
& kate; is the & kde; Advanced Text Editor.
& kate; also provides the editor part for various applications, under the name & kwrite;.
Some of & kate; 's many features include configurable syntax highlighting for languages ranging from C and C++ to HTML to bash scripts, the ability to create and maintain projects, a multiple document interface (MDI), and a self-contained terminal emulator.
But & kate; is more than a programmer's editor. Its ability to open several files at once makes it ideal for editing & UNIX; 's many configuration files. This document was written in & kate;.
Options
-s, --start name
Start & kate; with a given session.
-u, --use
Use an already running & kate;
-p, --pid pid
Only try to reuse kate instance with this pid
-e, --encoding name
Set encoding for the file to open
You can use this to force a file opened in utf-8 format, for instance. (The command iconv -l provides a list of encodings, which may be helpful to you.)
-l, --line line
Navigate to this line
-c, --column column
Navigate to this column
-i, --stdin
Read the contents of stdin

More detailed user documentation is available from help: / kate (either enter this URL into & konqueror;, or run khelpcenter help: / kate).
There is also further information available at the & kate; website.
Examples
To open a file named source. cpp at column 15, line 25, in an existing & kate; window, you could use:
kate -c 15 -l 25 -u source. cpp
If you have an active internet connection, you can take advantage of & kde; 's network transparency to open a file from an ftp site. If you do not have write permission on the remote server, the file will be opened read only and you will be prompted for a local filename to save to if you make changes. If you do have write permission, changes will be saved transparently over the network.
