(PHP 3, PHP 4)
imagettftext() draws the string text in the image identified by image, starting at coordinates x, y (top left is 0, 0), at an angle of angle in color col, using the TrueType font file identified by fontfile.
Depending on which version of the GD library that PHP is using, when fontfile does not begin with a leading '/', '.ttf 'will be appended to the filename and the library will attempt to search for that filename along a library-defined font path.
The coordinates given by x, y will define the basepoint of the first character (roughly the lower-left corner of the character).
This is different from the imagestring(), where x, y define the upper-right corner of the first character.
angle is in degrees, with 0 degrees being left-to-right reading text (3 o'clock direction), and higher values representing a counter-clockwise rotation. (i.e., a value of 90 would result in bottom-to-top reading text).
fontfile is the path to the TrueType font you wish to use.
text is the text string which may include UTF-8 character sequences (of the form: #123;) to access characters in a font beyond the first 255.
Col is the color index.
Using the negative of a color index has the effect of turning off antialiasing.
imagettftext() returns an array with 8 elements representing four points making the bounding box of the text.
The order of the points is lower left, lower right, upper right, upper left.
The points are relative to the text regardless of the angle, so "upper left" means in the top left-hand corner when you see the text horizontallty.
This example script will produce a black GIF 400x30 pixels, with the words "Testing..." in white in the font Arial.
Example 1. imagettftext() example
?php header( "Content-type: image / jpeg"); $im = imagecreate(400,30); $white = imagecolorallocate($im, 255,255,255); $black = imagecolorallocate($im, 0,0,0); / / Replace path by your own font path imagettftext($im, 20, 0, 10, 20, $black, "/ path / arial.ttf", "Testing...
Omega: amp; #937 ;"); imagejpeg($im); imagedestroy($im);?
This function requires both the GD library and the FreeType library.
