Getting Help
User Manuals
User Manual
Most applications come with a comprehensive user manual User Manual Handbook, which you can reach various ways:
By pressing F1 inside the application.
From the menu bar: Help Application name
By browsing to it in & khelpcenter;
& khelpcenter;
By using the help KIOslave in & konqueror;. So, in the Location Toolbar, simply type help: / Application name
Online at http: / /docs. kde. org
Context and What's This Help
Many applications also provide context help in two forms: Tooltips, and What's This help.
Tooltips
Tooltips
Tooltips are small informational windows or balloons that display when you hover the mouse over an item on your screen without clicking.
& kde; uses tooltips in many places to provide brief help or information about an item on your screen. For instance, most toolbar buttons inside applications will display their name in a tooltip if you rest or hover your mouse over them.
Tooltips have another function, which is not specifically tied to help. In the & konqueror; file manager and on your Desktop, tooltips can provide information about files. This is commonly referred to as meta information.
You can find out more about meta-information tooltips in the section about the & konqueror; file manager.
What's This?
What's This?
What's This? help is usually more detailed than tooltips. You can access What's This? help in two ways:
By pressing the? button in the titlebar of the window.
By pressing the key combination Shift; F1
The cursor will change to a pointer with a question mark next to it. Click on the item you want to know about, and a small window will pop up displaying information.

Mailing Lists
& kde; provides many mailing lists which can provide you with help and guidance in using and configuring your Desktop.
Some of the lists you might find useful are:
The & kde; User List
& kde; User Mailing List
This mailing list focuses specifically on OS -independent questions and discussions regarding using & kde;. Operating-system-specific questions and discussion are off-topic here. For example, the question How do I change the margin size for KWord documents is appropriate for this list; whereas How do I set up my printer using & kde; under UnixOS X. Y is not. Questions asked and discussions here should apply to all & kde; users using the applicable & kde; software, not just those using the same operating system.
You can subscribe to this list at https: / /mail. kde. org/ mailman/ listinfo/ kde.
You can find archives at http: / /lists. kde. org/ ?l=kde.
The & kde; -Linux; List
kde-linux Mailing List
This mailing list focusses specifically on questions and discussions regarding using & kde; on & Linux;. Questions and discussions can involve any issue confronting desktop users who run & kde; on a & Linux; system. Hence, questions such as How do I setup a networked printer for printing from & kde; on LinuxDistro X. Y are appropriate here.

You can subscribe to this list at https: / /mail. kde. org/ mailman/ listinfo/ kde-linux.
You can find archives at http: / /lists. kde. org/ ?l=kde-linux.
