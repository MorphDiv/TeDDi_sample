Hello, world!
Alternative greeting text.
If not empty, it contains the text that will be shown when clicking on the panel.
Example aims to show how to build well behaved extensions for the Shell and as such it has little functionality on its own.
Nevertheless it's possible to customize the greeting message.
Message:
Use more screen for windows
Try to use more screen for placing window thumbnails by adapting to screen aspect ratio, and consolidating them further to reduce the bounding box. This setting applies only with the natural placement strategy.
Place window captions on top
If true, place window captions on top the respective thumbnail, overriding shell default of placing it at the bottom. Changing this setting requires restarting the shell to have any effect.
