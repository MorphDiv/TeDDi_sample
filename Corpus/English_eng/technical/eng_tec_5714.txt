The Angular Distance calculator module
Angular Distance
The Angular Distance tool is used to measure the angle between any two points on the sky. You simply specify the Equatorial coordinates of the desired pair of points, and then press the Compute button to obtain the angle between the two points.
There is also a Batch mode for this module. In batch mode, you specify an input filename which contains four numbers per line: the RA and Dec values for pairs of points. Alternatively, you can specify a single value for any of these four coordinates in the calculator panel (the corresponding values in the input file should be skipped if they are specified in the calculator).
Once you have specified the input filename and an output filename, simply press the Run button to generate the output file.
