ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Duvaxyn WNV - emulsion for injection for horses
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each dose of 1 ml contains:
Active substance:
Inactivated West Nile Virus, strain VM-2
RP* 1.0- 2.2
*Relative potency by in vitro method, compared to a reference vaccine that was shown efficacious in horses.
Adjuvant:
MetaStim ™ (SP Oil)
0.05 ml
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Emulsion for injection.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target Species
Horses
4.2 Indications for use specifying the target species
For the active immunisation of horses of 6 months of age or older against West Nile Virus disease by reducing the number of viraemic horses.
Onset of immunity:
3 weeks after primary vaccination course.
Duration of immunity:
12 months after primary vaccination course.
4.3 Contraindications
None
4.4 Special warnings
None
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Only healthy animals should be vaccinated.
2 Vaccination may interfere with existing sero-epidemiological surveys.
However, since the IgM response following vaccination is infrequent, a positive IgM-ELISA test result is a strong indicator of natural infection with West Nile Virus.
If infection is suspected as a result of a positive IgM response, additional testing would need to be conducted to conclusively determine whether the animal was infected or vaccinated.
No specific studies have been conducted to demonstrate absence of interferences from maternally derived antibodies on vaccine take.
It is therefore recommended not to vaccinate foals of less than 6 months of age.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-injection, ingestion or spillage onto skin, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
A small number of animals may show transient local reactions in the form of a mild, local swelling at the injection site post vaccination (maximum 1 cm in diameter) that resolve spontaneously within 1 to 2 days.
It is sometimes associated with pain and mild depression.
In some cases hyperthermia may occur for up to 2 days.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Can be used during pregnancy and lactation.
No specific efficacy studies were conducted in pregnant mares.
As a consequence, it cannot be excluded that transient immunodepression that may be observed during pregnancy could interfere with vaccine uptake.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine when used with any other veterinary medicinal product.
A decision to use this vaccine before or after any other veterinary medicinal product therefore needs to be made on a case by case basis.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For intramuscular use.
Administer one dose (1 ml), by deep intramuscular injection in the neck region, according to the following schedule:
• Primary vaccination course: first injection from 6 months of age, second injection 3-5 weeks later. • Revaccination: a sufficient degree of protection should be achieved after an annual booster injection with a single dose although this schedule has not been fully validated.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Following the administration of a double dose of vaccine, no adverse reactions other than those described under section 4.6 have been observed.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Zero days.
