No Database Selected
This list box contains both general configuration items such as the device used for HotSync and the databases to be backed up as well as a list of conduits that KPilot may run during a HotSync. Click on an item to configure it. Conduits which are checked in this list will run during a HotSync.
This conduit appears to be broken and cannot be configured.
Conduits are external (possibly third-party) programs that perform synchronization actions. They may have individual configurations. Select a conduit to configure it, and enable it by clicking on its checkbox.
The general portion of KPilot's setup contains settings for your hardware and the way KPilot should display your data. For the basic setup, which should fulfill the need of most users, just use the setup wizard below. If you need some special settings, this dialog provides all the options for fine-tuning KPilot. But be warned: The HotSync settings are various esoteric things. You can enable an action or conduit by clicking on its checkbox. Checked conduits will be run during a HotSync. Select a conduit to configure it.

Check this box to enable bookmark creation when converting text files to Palm DOC databases. Most doc readers support bookmarks. In order to create a bookmark, it is necessary to provide the location in the text where the bookmark should be set and the bookmark title, in at least one of the formats listed below.
& Inline tags in text
Check this box to create bookmarks from inline tags in the text. The inline tag consist of tags in the form < * bookmarktext * >. The bookmark location is set using the location of the inline tag in the text, and the name is the text between the < * and the * >. The inline tag (< \*\.\.\.\* >) will be removed from the text.
& Encoding:
& Tags at end of text
Check this box to convert tags of the form < bookmarkname > at the end of the text to bookmarks. The text inside the tag ("bookmarkname") will be searched in the text, and whenever found, a bookmark will be set there. The endtags <\.\.\. > will then be removed from the end of the text.
Regular & expressions in. bmk file
Check this box to use regular expressions in a file to search the text for bookmarks. The file should have the same name as the text file, but should end in. bmk instead of. txt (for instance, the regular expression file for textname. txt should be textname. bmk). See the documentation for a description of the format of the bmk file.
Handheld - > PC
Do not convert, if text unchanged (only bookmarks)
Check this box to avoid syncing the text on the handheld to the PC if you only changed the bookmarks on the handheld (but not the text).
Convert Bookmarks
Do & not convert bookmarks
Check this box to avoid converting Palm DOC bookmarks to inline tags or to a bookmark file.
Convert into. bm & file
Check this box to convert the Palm DOC database bookmarks to a separate file, in the bmk format (see more about this format in the documentation). The resulting bookmark file shares the same filename as the resulting. txt file, but ends in. bmk instead. This approach creates a clean text file and a bookmark file.
Convert as & inline tags
Check this box to convert the Palm DOC database bookmarks to inline tags, in the form & lt; * BookmarkName *gt;. These tags are inserted in the text in the position marked by the bookmark, and the text inside the tag corresponds to the bookmark name. Inline tags are easy to create, delete, move and edit.
If the same text was changed on the PC and the handheld, which of the two versions should be used as the new version?
The Palm DOC conduit does not feature merging the modifications when a text is changed both in the handheld and in the computer. Therefore, the choice is between working with the files out of sync, or discarding the changes in one of them.

Enter the name of the folder where the text files reside on the PC. All files with extension. txt will be synced to the handheld.
When a< * bookm a rktext * > appears somewhere in the text, a bookmark will be set at this position, and the text between the< * and the* > will be used as bookmark name. The< \*\.\.\.\* > will be removed from the text.
Tags of the form < bookmarkname > at the end of the text will be used to search the text for the pattern between the < and >. Whenever "bookmarkname" appears in the text, a bookmark will be set there. The endtags <\.\.\. > will then be removed from the end of the text.
The Palm doc format supports compressing the text to save memory. If you check this box, the text will consume about 50% less memory than in uncompressed state. Almost all DOC readers on the Palm support compressed texts.
Do you want to convert bookmarks? Most doc readers support bookmarks. You have to provide some information about where the bookmarks should be set and their titles. Check at least one of the bookmark types below.
Use regular expressions in a file textname. bmk (textname. txt is the filename of the text) to search the text for bookmarks. See the documentation for a description of the format of the bmk file.

KPilot Options
& Default sync:
Select in this list the synchronization type that KPilot will use as default. Possible values are: "HotSync", to run all selected conduits, and sync the databases with a modified flag set, updating the modified records only; "FullSync" to run all selected conduits, and sync all databases, reading all records, and performing a full backup; "Copy PC to handheld" to run all conduits and sync all databases, but instead of merging the information from both sources, copy the PC data to the handheld; "Copy handheld to PC" to run all conduits and sync all databases, but instead of merging the information from both sources, copy the handheld data to the PC.
HotSync (sync all changes)
FullSync (sync also unchanged records)
Check this box to prevent KPilot from syncing your handheld while the screensaver is active: this is a security measure to prevent others from syncing their handhelds with your data. This option must be disabled when you use a different desktop, since KPilot is not aware of screensavers other than KDE's.
Do not sync when screensaver is active
Check this box to perform a full sync when your last sync was performed with another PC or system, to guarantee the completeness of your data.
Do full sync when changing PCs
Select in this list how conflicting entries (entries which were edited both on your handheld and on the PC) are resolved. Possibly values are "Ask User" to let you decide case by case, "Do Nothing" to allow the entries to be different, "PC overrides", "Handheld overrides", "Use values from last sync" and "Use both entries" to create a new entry on both the PC and handheld. Note that the conflict resolution option selected here can be overridden by conduits that have their own conflict resolution configuration.

Databases
Enter the databases types you wish to exclude from the backup operation here. Use this setting if backing up some databases crashes the handheld, or if you do not want a backup of some databases (like AvantGo pages). Entries with square brackets [] are creator codes like [lnch] and can exclude a whole range of databases. Entries without the brackets list database names, and may include shell-style wildcards, like *_a68k.

Enter the databases types you wish to exclude from the restore operation here (like AvantGo databases). They will be skipped even if they exist in the set of backup databases on the handheld. If you still want to install an ignored database to the handheld, you can always manually install it to the handheld. Entries with square brackets [] are creator codes like [lnch] and can exclude a whole range of databases. Entries without the brackets list database names, and may include shell-style wildcards, like *_a68k.

Enter the device the Pilot is attached to (for instance a serial or USB port) here. You can also use / dev/ pilot, and make that a symlink to the correct device. You need write permission to successfully synchronize with the handheld.
Pilot & device:
Select the speed of the serial connection to your handheld here. This has no meaning for USB devices. For an older model, choose 9600. Newer models may be able to handle speeds up to the maximum listed, 115200. You can experiment with the connection speed: the manual suggests starting at a speed of 19200 and trying faster speeds to see if they work.
& Speed:
Workarounds enable special handling for specific devices. Most devices do not need special handling. However, the Zire 31, Zire 72 and Tungsten T5 do have special needs, so if you are connecting such a device, please select the workaround for them.
& Workarounds:
PalmOS devices are available in many different languages. If your device uses a different encoding than ISO-latin1 (ISO8859-1), select the correct encoding here, in order to display special characters correctly.

Prevent HotSync when screen locked
Turning this option on prevents syncing when the screen is locked. This is a security measure to prevent people from stealing your data through physical access to a Pilot device link to your machine. It does not work with screensavers other than KDE, though, so you will need to turn it off for other environments.
