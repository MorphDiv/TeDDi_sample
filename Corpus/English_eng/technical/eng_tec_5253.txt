Operators

Bitwise operators allow you to turn specific bits within an integer on or off.
If both the left - and right-hand parameters are strings, the bitwise operator will operate on the characters in this string.
?php echo 12 ^ 9; / / Outputs '5 'echo "12 "^ "9"; / / Outputs the Backspace character (ascii 8) / / ('1' (ascii 49)) ^ ('9 '(ascii 57)) = #8 echo "hallo" ^ "hello"; / / Outputs the ascii values #0 #4 #0 #0 #0 / / 'a' ^ 'e '= #4?
Table 11-3.

Or
Bits that are set in either $a or $b are set.
$a ^ $b
Xor
Bits that are set in $a or $b but not both are set.
~ $a
