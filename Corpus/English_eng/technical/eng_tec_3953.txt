(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
mysql_fetch_object() is similar to mysql_fetch_array(), with one difference - an object is returned, instead of an array.
Indirectly, that means that you can only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers are illegal property names).
?php / * this is valid * / echo $row - field; / * this is invalid * / echo $row - 0;?
Speed-wise, the function is identical to mysql_fetch_array(), and almost as quick as mysql_fetch_row() (the difference is insignificant).
Example 1. mysql_fetch_object() example
?php mysql_connect( "hostname", "user", "password"); mysql_select_db($db); $result = mysql_query("select * from table"); while ($row = mysql_fetch_object($result)) {echo $row - user_id; echo $row - fullname;} mysql_free_result($result);?
