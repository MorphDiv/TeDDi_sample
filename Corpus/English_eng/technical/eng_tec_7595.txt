CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Pigs (sows and gilts)
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
For passive immunisation of piglets by active immunisation of sows and gilts to reduce mortality and clinical signs of neonatal enterotoxicosis, caused by those E. coli, which express the adhesins F4ab (K88ab), F4ac (K88ac), F5 (K99) or F6 (987P), during the first days of life.
4.3 Contraindications
None.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Not applicable.
1 SR80= sero-response in 80% of vaccinated rabbits
2/ 34 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
To the user:
This product contains mineral oil.
Accidental injection/ self injection may result in severe pain and swelling, particularly if injected into a joint or finger, and in rare cases could result in the loss of the affected finger if prompt medical attention is not given.
If you are accidentally injected with this product, seek prompt medical advice even if only a very small amount is injected and take the package leaflet with you.
If pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination, seek medical advice again.
To the physician:
This product contains mineral oil.
Even if small amounts have been injected, accidental injection with this product can cause intense swelling, which may, for example, result in ischaemic necrosis and even the loss of a digit.
Expert, PROMPT, surgical attention is required and may necessitate early incision and irrigation of the injected area, especially where there is involvement of finger pulp or tendon.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Mild, transient clinical reactions (fever, lethargy) may occur in the first 24 hours after vaccination.
For some weeks after vaccination a swelling may be present at the site of injection.
Local tissue reactions in the form of abscesses may frequently occur.
Six weeks after vaccination these local reactions are considerably decreased.
4.7 Use during pregnancy and lactation
Can be used during pregnancy.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy from concurrent use of this vaccine with any other.
It is therefore recommended that no other vaccine should be administered concurrently with the product.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Before using the vaccine allow it to reach room temperature (15-25°C) and shake vigorously before use.
Use sterile syringes and needles.
Intramuscular injection in sows and gilts of 2 ml per animal in the neck in the area behind the ear.
Vaccination scheme:
Basic vaccination:
Sows and gilts which have not been vaccinated with the product should be given two injections with an interval of six weeks.
Revaccination:
A single injection should be given prior to each farrowing.
Generally speaking this means every 5 to 6 months.
It is preferable to vaccinate sows and gilts during the second half of the pregnancy, but not within two weeks before the expected date of farrowing.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
No other undesirable effects observed at double dose when compared with one dose of vaccine.
3/ 34 4.11 Withdrawal period
Zero days
5.
IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: inactivated bacterial vaccine.
ATC vet code:
QI09AB02.
Vaccine to stimulate active immunity in order to provide passive immunity to the progeny against E. coli fimbrial adhesins F4ab, F4ac, F5 and F6.
The fimbrial adhesins F4ab, F4ac, F5, and F6 are responsible for the virulence of E. coli strains, which cause neonatal enterotoxicosis in piglets.
The immunogens are incorporated in a water-in-oil emulsion in order to enhance a prolonged stimulation of immunity.
Progeny of vaccinated sows and gilts derive a passive immunity via the colostrum.

PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS
6.1 List of excipients
Liquid paraffin Polysorbate 80 Sodium Chloride Sorbitan mono-oleate Water for injection
6.2 Incompatibilities
Do not mix with any other vaccine or immunological product.
6.3 Shelf life
2 years.
Broached vials:
3 hours.
6.4 Special precautions for storage
Store in a refrigerator (+2°C to +8°C).
Do not freeze.
Protect from light.
6.5 Nature and composition of immediate packaging
Cardboard box with 1 PET or glass (hydrolytic Type II) vial of 20 or 50 ml with a nitryl rubber stopper and a coded aluminium cap.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
6.6 Special precautions for the disposal of unused veterinary medicinal products or waste materials derived from the use of such products, if any
Any unused veterinary medicinal product or waste materials derived from such veterinary medicinal products should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Vaccinate only healthy animals.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In the case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
A mean transient increase in body temperature of about 1°C, in some pigs up to 3°C, may occur in the first 24 hours after vaccination.
Reduced feed intake and listlessness may occur in approximately 10% of the animals on the day of vaccination, but returns to normal within 1-3 days.
A transient swelling and redness at the injection site may be observed in approximately 5% of the animals.
The diameter of the swelling is in general below 5 cm, but in some cases a larger swelling may occur.
Swelling and redness at the injection site may occasionally last for at least 14 days.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The vaccine can be used during pregnancy.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy from concurrent use of this vaccine with any other.

If pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination, seek medical advice again.
To the physician:
This product contains mineral oil.
Even if small amounts have been injected, accidental injection with this product can cause intense swelling, which may, for example, result in ischaemic necrosis and even the loss of a digit.
Expert, PROMPT, surgical attention is required and may necessitate early incision and irrigation of the injected area, especially where there is involvement of finger pulp or tendon.

OTHER INFORMATION
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
The fimbrial adhesins F4ab, F4ac, F5 and F6 are responsible for the adhesion and the virulence of E. coli strains, which cause neonatal enterotoxicosis in piglets.
These immunogens are incorporated in an adjuvant in order to enhance a prolonged stimulation of immunity.
Neonatal piglets derive passive immunity via ingestion of colostrum from vaccinated sows/ gilts.
For animal treatment only.
