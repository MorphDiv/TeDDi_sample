SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1/ 17 1.
NAME OF THE VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCT
EQUIOXX 8.2 mg/ g oral paste for horses.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each syringe contains 7.32 g of paste and delivers:
Firocoxib 8.2 mg/ g
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Oral paste.
White to off-white paste.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Horses.
4.2 Indications for use specifying the target species
Alleviation of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and reduction of associated lameness in horses.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in animals suffering from gastrointestinal disorders and haemorrhage, impaired hepatic, cardiac or renal function and bleeding disorders.
Do not use in breeding, pregnant or lactating animals.
Do not use concomitantly with corticosteroids or other NSAIDs.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Do not use in animals less than 10 weeks.
If side effects occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there may be potential risk of increased renal toxicity.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.
The recommended treatment dose and duration should not be exceeded.
2/ 17 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Avoid contact with eyes and skin.
If it occurs, rinse affected area immediately with water.
Wash hands after use of the product.
Women of child-bearing age should avoid contact with, or wear disposable gloves, when administering the product.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Lesions (erosion/ ulceration) of the oral mucosa and of the skin around the mouth may occasionally be observed in treated animals.
Typically, these lesions are mild and resolve without treatment, but oral lesions may be associated with salivation and labial and tongue oedema.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
No data is available in horses.
However, studies with laboratory animals have shown embryo- foetotoxicity, malformations, delayed parturition and decreased pup survival.
Therefore, do not use in breeding, pregnant or lactating animals.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Other NSAIDs, diuretic and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and lead to toxic effects.
Do not use concomitantly with corticosteroids or other NSAIDs.
Pre-treatment with other anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and a treatment-free period with such products should therefore be observed.
The treatment- free period should take into account the pharmacological properties of the products used previously.
Concomitant treatment with molecules displaying action on renal flow (e. g. diuretics) should be subject to clinical monitoring.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided as there might be an increased risk of renal toxicity.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Oral use.
Administer 0.1 mg firocoxib per kg bodyweight, once daily.
Duration of treatment will be dependent on the response observed, but should not exceed 14 days.
To administer EQUIOXX at the dose of 0.1 mg firocoxib/ kg, set the syringe plunger to the appropriate dose division for the horse’ s weight.
Each full dose division on the syringe plunger delivers sufficient firocoxib to treat 100 kg body weight.
The contents of one syringe will treat horses weighing up to 600 kg.
To ensure correct dosage, bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid overdosing.
To deliver firocoxib at the appropriate dosage, unlock the knurled ring on the syringe plunger by rotating it ¼ turn and slide it along the plunger shaft to the appropriate dose division for the horse’ s weight.
Rotate the plunger ring ¼ turn to lock it in place and ensure it is locked.
Make sure the horse’ s mouth contains no feed.
Remove the cover from the tip of the syringe.
Insert the syringe tip into the horse’ s mouth at the interdental space and deposit the paste on the base of the tongue.
3/ 17 4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Lesions (erosion/ ulceration) of the oral mucosa and of the skin around the mouth may occasionally be observed in treated animals when administered the recommended treatment dose.
Typically, these lesions are mild and resolve without treatment, but oral lesions may be associated with salivation and labial and tongue oedema.
The incidence of oral/ skin lesions increases with increasing dose.
At high dosages and prolonged treatment (3 times the recommended dose for 42 consecutive days and 2.5 times the recommended dose for 92 consecutive days administered once daily) mild to moderate renal lesions were observed.
If clinical signs occur, treatment should be discontinued and symptomatic treatment initiated.
4.11 Withdrawal period
Meat and offal:
26 days Do not use in mares producing milk for human consumption.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products, non-steroids, ATC vet code:
QM01AH90.
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Firocoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) belonging to the Coxib group, which acts by selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-mediated prostaglandin synthesis.
Cyclooxygenase is responsible for generation of prostaglandins.
COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme that has been shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and has been postulated to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever.
Coxibs therefore display analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.
COX-2 is also thought to be involved in ovulation, implantation and closure of the ductus arteriosus, and central nervous system functions (fever induction, pain perception, and cognitive function). “ In “ in vitro” equine whole blood assays, firocoxib exhibits 222 to 643 fold selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1.
The concentration of firocoxib required to inhibit 50% of the COX-2 enzyme (i. e., the IC50) is 0.0369 to 0.12 µM, whereas the IC50 for COX-1 is 20.14 to 33.1 µM.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Following oral administration in horses at the recommended dose of 0.1 mg per kg of bodyweight, firocoxib is rapidly absorbed, and the time to maximal concentration (Tmax) is 3.9 (± 4.4) hours.
The peak concentration (Cmax) is 0.075 (± 0.033) µg/ ml (equivalent to approximately 0.223 µM), area under the curve (AUC0-24) is 0.96 (± 0.26) µg x hr/ ml, and oral bioavailability is 79 (± 31) percent.
The elimination half-life (t½) after a single dose is 29.6 (± 7.5) hours and 50.6 hours after 14 days of dosing.
Firocoxib is approximately 97% bound to plasma proteins.
Following multiple oral administrations, the steady state is reached by approximately the eighth daily dose.
Firocoxib is metabolised predominantly by dealkylation and glucuronidation in the liver.
Elimination is principally in the excreta (primarily the urine), with some biliary excretion also observed.
