To enable Sybase-DB support configure PHP --with-sybase[ =DIR].
DIR is the Sybase home directory, defaults to / home / sybase.
To enable Sybase-CT support configure PHP --with-sybase-ct[ =DIR].
DIR is the Sybase home directory, defaults to / home / sybase.
The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini.
Table 1.

sybase.allow_persistent

Here is a short explanation of the configuration directives.
Whether to allow persistent Sybase connections.
The maximum number of persistent Sybase connections per process. -1 means no limit.
The maximum number of Sybase connections per process, including persistent connections. -1 means no limit.
Minimum error severity to display.
Minimum message severity to display.
Compatability mode with old versions of PHP 3.0.
If on, this will cause PHP to automatically assign types to results according to their Sybase type, instead of treating them all as strings.
This compatability mode will probably not stay around forever, so try applying whatever necessary changes to your code, and turn it off.
If magic_quotes_sybase is on, a single-quote is escaped with a single-quote instead of a backslash if magic_quotes_gpc or magic_quotes_runtime are enabled.
Note:
Note that when magic_quotes_sybase is ON it completely overrides magic_quotes_gpc.
In this case even when magic_quotes_gpc is enabled neither double quotes, backslashes or NUL 's will be escaped.

Here is a short explanation of the configuration directives.
Whether to allow persistent Sybase-CT connections.
The default is on.
The maximum number of persistent Sybase-CT connections per process.
The default is -1 meaning unlimited.
The maximum number of Sybase-CT connections per process, including persistent connections.
The default is -1 meaning unlimited.
Server messages with severity greater than or equal to sybct.min_server_severity will be reported as warnings.
This value can also be set from a script by calling sybase_min_server_severity().
The default is 10 which reports errors of information severity or greater.
Client library messages with severity greater than or equal to sybct.min_client_severity will be reported as warnings.
This value can also be set from a script by calling sybase_min_client_severity().
The default is 10 which effectively disables reporting.
The name of the host you claim to be connecting from, for display by sp_who.
The default is none.
For further details and definition of the PHP_INI_* constants see ini_set().
This extension has no constants defined.
