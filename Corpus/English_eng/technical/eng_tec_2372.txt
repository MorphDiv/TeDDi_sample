(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
Searches haystack for needle and returns the key if it is found in the array, FALSE otherwise.
Note:
Prior to PHP 4.2.0, array_search() returns NULL on failure instead of FALSE.
If the optional third parameter strict is set to TRUE then the array_search() will also check the types of the needle in the haystack.
Warning
This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0 or "".
Please read the section on Booleans for more information.
Use the === operator for testing the return value of this function.
See also array_keys() and in_array().
