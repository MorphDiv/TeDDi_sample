EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
PROFENDER
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Profender?
Profender is an antiparasitic medicine that contains two active substances, emodepside and praziquantel.
Profender is available as a clear yellow to brownish solution for use on cats, and as modified release tablets for dogs.
Modified-release means that the tablets release their active substances over a few hours.
Profender solution is packed as spot-on pipettes, which are already filled with the correct amount of Profender needed to treat one cat (3 size of pipettes for different cat weights) and as a multidose bottle for use only in a veterinary surgery, where the vet will measure the exact volume of Profender needed for each cat before application.
Profender tablets are bone-shaped, and available in three different strengths to cover a range of dog weights (small, medium or large dogs).
The tablets have a break-line.
What is Profender used for?
Profender is used to treat cats and dogs that have, or are at risk of catching, “ mixed” (caused by more than one parasite) parasitic infections.
Profender works for infections caused by certain types of roundworms and tapeworms.
Profender is given as a single treatment.
Cats are treated using the Profender spot-on solution range.
The appropriate quantity of Profender (either the contents of one full pipette or the volume measured by the vet) is applied onto the cat ’ s skin, after parting the fur on the back of its neck at the base of its head.
Dogs are treated using Profender modified-release tablets, which are given by mouth when the dog is fasting.
The correct number of tablets or half tablets to use is calculated based on the dog’ s weight.
How does Profender work?
The two active substances in Profender interact with different parts of the parasites systems.
Emodepside interferes with certain specific receptors in the nervous systems of roundworms, which results in their subsequent paralysis and death.
Praziquantel damages the skin-like outer layer of tapeworms, leading to their paralysis and death.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged How has Profender been studied?
Data were provided on the pharmaceutical quality, the tolerance of the products in cats and dogs, the safety in humans (people in contact with the product) and the safety to the environment.
The effectiveness of each of the products against the specified roundworms and tapeworms was investigated in both laboratory studies and in large field studies (one for the spot-on for cats and another for the tablets for dogs) carried out at several different places across Europe.
In each of the field studies, animals of various breeds, age groups and different weights that were naturally infected with parasitic gastrointestinal roundworms or tapeworms, were treated either with Profender or another medicine which is authorised in the European Union for this indication.
The comparator was selamectin in cats, and milbemycin oxime and praziquantel in dogs.
The effectiveness was measured by looking at the number of worm eggs or parts of tapeworms passed out in the animal’ s faeces after treatment.
What benefit has Profender shown during the studies?
The results from the laboratory studies and from the field studies, in both cats and dogs, showed that Profender is as effective as the comparator medicine.
Over 90% of cats and 99% of dogs have no roundworm or tapeworm infection after treatment with Profender.
What is the risk associated with Profender?
In cats, in very rare cases, the cat might salivate or vomit after treatment.
This is thought to occur as a result of the cat licking the application site straight after treatment.
In very rare cases there might also be some temporary itchiness, inflammation or hair loss at the place where the product has been applied to the cat ’ s skin.
These signs disappear without further treatment.
No side effects have been reported in dogs.
Profender should not be used in young animals (cats under 8 weeks of age or weighing less than 0.5 kg, or puppies under 12 weeks of age or weighing less than 1 kg).
As with other products of this type, Profender should be used on sick or ill cats or dogs only after a risk-benefit assessment by the vet.
Profender should not be used for any other animal species.
Profender should not be allowed to enter surface water, as it may be harmful for aquatic organisms.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
Spot-on for Cats:
As a precautionary measure, skin contact with the pipette contents should be avoided and animals should not be stroked, groomed or allow to groom each other, until the application site is dry.
Frequent users of the product (for example, professional cat breeders) and women who are or could be pregnant, are advised to wear disposable gloves when using the product.
When administering Profender, users should not smoke, eat or drink, and should wash their hands thoroughly after use.
If accidental exposure occurs, the eyes should be rinsed with water or the skin washed with soap and water.
The solvent in Profender may stain certain materials including leather, fabrics, plastics and finished surfaces, so contact between the product and such surfaces should be avoided.

Users should wash their hands after administering the tablets to the dog.
Why has Profender been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of Profender exceed the risks for cats or dogs suffering from, or at risk from, mixed parasitic infections, and recommended that Profender be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit- risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about Profender:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Profender to Bayer HealthCare AG (now Bayer Animal Health GmbH) on 27 July 2005.
Information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the outer package.
