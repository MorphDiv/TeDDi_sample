EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
THYMANAX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Thymanax?
Thymanax is a medicine that contains the active substance agomelatine.
It is available as orange- yellow, oblong tablets (25 mg).
What is Thymanax used for?
Thymanax is used to treat major depression in adults.
Major depression is a condition in which patients have mood disturbances that interfere with their everyday life.
Symptoms often include deep sadness, feelings of worthlessness, loss of interest in favourite activities, sleep disturbances, a feeling of being slowed down, feelings of anxiety and changes in weight.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Thymanax used?
The recommended dose of Thymanax is one tablet once a day, taken at bedtime with or without food.
If there is no improvement in symptoms after two weeks, the doctor may increase the dose to two tablets taken together at bedtime.
Patients with depression should be treated for at least six months to make sure that they are free of symptoms.
The patient’ s liver should be checked with blood tests when treatment starts, and then after around six, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment The liver should also be checked if the patient develops symptoms that could indicate liver problems.
Treatment should be interrupted in patients with abnormal liver enzyme levels in the blood.
Blood tests should then be repeated until the liver enzymes have returned to normal levels.
Because a benefit of Thymanax has not been shown clearly in patients aged over 65 years, it should be used with caution in this age group.
It should also be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe kidney problems.
It must not be used in patients who have liver problems.
How does Thymanax work?
The active substance in Thymanax, agomelatine, is an antidepressant.
It works in two ways, both by stimulating the MT1 and MT2 receptors, which are normally activated by melatonin, and also by blocking the 5-HT 2C receptors, which are normally activated by the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).
This is thought to lead to increases in the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline between nerve cells in the areas of the brain that are involved in the

This is believed to help relieve the symptoms of depression.
Thymanax might also help to normalise the patient ’ s sleep patterns.
How has Thymanax been studied?
The effects of Thymanax were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
Thymanax has been compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) in five main short-term studies involving a total of 1,893 adults with major depression.
Three of these studies included some patients treated with other antidepressants, either fluoxetine or paroxetine, as an ‘ active comparator’.
The active comparator groups were included to check that the study was able to measure the effectiveness of medicines in treating depression.
The main measure of effectiveness in these five studies was the change in symptoms after six weeks, as measured on a standard scale for depression called the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).
The company also presented the results of a further study comparing Thymanax with sertraline (another antidepressant).
Two other main studies compared the ability of Thymanax and placebo to prevent symptoms returning in 706 patients whose depression had already been controlled with Thymanax.
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose symptoms returned during 24 to 26 weeks of treatment.
What benefit has Thymanax shown during the studies?
In the short-term studies, Thymanax was seen to be more effective than placebo in the two studies where no active comparator was used.
In the other three studies, which did include an active comparator, there were no differences in scores between the patients taking Thymanax and those taking placebo.
However, no effect of fluoxetine or paroxetine was seen in two of these studies, making the results difficult to interpret.
The additional study showed that agomelatine was more effective than sertraline, with a difference in HAM-D scores of 1.68 after six weeks.
In the first of the long-term studies, there was no difference between Thymanax and placebo in preventing symptoms returning during 26 weeks of treatment.
However, the second study showed that symptoms returned in 21% of the patients taking Thymanax over 24 weeks (34 out of 165), compared with 41% of the patients taking placebo (72 out of 174).
What is the risk associated with Thymanax?
The most common side effects with Thymanax (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, dizziness, somnolence (sleepiness), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), migraine, nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, constipation, upper abdominal pain (tummy ache), hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), back pain, fatigue (tiredness), increases in liver enzymes and anxiety.
Most side effects were mild or moderate in intensity and happened within the first two weeks of treatment.
Some of these side effects may be linked to the patient’ s depression rather than Thymanax itself.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Thymanax, see the Package Leaflet.
Thymanax should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to agomelatine or any of the other ingredients.
It must not be used in patients who have problems with their liver, such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or active liver disease.
It must also not be used in patients who are taking medicines that slow down the breakdown of Thymanax in the body, such as fluvoxamine (another antidepressant) and ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic).
Thymanax should not be used in elderly patients with dementia.
Why has Thymanax been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Thymanax’ s benefits in terms of treating depression might be lower than seen with other antidepressants.
However, since the medicine has a new mode of action, few side effects and a different safety profile to existing antidepressants, the Committee concluded that Thymanax could be a valuable treatment for some patients as long as their liver function is tested frequently.
Therefore, the CHMP decided that Thymanax’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults.
The Committee recommended that Thymanax be given marketing authorisation.
2/ 3 Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Thymanax?
The company that makes Thymanax will supply educational material for prescribers of Thymanax when it is launched.
This material will explain the safety of the medicine, particularly its possible effects on the liver and its interactions with other medicines.

The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Thymanax to Servier (Ireland) Industries Ltd on 19 February 2009.
