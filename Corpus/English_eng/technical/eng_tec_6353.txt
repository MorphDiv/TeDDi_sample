Window Behavior Here you can customize the way windows behave when being moved, resized or clicked on. You can also specify a focus policy as well as a placement policy for new windows. Please note that this configuration will not take effect if you do not use KWin as your window manager. If you do use a different window manager, please refer to its documentation for how to customize window behavior.

None
Low
Medium
High
Extreme
This option specifies how much KWin will try to prevent unwanted focus stealing caused by unexpected activation of new windows. (Note: This feature does not work with the Focus Under Mouse or Focus Strictly Under Mouse focus policies.) None: Prevention is turned off and new windows always become activated. Low: Prevention is enabled; when some window does not have support for the underlying mechanism and KWin cannot reliably decide whether to activate the window or not, it will be activated. This setting may have both worse and better results than the medium level, depending on the applications. Medium: Prevention is enabled. High: New windows get activated only if no window is currently active or if they belong to the currently active application. This setting is probably not really usable when not using mouse focus policy. Extreme: All windows must be explicitly activated by the user. Windows that are prevented from stealing focus are marked as demanding attention, which by default means their taskbar entry will be highlighted. This can be changed in the Notifications control module.
Focus stealing prevention level:
Click to Focus
Focus Follows Mouse
Focus Under Mouse
Focus Strictly Under Mouse
& Policy:
The focus policy is used to determine the active window, i. e. the window you can work in. Click to focus: A window becomes active when you click into it. This is the behavior you might know from other operating systems. Focus follows mouse: Moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it. New windows will receive the focus, without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. Very practical if you are using the mouse a lot. Focus under mouse: The window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, the last window that was under the mouse has focus. New windows will not automatically receive the focus. Focus strictly under mouse: Only the window under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has focus. Note that'Focus under mouse 'and'Focus strictly under mouse' prevent certain features such as the Alt+Tab walk through windows dialog in the KDE mode from working properly.
ms
& Raise, with the following delay:
Delay focus by:
Click raises active window
When this option is enabled, a window in the background will automatically come to the front when the mouse pointer has been over it for some time.
This is the delay after which the window that the mouse pointer is over will automatically come to the front.
When this option is enabled, the active window will be brought to the front when you click somewhere into the window contents. To change it for inactive windows, you need to change the settings in the Actions tab.
When this option is enabled, there will be a delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will become active (receive focus).
This is the delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will automatically receive focus.
Separate screen focus
When this option is enabled, focus operations are limited only to the active Xinerama screen
Active screen follows & mouse
When this option is enabled, the active Xinerama screen (where new windows appear, for example) is the screen containing the mouse pointer. When disabled, the active Xinerama screen is the screen containing the focused window. By default this option is disabled for Click to focus and enabled for other focus policies.
Shading
& Enable hover
If Shade Hover is enabled, a shaded window will un-shade automatically when the mouse pointer has been over the title bar for some time.
Sets the time in milliseconds before the window unshades when the mouse pointer goes over the shaded window.
Delay:
Window Tabbing
Hide inactive window tabs from the taskbar
When turned on hide all tabs that are not active from the taskbar.
Automatically group similar windows
When turned on attempt to automatically detect when a newly opened window is related to an existing one and place them in the same window group.
Switch to automatically grouped windows immediately
When turned on immediately switch to any new window tabs that were automatically added to the current group.
Smart
Maximizing
Cascade
Random
Centered
Zero-Cornered
The placement policy determines where a new window will appear on the desktop. Smart will try to achieve a minimum overlap of windows Maximizing will try to maximize every window to fill the whole screen. It might be useful to selectively affect placement of some windows using the window-specific settings. Cascade will cascade the windows Random will use a random position Centered will place the window centered Zero-Cornered will place the window in the top-left corner
& Placement:
Hide utility windows for inactive applications
When turned on, utility windows (tool windows, torn-off menus,...) of inactive applications will be hidden and will be shown only when the application becomes active. Note that applications have to mark the windows with the proper window type for this feature to work.
Windows
Display content in moving windows
Enable this option if you want a window's content to be fully shown while moving it, instead of just showing a window'skeleton '. The result may not be satisfying on slow machines without graphic acceleration.
Display content in & resizing windows
Enable this option if you want a window's content to be shown while resizing it, instead of just showing a window'skeleton '. The result may not be satisfying on slow machines.
Display window & geometry when moving or resizing
Enable this option if you want a window's geometry to be displayed while it is being moved or resized. The window position relative to the top-left corner of the screen is displayed together with its size.
Allow moving and resizing of maximized windows
When enabled, this feature activates the border of maximized windows and allows you to move or resize them, just like for normal windows
Snap Zones
none
Here you can set the snap zone for screen borders, i. e. the'strength 'of the magnetic field which will make windows snap to the border when moved near it.
& Border snap zone:
Here you can set the snap zone for windows, i. e. the'strength 'of the magnetic field which will make windows snap to each other when they are moved near another window.
& Window snap zone:
Here you can set the snap zone for the screen center, i. e. the'strength 'of the magnetic field which will make windows snap to the center of the screen when moved near it.
& Center snap zone:
Snap windows only when overlapping
Here you can set that windows will be only snapped if you try to overlap them, i. e. they will not be snapped if the windows comes only near another window or border.
Show window list while switching windows
Hold down the Alt key and press the Tab key repeatedly to walk through the windows on the current desktop (the Alt+Tab combination can be reconfigured). If this checkbox is checked a popup widget is shown, displaying the icons of all windows to walk through and the title of the currently selected one. Otherwise, the focus is passed to a new window each time Tab is pressed, with no popup widget. In addition, the previously activated window will be sent to the back in this mode.
& Traverse windows on all desktops
Leave this option disabled if you want to limit walking through windows to the current desktop.
Desktop navigation wraps around
Enable this option if you want keyboard or active desktop border navigation beyond the edge of a desktop to take you to the opposite edge of the new desktop.
Popup desktop name on desktop & switch
Enable this option if you wish to see the current desktop name popup whenever the current desktop is changed.
Normal
Active Desktop Borders
If this option is enabled, moving the mouse to a screen border will change your desktop. This is e. g. useful if you want to drag windows from one desktop to the other.
Disabled
Only & when moving windows
Always enabled
Here you can set a delay for switching desktops using the active borders feature. Desktops will be switched after the mouse has been pushed against a screen border for the specified number of milliseconds.

& Translucency
It seems that alpha channel support is not available. Please make sure you have Xorg & ge; 6.8, and have installed the kompmgr that came with kwin. Also, make sure you have the following entries in your XConfig (e. g. / etc/ X11/ xorg. conf): Section "Extensions" Option "Composite" "Enable" EndSection And if your GPU provides hardware-accelerated Xrender support (mainly nVidia cards): Option "RenderAccel" "true" In Section "Device"
