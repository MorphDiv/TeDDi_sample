Texture properties
Type



Determines the type of action on the sphere.
Texture
Determines the pattern used by the texture type. If the texture applies to light then the light is distorted by this texture as if it was going through this texture before falling onto the sphere. If the texture applies to the texture itself, the texture is applied directly to the sphere. The following options are available:
Colors
Sets the two colors to be used for a texture. By pressing the color button a color selection dialog appears.
Scale
Determines the size of separate elements composing the texture. For example, for the
Turbulence
Determines the degree of texture distortion before applying the texture to the sphere. Value range is from 0 to 10. With values of up to 1.0 you can still make out the undistorted patterns; beyond that the texture gradually turns into noise.
Amount
Determines the degree of influence the texture has on the final result. Value range is from 0 to 1. With the value of 0 the texture does not affect the result.
Exponent
With the Wood texture, this options gives an aspect of venetian blind, more or less open.
Texture Transformations
Scale X/Y/Z
Determines the degree of stretching/compression of the texture on the sphere along the three directions. The value range is from 0 to 10.
Rotate X/Y/Z
Determines the amount of a turn of the texture on the sphere around the three axes. The value range is from 0 to 360.
Position X/Y/Z
Determines the position of the texture relative to the sphere. When type is Light, this parameter refers to the position of the light floodlighting the sphere.

If you check this, you'll get very interesting effects, often something that looks much like oil on water, or clouds of smoke, or living tissue, or a Rorschach blot.
Detail
This controls the amount of detail in the noise texture. Higher values give a higher level of detail, and the noise seems to be made of spray or small particles, which makes it feel hard. A low value makes it more soft and cloudy.
Tileable
If you check Tileable, you'll get a noise which can be used as tiles. For example, you can use it as a background in an HTML page, and the tile edges will be joined seamlessly.
X and Y Size
These control the size and proportion of the noise shapes in X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) directions (range 0.1 to 16.0).

The Sinus filter lets you make sinusoidally based textures, which look rather like watered silk or maybe plywood. This plug-in works by using two different colors that you can define in the Colors tab. These two colors then create wave patterns based on a sine function.
You can set the X and Y scales, which determine how stretched or packed the texture will be. You can also set the Complexity of the function: a high value creates more interference or repetition in the pattern. An example is shown below.

Settings tab
X and Y Scales
A low X/Y value will maximize the horizontal/vertical stretch of the texture, whereas a high value will compress it.
Complexity
This controls how the two colors interact with each other (the amount of interplay or repetition).

Force Tiling?
If you check this, you'll get a pattern that can be used for tiling. For example, you can use it as a background in an HTML page, and the tile edges will be joined seamlessly.
Ideal/Distorted
This option gives additional control of the interaction between the two colors. Distorted creates a more distorted interference between the two colors than Ideal.

Here, you set the two colors that make up your texture. You can use Black and white or the foreground/background colors in the toolbox, or you can choose a color with the color icons. The

Gradient
You can choose between three functions to set the shapes of the waves that are produced: Linear, Bilinear and Sinusoidal.
The Exponent controls which of the two colors is dominant, and how dominant it is. If you set the exponent to -7.5, the left color will dominate totally, and if you set it to +7.5 it will be the other way around. A zero value is neutral.

IFS Fractal
Fractal Composition
Applying example for the IFS Compose filter
Filter
This fractal-based plug-in is truly wonderful! With this versatile instrument, you can create amazingly naturalistic organic shapes, like leaves, flowers, branches, or even whole trees. (
The key to use this plug-in lies in making very small and precise movements in fractal space. The outcome is always hard to predict, and you have to be extremely gentle when you change the pattern. If you make a component triangle too big, or if you move it too far (even ever so slightly), the preview screen will black out, or more commonly, you'll get stuck with a big shapeless particle cloud.
A word of advice: When you have found a pattern you want to work with, make only small changes, and stick to variations of that pattern. It's all too easy to lose a good thing. Contrary to what you might believe, it's really much easier to create a leaf or a tree with IFS Compose than to make a defined geometrical pattern (where you actually know what you're doing, and end up with the pattern you had in mind).
For a brief introduction to IFS's see Foley and van Dam, et al,.
This filter is found in the image window menu under

The Main Interface
The plug-in interface consists of the compose area to the left, a preview screen to the right, and some tabs and option buttons at the bottom of the dialog. The Default setting (in the preview window) is three equilateral triangles. (This gives rise to a fractal pattern called the

A Brief Tutorial
This is a rather complex plug-in, so to help you understand it, we'll guide you through an example where you'll create a leaf or branch.
Many forms of life, and especially plants, are built like mathematical fractals, i.e., a shape that reproduces or repeats itself indefinitely into the smallest detail. You can easily reproduce the shape of a leaf or a branch by using four (or more) fractals. Three fractals make up the tip and sides of the leaf, and the fourth represents the stem.
Before invoking the filter: Select
Open IFS Compose. Start by rotating the right and bottom triangles, so that they point upward. You'll now be able to see the outline of what's going to be the tip and sides of the leaf. (If you have problems, it may help to know that the three vertices of a triangle are not equivalent.)
Tutorial Step 2
Start by rotating triangles 2 and 3, trying to keep them nearly the same size.
To make the leaf symmetrical, adjust the bottom triangle to point slightly to the left, and the right triangle to point slightly to the right.
Press
Tutorial Step 3
Add a fourth component, then stretch, scale, and move it as shown.
You still have to make it look more leaf-like. Increase the size of the top triangle, until you think it's thick and leafy enough. Adjust all fractals until you're happy with the shape. Right-click to get the pop-up menu, and choose
Tutorial Step 4
Enlarge component 1, arrange the other components appropriately, then select all, scale and rotate.
The final step is to adjust color. Click on the
Tutorial Step 5
Assign a brownish color to component 4, and various shades of green to the other components.
Press OK to apply the image, and voilà, you've just made a perfect fractal leaf! Now that you've got the hang of it, you'll just have to experiment and make your own designs. All plant-imitating fractals (be they oak trees, ferns or straws) are more or less made in this fashion, which is leaves around a stem (or several stems). You just have to twist another way, stretch and turn a little or add a few more fractals to get a totally different plant.

The result of these options is visible in the Preview window, but it's generally better to stick to the default values, and correct the rendered image later with Image/Colors.
The other three parameters affect the rendering process and don't show in the preview window. Sample Density, which controls the resolution of the rendered pattern, is the most important of these.

This is a very useful filter if you want to create intricate patterns. It's perfect for making psychedelic, batik-like textures, or for imitating patterns in stained glass (as in a church window).
It seems clear that the plugin works by simulating the physics of light striking a grating. Unfortunately, the original authors never got around to writing down the theory behind it, or explaining what the parameters mean. The best approach, then, is just to twiddle things and see what happens. Fortunately, almost anything you do seems to produce interesting results.
