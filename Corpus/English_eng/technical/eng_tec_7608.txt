EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
NAXCEL
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Naxcel?
Naxcel is an antibiotic suspension that contains ceftiofur (as ceftiofur crystalline free acid) as the active substance.
It is given by injection into the muscle.
What is Naxcel used for?
Naxcel is used to treat pigs that have an infection caused by specific groups of bacteria.
These infections can be respiratory tract infections (such as lung infections), infections of the joints and infections affecting the general health of the pigs (septicaemia,).
How does Naxcel work?
The active substance in Naxcel is ceftiofur, which belongs to a class of antibiotics called “ third generation cephalosporins”.
All these cephalosporin antibiotics, including ceftiofur, kill bacteria by disrupting the building of the bacterial cell walls.
Like other antibiotics, ceftiofur is only effective against certain types of bacteria.
Naxcel differs from other similar cephalosporin antibiotics as it stays in the pig’ s body for a longer time after it has been injected.
How has Naxcel been studied?
Data from laboratory studies with different bacteria showed that ceftiofur was effective against those bacteria involved in causing pig diseases as specified in the product information (see SPC and package leaflet).
Naxcel has also been investigated in pigs with respiratory diseases (caused by various bacterial species) or in pigs suffering from severe lameness, fever or other clinical signs of septicaemia, polyarthritis or polyserositis associated with Streptococcus suis infections.
In these trials, Naxcel was either used on its own or compared with another authorised antibiotic (ceftiofur sodium) or a placebo (a dummy treatment without any active ingredient).

In all studies, Naxcel was as effective in curing the infection as the comparator antibiotic.
Naxcel has the benefit of a long duration of activity.
What is the risk associated with Naxcel?
The most common side effects noted during the studies are local swellings and/ or other mild reactions (skin discolouration, small cysts) at the injection site.
These effects disappear after a few weeks and do not require any further treatment.
Ceftiofur (as other cephalosporins or penicillins) may cause allergic reaction in humans or in animals, which may occasionally be serious.
It should therefore not be used in pigs, which have shown an allergy to any cephalosporin or penicillin-type antibiotics.
As no studies have been made in pregnant or lactating sows or in breeding pigs and Naxcel has an exceptionally long duration in the body, Naxcel should only be used in these animals after careful consideration by the veterinarian.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
Cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics can cause allergies in humans, and sometimes these allergies can be very serious.
Naxcel should therefore not be handled by anyone who is hypersensitive (allergic) to such antibiotics, or by anyone who has been advised not to work with them.
Naxcel should be handled with care and all the recommended precautions be taken to avoid exposure to the product.
If any symptoms occur after accidental exposure to Naxcel, for example a skin rash, then the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately.
Swelling of the face, lips or eyes, or any difficulty breathing are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.
What is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption (withdrawal period)?
The withdrawal period of the product is 71 days.
Why has Naxcel been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of Naxcel outweigh its risks, for the treatment of pigs with specified bacterial respiratory diseases or the treatment of septicaemia, polyarthritis and polyserositis associated with Streptococcus suis infection.
The Committee, therefore, recommended that Naxcel should be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about Naxcel:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Naxcel to Pfizer Ltd on 19 May 2005.
Information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label/ outer package.
