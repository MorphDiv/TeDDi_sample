& kde; Help System User Manual
& kde; Help System
The & kde; help system is designed to make accessing the common & UNIX; help systems (man and info) simple, as well as the native & kde; documentation (XML;).
All base & kde; applications come fully documented, thanks to the efforts of the Documentation team. If you are interested in helping with the documentation efforts, join the mailing list and write to the team at kde-doc-english@kde. org. No experience is required, just enthusiasm and patience.
If you would like to help translating & kde; documentation to your native language, review the information, including coordinators for each language team, on the Localization web site, and in the Contact section of this document.
Installation
& khelpcenter; is an integral part of the & kde; Base installation, and is installed with every copy of & kde;. It can be found in the kdebase-runtime package, and is available from the & kde-ftp;, or will be found in your operating system's kdebase-runtime package.
Invoking Help
& khelpcenter; can be called in several ways:
From the Help menu
The most common will probably be from within an application. Choose F1 Help Applicationapos; s Handbook to open that application's handbook.
From the Kickoff Application Launcher
Choose the big K in your panel, and select the Applications tab followed by selecting Help to open & khelpcenter;, which will open up to the default welcome page.
From the command line
& khelpcenter; may be started using a & URL; to display a file. & URL; s have been added for info and man pages also. You can use them as follows:
An application help file
khelpcenter help: / kedit
Opens the & kedit; help file, at the contents page.
A local & URL;
khelpcenter file: / usr/ local/ src/ qt/ html/ index. html
A Man page
khelpcenter man: / strcpy
An Info page
khelpcenter info: / gcc
Invoking khelpcenter with no parameters opens the default welcome page.
The & khelpcenter; interface
The & khelpcenter; interface consists of two panes of information.
The toolbar and menus are explained further in.
Documents contain their own navigation tools, enabling you to move either sequentially through a document, using Next, Previous, and Home links, or to move around in a less structured manner, using hyperlinks.
Links can take you to other parts of the same document, or to a different document, and you can use the Back (Left pointing arrow) or Forward (Right pointing arrow) icons on the toolbar to move through the documents you have viewed in this session.
The two panes display the contents of the help system, and the help files themselves, on the left and right respectively.
The Contents pane
The Contents pane in & khelpcenter; is displayed on the left hand side of the window. As you might expect, you can move the splitter bar, to make sure you can comfortably read the contents of either pane.
The Contents pane is further divided into two tabs, one containing a menu showing all the help information & khelpcenter; is aware of, and the other contains the & kde; glossary of terms.
The Contents Menu
The Contents contains the following default entries:
Welcome to & kde;
Contains links that provide Information about & kde; as well as Getting the most out of & kde;.
& kde; User's manual
The & kde; User's manual is an in-depth exploration of & kde;, including installation, configuration and customization, and use.
Application manuals
Native & kde; application documentation. All & kde; applications have documentation in & XML; format, which are converted to HTML when you view them. This section lists all the & kde; applications with a brief description and a link to the full application documentation.
The applications are displayed in a tree structure that echoes the default structure of the K menu, making it easy to find the application you are looking for.
Control Center Modules
Provides a list of links to various modules that are located in the & kde; & systemsettings; application.
Kioslaves
Contains a list of links to various KIO modules documentation.
Plasma Manual
The & plasma; Manual is the documentation for the most visible pillar of & kde;, the core interface to the desktop.
Tutorials
Short, task based or informational tutorials.
& UNIX; manual pages
& UNIX; man pages are the traditional on-line documentation format for & UNIX; systems. Most programs on your system will have a man page. In addition, man pages exist for programming functions and file formats.
Browse info pages
TeXinfo documentation is used by many & GNU; applications, including gcc (the C/ C++ compiler), emacs, and many others.
The & kde; FAQ
Frequently asked questions about & kde;, and their answers.
Contact Information
Information on how to contact & kde; developers, and how to join the & kde; mailing lists.
& kde; on the web
Links to & kde; on the web, both the official & kde; website, and other useful sites.
Supporting & kde;
How to help, and how to get involved.
The Man and Info sections
Man pages are the standard & UNIX; manual pages, and have been in use for many years on many operating systems. They are extremely thorough, and are the very best place to get information about most & UNIX; commands and applications. When people say RTFM, the Manual they are referring to is very often the man page.
The man pages are not perfect. They tend to be in depth, but also extremely technical, often written by developers, and for developers. In some cases this makes them somewhat unfriendly, if not downright impossible for many users to understand. They are, however, the best source of solid information on most command line applications, and very often the only source.
If you've ever wondered what the number is when people write things like man(1) it means which section of the manual the item is in. You will see & khelpcenter; uses the numbers to divide the very many man pages into their own sections, making it easier for you to find the information you're looking for, if you're just browsing.
Also available are the Info pages, intended to be a replacement for the man pages. The maintainer of some applications no longer update the man pages, so if there is both a man page and an info page available, the info page is probably the most recent. Most applications have one or the other though. If the application you are looking for help on is a & GNU; utility, you will most likely find it has an info page, not a man page.
Navigating inside the Info pages
Info documents are arranged hierarchically with each page called a node. All info documents have a Top node, & ie; the opening page. You can return to the Top of an info document by pressing Top.
Prev & Next are used to move to the previous/ next page at the current level of the hierarchy.
Clicking on a menu item within a document moves you to a lower level in the hierarchy. You may move up the hierarchy by pressing Up.
Man is treated similarly to info, with the section index being the Top node and each man page on the level below. Man entries are one page long.
The & kde; glossary
The glossary provides a quick reference point, where you can look up the definitions of words that may be unfamiliar to you. These range from & kde; specific applications and technologies, through to general & UNIX; computing terms.
In the left hand pane you will see a tree view, with two choices: Alphabetically or By topic. Both contain the same entries, sorted differently, to allow you to quickly find the item of interest.
Navigate down the tree views to the left, and items you select will be displayed on the right.
The menus and toolbar
& khelpcenter; has a very minimal interface, allowing you to concentrate on getting help rather than learning how to use the help browser.
The icons available to you in the toolbar are as follows:
Toolbar Icons
Table of Contents
Go to the main welcome page of & khelpcenter;.

Go to the previous page you viewed.

Ctrl; A Edit

Go Forward
If you have previously moved back with the back icon or menu entry, you can work your way forward again with this menu entry.
