Data
Data
tab page allows you to assign a data source to the selected control.
Form Properties
.
You will find the functions for this on the
Data
tab page.
Data
tab page of a control depend on the respective control.
You will only see the options that are available for the current control and context.
The following fields are available:
Reference value (off)
Check boxes and radio buttons in Spreadsheets can be bound to cells in the current document.
If the control is enabled, the value you enter in Reference value (on) is copied to the cell.
If the control is disabled, the value from Reference value (off) is copied to the cell.
Reference value (on)
You can enter a reference value for the web form, which will be remitted to a server when sending the form.
With database forms, the value entered is written in the database field, assigned to the control field.
You can assign a reference value to option buttons and check boxes.
The reference value will be remitted to a server when sending the web form.
With database forms the value entered here will be written in the database assigned to the control field.
Reference values for Web forms
Reference values are useful if you design a Web form and the information on the status of the control is to be transmitted to a server.
If the control is clicked by the user, the corresponding reference value is sent to the server.
For example, if you have two control fields for the options &quot; feminine &quot; and &quot; masculine &quot; , and assign a reference value of 1 to the field &quot; feminine &quot; and the value 2 to the &quot; masculine &quot; field, the value 1 is transmitted to the server if a user clicks the &quot; feminine &quot; field and value 2 is sent if the &quot; masculine &quot; field is clicked.
Reference values for database forms
For database forms, you can also characterise the status of an option or a check box by a reference value, storing it in the database.
If you have a set of three options, for example &quot; in progress &quot; , &quot; completed &quot; , and &quot; resubmission &quot; , with the respective reference values, &quot; ToDo &quot; , &quot; OK &quot; , and &quot; RS &quot; , these reference values appear in the database if the respective option is clicked.
Data field
Specifies the field of the data source table to which the control refers.
With database forms, you can link controls with the data fields.
You have several possibilities:
First case:
There is only one table in the form.
Data field
, specify the field of the data source table whose contents you want to be displayed.
Second case:
The control belongs to a sub-form that is created by an SQL query.
Data field
, specify the field of the SQL statement whose contents you want to be displayed.
Combo Boxes
Data field
.
The values displayed in the list of the combo box are based on an SQL statement, which is entered under
List content
.
List Boxes
The data source table does not contain the data to be displayed, but rather a table linked to the data source table through a common data field.
Data field
specify the field of the data source table to which the content of the list box refers.
Or you can specify the database field that controls the display of the data in the form.
This data field provides the link to the other table if both tables can be linked through a common data field.
It is usually a data field in which unique identification numbers are stored.
The data field whose contents are displayed in the form is specified by an SQL statement under
List content
.
List boxes work with references.
They can either be implemented with linked tables by SQL statements (fourth case) or through value lists:
References through linked tables (SQL statements)
Data field
.
Type of list contents
in the field
List content
.
As an example, a table &quot; Orders &quot; is linked to the current form control, and in the database a table &quot; Customers &quot; is linked to the &quot; Orders &quot; table.
You can use an SQL statement as follows:
SELECT CustomerName, CustomerNo FROM Customers,
Data field
.
References Using Value Lists
For list boxes, you can use value lists.
Value lists are lists that define reference values.
In this way, the control in the form does not directly display the content of a database field, but rather values assigned in the value list.
Data Field
in the form are not visible, but rather the assigned values.
If you chose &quot; Valuelist &quot; on the
Data
tab under
Type of list contents
and assigned a reference value to the visible list entries in the form under
List entries
(entered in the
General
tab), then the reference values are compared with the data content of the given data field.
If a reference value corresponds to the content of a data field, the associated list entries are displayed in the form.
Bound field
Data field
.
Valid values for this property are 1, 2, 3, and so on.
Bound field
cell in the property browser, the first field of the result set is used to display and to exchange data.
This property for list boxes defines which data field of a linked table is displayed in the form.
Type of list contents
field if the display is determined by an SQL command or the (linked) table is accessed.
With the
Bound field
property, you use an index to specify to which data field of the query or of the table the list field is linked.
Bound field
is only for forms that are used to access more than one table.
If the form is based on only one table, the field to be displayed in the form is specified directly under
Data field
.
However, if you want the list box to display data from a table that is linked to the current table over a common data field, the linked data field is defined by the property
Bound field
.
Type of list contents
, the SQL command determines the index to be specified.
Example:
If you specify an SQL command such as &quot; SELECT Field1, Field2 FROM tablename &quot; under
List content
, refer to the following table:
Bound field
Link
{empty}
Data field
.
1
Data field
.
Type of list contents
, the table structure defines the index to be specified.
Example:
If a database table is selected under
List content
, refer to the following table:
Bound field
Link
{empty}
Data field
.
1
Data field
.
2
Data field
.
Type of list contents
Determines the data to fill the lists in list and combo boxes.
Determines the data to fill the lists in list and combo boxes.
List entries
field of the
General
tab appear in the control.
For database forms, you can use reference values (see the
References Using Value Lists
section).
If the content of the control is read from a database, you can determine the type of the data source with the other options.
For example, you can choose between tables and queries.
List content
With database forms, specifies the data source for the list content of the form-element.
This field can be used to define a value list for documents without a database connection.
List content
, provided that these objects exist in your database.
All available database objects of the type selected under
Type of list contents
are offered here.
If you have selected the &quot; Value List &quot; option as the type, you can use references for database forms.
If the display of the control is controlled by an SQL command, the SQL statement is entered here.
Examples of SQL statements:
For list boxes, an SQL statement may have the following form
SELECT field1, field2 FROM table,
Data field
if
Bound field
= 1 was selected.
For combo boxes, an SQL statement may take the following form
SELECT DISTINCT field FROM table,
Here &quot; field &quot; is a data field from the list table &quot; table &quot; whose content is displayed in the list of the combo box.
Value lists for HTML documents
List content
.
Select the option &quot; Valuelist &quot; under
Type of list contents
.
The values entered here will not be visible in the form, and are used to assign values to the visible entries.
The entries made under
List content
correspond to the HTML tag < OPTION VALUE=... > .
General
tab under
List entries
, and the value list entered on the
Data
tab under
List content
, are taken into consideration:
If a (non-empty) text is at the selected position in the value list ( < OPTION VALUE=... > ), it will be transmitted.
Otherwise, the text displayed in the ( < OPTION > ) control is sent.
List content
at the corresponding position (note uppercase/lowercase). $[officename] interprets this input as an empty string and assigns it to the respective list entry.
List content
using an example list box named &quot; ListBox1 &quot; .
In this case, &quot; Item &quot; designates a list entry visible in the form:
HTML Tag
JavaScript
Entry in value list of the control (List content)
Transmitted data
< OPTION > Item
Not possible
&quot; &quot;
the visible list entry ( &quot; ListBox1=Item &quot; )
< OPTION VALUE= &quot; Value &quot; > Item
ListBox1.options[0].value= &quot; Value &quot;
&quot; Value &quot;
The value assigned to the list entry ( &quot; ListBox1=Value &quot; )
< OPTION VALUE= &quot; &quot; > Item
ListBox1.options[0].value= &quot; &quot;
&quot; $$$empty$$$ &quot;
An empty string ( &quot; ListBox1= &quot; )
Empty string is NULL
Defines how an empty string input should be handled.
If set to Yes, an input string of length zero will be treated as a value NULL.
If set to No, any input will be treated as-is without any conversion.
An empty string is a string of length zero ( &quot; &quot; ).
Normally, a value NULL is not the same as an empty string.
In general, a term NULL is used to denote an undefined value, an unknown value, or &quot; no value has been entered yet. &quot;
Database systems vary and they might handle a value NULL differently.
Refer to documentations of the database that you are using.
Filter proposal
Data
tab of the corresponding
Properties
dialogue box.
In subsequent searches in the filter mode, you can select from all information contained in these fields.
The field content can then be selected using the AutoComplete function.
Note, however, that this function requires a greater amount of memory space and time, especially when used in large databases and should therefore be used sparingly.
