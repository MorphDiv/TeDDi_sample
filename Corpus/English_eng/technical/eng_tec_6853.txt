Troubleshooting sound problems
& kde; uses the & arts; sound system which is complex and powerful, making it difficult for some users to troubleshoot when things go wrong. Here are some tips to help you diagnose what it's doing when your sound misbehaves:
How can I troubleshoot sound related problems in & kde;?
To check that sound is working independently of & arts;, make sure that artsd is n't running and then try playing sound through XMMS or another multimedia application that is n't a part of & kde;. If that application does n't play sound, then your general sound setup is probably broken and it's not a & kde; problem.
Try playing sound with artsplay / path/ to/ some/ soundfile. Try various formats, ogg, mp3 and wav. Any error messages there might be useful in pointing you in the right direction.
Try setting the & arts; output method to OSS. In the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia Sound System. On the Hardware tab, under Select the audio device choose Open Sound System. If you are running alsa this will use the OSS emulation, which may give better or worse results.
Running artsd -l 0 from a terminal will give you a lot of debug output, some of which might help you to diagnose the problem. Trying this in conjunction with using artsplay in a second terminal can give a wealth of information. If an artsd instance is already running, exit it with artsshell terminate
I've upgraded to the latest version of & kde; keeping my old configuration, and my system sounds do n't work anymore!
Assuming you've installed & arts; correctly and you still have the codecs installed your previous & kde; installation needed, chances are this is a small problem with your knotifyrc. To confirm this, try creating an entirely new user and seeing if system notifications work under the new account. If they do, try moving your $KDEHOME / share/ config/ knotifyrc out of the way for your original user to see if this solves the problem.
