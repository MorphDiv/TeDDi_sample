This handbook describes & kdeprint;. & kdeprint; is not a standalone program. It is the new printing framework for & kde; 2.2. & kdeprint; is an intermediate layer between & kde; (or other) applications and the selected (and installed) print subsystem of your OS (OS;).

Introduction
It should be noted that both the developer of this application, and the author of this document are most familiar with & CUPS; as a printing system. At the time of writing, & CUPS; is the best supported printing subsystem, and it is the best documented.
This handbook is a work in progress, and later versions of the & kdeprint; software and editions of this handbook will support and explore more closely other printing systems.
In the meantime, even if your printing subsystem is not yet well covered, you are encouraged to explore the Printing Manager module in & kcontrol;, and you will find its operation to hopefully be fairly self evident, no matter what printing subsystem you use.

To configure your printing subsystem from & kcontrol;
To configure your printing subsystem from & kcontrol;, go to System Printing Manager and select your subsystem. Or you can let & kdeprint; try to determine it...
