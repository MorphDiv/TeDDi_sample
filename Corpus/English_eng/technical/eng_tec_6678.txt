You are running a version of Parley that has not officially been released yet. Please be aware that this version might be unstable, crash or forget to save your changes. Please report any issues that you encounter to improve Parley! http: / /bugs. kde. org
Parley enables you to edit many additional properties of the words you enter. Use "Settings" - > "Tools" to enable different tools that will help you set additional information for your vocabulary. These include images, sound, word types and many more. Choose the ones you like.
To search for a word, simply type it into the search bar.
If you do not want to see the answer again after pressing enter when practicing, you can configure Parley to directly skip to the next entry. You can even choose to display the answer for a fixed amount of time. Use "Configure Practice..." - > "Advanced" - > "Show solution after answering".
If you want to see all words of a certain word type (e. g. nouns), simply select the word type in the list. To show the word type list, use "Settings" - > "Tools" - > "Word Types" in the menu.
You can drag and drop your lessons to change their order or even make a lesson a child of another lesson.
You can simply drag a word into the word types list to change its type. You can even select multiple words at the same time.
Setting Images A fast way to set an image for a word is to simply drop it onto the image dock.
Word Types You can set a special tag to some word types to let Parley know their grammatical meaning. For verbs for example you can then enter conjugations.
Multiple Choice For some vocabularies multiple choice tests work best. You can add choices to a word that will always be displayed in Multiple Choice mode. Otherwise random choices are generated from the other entries in the document. (Use the Multiple Choice tool for that.)
Want to enter pronunciation symbols quickly? Double-click the symbol you need to directly add it.
You can use the "Download New Vocabulary" dialog or visit the website listing many vocabulary documents: http: / /edu. kde. org/ contrib/ kvtml2. php.
