EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
CORLENTOR
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Corlentor?
Corlentor is a salmon-coloured tablet (oblong 5 mg, triangular 7.5 mg) for oral use.
Corlentor contains the active ingredient ivabradine at strengths of 5 mg or 7.5 mg.
What is Corlentor used for?
Corlentor is used to treat the symptoms of chronic stable angina pectoris (pains to the chest, jaw, back, brought on by physical effort, and due to problems with the blood flow to the heart).
Corlentor is used in patients with a normal sinus rhythm (heartbeat), who cannot take, or cannot tolerate, beta-blockers (another type of medicine to treat angina).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Corlentor used?
Corlentor is taken orally, twice daily, i. e. once in the morning and once in the evening during meals.
The usual recommended starting dose of Corlentor is 5 mg twice daily.
A 2.5 mg starting dose can be used in patients over the age of 75, before reaching the 5 mg dose.
After three to four weeks of treatment, the dose may be increased to 7.5 mg twice daily depending on the patient’ s response.
How does Corlentor work?
Angina symptoms (chest, arm or jaw pain) are caused by the heart not receiving enough oxygenated blood.
In chronic stable angina, these symptoms appear during physical effort.
Corlentor is a pure heart rate lowering agent.
Ivabradine, the active substance in Corlentor, works by inhibiting the lf channels: these are specialised cells in the sinus node, the‘ pacemaker ’ for the heart that controls the heart contractions and regulates heart rate.
When the channels are blocked, the heart rate is lowered, the heart has less work to do and needs less oxygenated blood.
Corlentor therefore reduces or prevents the symptoms of angina.
How has Corlentor been studied?
Corlentor has been studied in four clinical trials; lasting 3 or 4 months and including a total of 3,222 patients, of whom 2,168 received Corlentor.
The medicine was compared with placebo (dummy treatment), atenolol or amlodipine (other medicines used to treat angina).
It was also studied as an ‘ add on ’ treatment in patients who also received amlodipine.
The main measures of effectiveness were exercise tests, e. g. how much exercise a patient could do before angina.

Corlentor was significantly better than placebo at improving exercise capacity and was as effective as atenolol and amlodipine.
However, adding Corlentor to amlodipine did not provide extra benefit.
What is the risk associated with Corlentor?
The most common side effect (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) is luminous phenomena (‘ phosphenes’, a temporary brightness in the field of vision).
Other common side effects are blurred vision, bradycardia (very slow heart rate), irregular heartbeat, headache (generally during the first month of treatment) and dizziness.
For the full description of all side effects reported with Corlentor, please see the Package Leaflet.
Corlentor should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ivabradine or any of the other ingredients, who have a resting heart rate below 60 beats/ minute, who have very low blood pressure, who have various types of heart disorders (cardiogenic shock, rhythm disorders, heart attack or heart failure), who have severe liver problems, or who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
Why has Corlentor been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Corlentor has sufficient effectiveness against angina, and an acceptable safety profile, for Corlentor to provide an alternative treatment for patients with chronic stable angina pectoris with normal sinus rhythm who cannot take beta-blockers.
They decided that Corlentor’ s benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that Corlentor be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Corlentor:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Corlentor to Les Laboratoires Servier on 25 October 2005.
