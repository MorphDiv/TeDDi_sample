Tali is like Yahtzee for GNOME or like poker with dice. The player rolls dice to try to make the best possible combinations, like 4 of a kind, small straight, and full house. The player is allowed 3 rolls per turn and can hold certain dice with each roll.

Introduction


To run

Playing GNOME Tali
GNOME Tali in action
GNOME Tali main window screenshot.
When play starts, you see the results of your first throw of the dice.
Click on the dice you wish to roll again.
When you have selected all the dice you wish to reroll, press the
When you have a hand you like or have run out of chances to throw the dice, click on a row corresponding to what you think is your best scoring combination. It is very possible to have a score of zero and if you click on the wrong row, you will be scored accordingly. (Say for example, you get yahtzee -- 5 of a kind -- and click on the large straight row, you will receive a zero in your large straight score).
You can only use each combination once, i.e. once you've entered something in a slot, you can't change the score later if you roll a better hand.
There is one exception to this rule, if you roll a yahtzee a second time you can put it in the yahtzee row again for an extra fifty points. You can keep doing this each time you get another yahtzee. At the end of the game you will be given extra rolls to fill in the other rows. Be warned that if you score zero in your yahtzee row (i.e. you filled that row with something that wasn't a yahtzee) then you can't put a yahtzee in afterward, zero is all you will score.
There is also a bonus of 35 points if you score a total of 63 points or more in the top six rows.
Using the keyboard
As an alternative to using the mouse, the keys 1 through 5 toggle the dice just as if you had clicked them. The key 1 corresponds to the first die and so on. Use the usual controls to roll the dice and select a row. i.e. use tab to switch between the roll button and the score area, use the arrow keys to navigate up and down the rows and use space to select.
Game Options
GNOME Tali preferences
GNOME Tali preferences dialog box.
Human Players
Number of players
Selects the number of human players. As described above you are only allowed six total players.
Computer Opponents
Delay between rolls
Make the computer opponents pause between rolls of the dice so you can see what they are doing. Slows down game play some.
Number of opponents
Select the number of computer opponents. You are allowed a total of six human and computer players. If you attempt to increase this number near the limit, the number of human players will be decreased to maintain only six total players.
Game Type
Version of the game to play
Play either the regular version (similar to Yahtzee) or the version with colors (similar to Kismet). When you change game type, you must restart the game to see use the new game type.
Player Names
To change the names of the players just enter new names in the boxes.
Game Strategy
The 63 points needed for the bonus in the upper half corresponds to getting three of each die type in each row. If you score more than three dice in the fives and sixes rows then you can afford to place a bad roll in either the ones row or the twos row and still get the bonus. In the Colors version, you get a bonus of 55 if your upper half total is between 71 and 77, and a bonus of 75 if your upper half total is greater than 77.
Don't forget about multiple yahtzees, if you roll a second yahtzee you can also put it in the yahtzee row for even more points. This only applies to the regular game.
Known Bugs and Limitations
When you switch game type, the game does not use the new dice images until you restart gtali. It should play correctly with the "wrong" dice.
