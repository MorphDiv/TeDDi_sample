(PHP 4)
This function will send the contents of the output buffer (if any) and turn output buffering off.
If you want to further process the buffer' s contents you have to call ob_get_contents() before ob_end_flush() as the buffer contents are discarded after ob_end_flush() is called.
See also ob_start(), ob_get_contents(), ob_flush() and ob_end_clean().
