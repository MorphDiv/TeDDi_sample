Export of text files
/text/shared/00/00000207.xhp
Export of text files
Export of text files
dialogue box allows you to define the export options for text files.
The dialogue box will be displayed if you save spreadsheet data as file type &quot; Text CSV &quot; , and if the
Edit filter settings
check box is marked in the
Save As
dialogue box.
Field options
Defines the field separator, text separator and character set that is used for the text export.
Character set
Specifies the character set for text export.
Field delimiter
Choose or enter the field delimiter, which separates data fields.
Text delimiter
Choose or enter the text delimiter, which encloses every data field.
Save cell content as shown
Enabled by default, data will be saved as displayed, including applied number formats.
If this check box is not marked, raw data content will be saved, as in older versions of %PRODUCTNAME.
i76507, see http://specs.openoffice.org/calc/filters/csv/save-to-csv.odt
Depending on the number format, saving cell content as shown may write values that during an import cannot be interpreted as numerical values anymore.
Fixed column width
Exports all data fields with a fixed width.
The width of a data field in the exported text file is set to the current width of the corresponding column.
Values are exported in the format as currently seen in the cell.
If a value is longer than the fixed column width, it will be exported as a ### string.
If a text string is longer than the fixed column width, it will be truncated at the end.
The alignment Left, Centred and Right will be simulated by inserted blanks.
