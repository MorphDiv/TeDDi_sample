(PHP 3, PHP 4)
pg_connect() returns a connection resource that is needed by other PostgreSQL functions.
pg_connect() opens a connection to a PostgreSQL database specified by the connection_string.
It returns a connection resource on success.
It returns FALSE if the connection could not be made. connection_string should be a quoted string.
Example 1.
Using pg_connect
?php $dbconn = pg_connect ("dbname=mary"); / /connect to a database named "mary "$dbconn2 = pg_connect ("host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mary"); / / connect to a database named "mary" on "localhost "at port "5432" $dbconn3 = pg_connect ("host=sheep port=5432 dbname=mary user=lamb password=foo"); / /connect to a database named "mary "on the host "sheep" with a username and password $conn_string = "host=sheep port=5432 dbname=test user=lamb password=bar"; $dbconn4 = pg_connect ($conn_string); / /connect to a database named "test "on the host "sheep" with a username and password?
If a second call is made to pg_connect() with the same connection_string, no new connection will be established, but instead, the connection resource of the already opened connection will be returned.
You can have multiple connections to the same database if you use different connection string.
The old syntax with multiple parameters $conn = pg_connect ("host", "port", "options", "tty", "dbname") has been deprecated.
See also pg_pconnect(), pg_close(), pg_host(), pg_port(), pg_tty(), pg_options() and pg_dbname().
