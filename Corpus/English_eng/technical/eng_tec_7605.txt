CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Cattle (calves and young cattle) and pigs
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
Cattle:
For use in acute respiratory infection with appropriate antibiotic therapy to reduce clinical signs in cattle.
For use in diarrhoea in combination with oral re-hydration therapy to reduce clinical signs in calves of over one week of age and young, non-lactating cattle.
Pigs:
For use in non-infectious locomotor disorders to reduce the symptoms of lameness and inflammation.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in animals suffering from impaired hepatic, cardiac or renal function and haemorrhagic disorders, or where there is evidence of ulcerogenic gastrointestinal lesions.
Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
For the treatment of diarrhoea in cattle, do not use in animals of less than one week of age.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
None.
2 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals If adverse reactions occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in very severely dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animals which require parenteral rehydration, as there may be a potential risk of renal toxicity.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals Accidental self-injection may give rise to pain.
People with known hypersensitivity to NSAID should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Subcutaneous and intramuscular administration is well tolerated; only a slight transient swelling at the injection site following subcutaneous administration was observed in less than 10% of the cattle treated in clinical studies.
In very rare cases anaphylactoid reactions may occur and should be treated symptomatically.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Cattle:
Can be used during pregnancy.
Pigs:
Can be used during pregnancy and lactation.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Do not administer concurrently with glucocorticosteroids, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or with anti-coagulant agents.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Cattle:
Single subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 0.5 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight (i. e.
10.0 ml/ 100 kg body weight) in combination with antibiotic therapy or with oral re-hydration therapy, as appropriate.
Pigs:
Single intramuscular injection at a dosage of 0.4 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight (i. e.
2.0 ml/ 25 kg body weight).
If required, a second administration of meloxicam can be given after 24 hours.
Avoid introduction of contamination during use.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
In the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated.
3 4.11 Withdrawal periods
Cattle:
Meat and offal:
15 days
Pigs:
Meat and offal:
5 days

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids (oxicams) ATCvet code:
QM01AC06
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-exudative, analgesic and antipyretic properties.
Meloxicam also has anti-endotoxic properties because it has been shown to inhibit production of thromboxane B2 induced by E. coli endotoxin administration in calves and pigs.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Absorption After a single subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg meloxicam/ kg, Cmax values of 2.1 µg/ ml were reached after 7.7 hours in young cattle.
Following single intramuscular doses of 0.4 mg meloxicam/ kg, a Cmax value of 1.1 to 1.5 µg/ ml was reached within 1 hour in pigs.
Distribution More than 98% of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins.
The highest meloxicam concentrations are to be found in liver and kidney.
Comparatively low concentrations are detectable in skeletal muscle and fat.
Metabolism Meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma.
In cattle, meloxicam is also a major excretion product in milk and bile whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound.
In pigs, bile and urine contain only traces of the parent compound.
Meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol, an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 26 hours after subcutaneous injection in young cattle.
In pigs, after intramuscular administration, the mean plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours.
Approximately 50% of the administered dose is eliminated via urine and the remainder via faeces.

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-exudative, analgesic and antipyretic effects.
It reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue.
To a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation.

After two intramuscular doses of 0.4 mg meloxicam/ kg, a Cmax value of 1.9 µg/ ml was reached after 1 hour in pigs.
Distribution More than 98% of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins.
The highest meloxicam concentrations are to be found in liver and kidney.
Comparatively low concentrations are detectable in skeletal muscle and fat.
Metabolism Meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma.
In cattle, meloxicam is also a major excretion product in milk and bile whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound.
In pigs, bile and urine contain only traces of the parent compound.
Meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol, an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 26 hours and 17.5 hours after subcutaneous injection in young cattle and lactating cows, respectively.
9 In pigs, after intramuscular administration the mean plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours.
Approximately 50% of the administered dose is eliminated via urine and the remainder via faeces.

The Committee considered that at the concentration of the dose in the product to be administered to the target species, the excipient glycofurol was not pharmacologically active.
It therefore concluded, in accordance with its recent position paper on pharmacologically active excipients, that an MRL was not required to be established for this substance.
