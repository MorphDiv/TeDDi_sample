Overview
Example of applying the Spread filter
Original image
Filter
The Spread filter swaps each pixel in the active layer or selection with another randomly chosen pixel by a user specified amount. It works on color transitions, not on plain color areas. No new color is introduced.

Slur
Example of applying the Slur filter
Filter
Slurring produces an effect resembling melting the image downwards; if a pixel is to be slurred, there is an 80% chance that it is replaced by the value of a pixel directly above it; otherwise, one of the two pixels to the left or right of the one above is used. All or only some pixels in an active layer or selection are affected, the percentage of affected pixels is determined by the

Randomization (%)
This slider represents the percentage of pixels of the active layer or selection which will be slurred. The higher value, the more pixels are slurred, but because of the way the filter works, its effect is most noticeable if this slider is set to a medium value, somewhere around 50. Experiment with it and try for yourself!
Repeat
This slider represents the number of times the filter will be applied. Higher values result in more slurring, moving the color over a longer distance.

RGB Noise
Example of applying the
Filter
The RGB Noise filter adds a normally distributed noise to a layer or a selection. It uses the RGB color model to produce the noise (noise is added to red, green and blue values of each pixel). A normal distribution means, that only slight noise is added to the most pixels in the affected area, while less pixels are affected by more extreme values. (If you apply this filter to an image filled with a solid grey color and then look at its histogram, you will see a classic bell-shaped Gaussian curve.)
The result is very naturally looking noise.
This filter does not work with indexed images.

Correlated noise
Noise may be additive (uncorrelated) or multiplicative (correlated - also known as speckle noise). When checked, every channel value is multiplied by an normally distributed value. So the noise depends on the channel values: a greater channel value leads to more noise, while dark colors (small values) tend to remain dark.
Independent RGB
When this radio button is checked, you can move each RGB slider separately. Otherwise, sliders R, G and B will be moved all together. The same relative noise will then be added to all channels in each pixel, so the hue of pixels does not change much.

These slidebars and adjacent input boxes allow to set noise level (0.00nbsp;-nbsp;1.00) in each channel. Alpha channel is only present if your layer holds such a channel. In case of a grayscale image, a
The value set by these sliders actually determine the standard deviation of the normal distribution of applied noise. The used standard deviation is a half of the set value (where 1 is the distance between the lowest and highest possible value in a channel).

HSV Noise
Example of applying the
Filter
The HSV Noise filter creates noise in the active layer or selection by using the Hue, Saturation, Value (luminosity) color model.

Holdness
This slider (1 -8) controls how much the new pixel color value is allowed to be applied compared to the existing color. A low holdness will give an important hue variation. A high holdness will give a weak variation.
Hue
This slider changes the color of the pixels in a random pattern. It selects an increasing available color range in the HSV color circle starting from the original pixel color.
Saturation
This slider increases saturation of scattered pixels.
Value
This slider increases brightness of scattered pixels.
