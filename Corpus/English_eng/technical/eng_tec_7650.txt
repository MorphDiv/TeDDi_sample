IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
ATCvet code:
QI05AD02
The vaccine stimulates active immunity against equine influenza.
The vaccine strains vCP2242 and vCP1533 are recombinant canarypox viruses expressing the haemagglutinin HA gene from the equine influenza virus strains A/ equi-2/ Ohio/ 03 (American strain) and A/ equi-2/ Newmarket/ 2/ 93 (European strain), respectively.
After inoculation, the viruses do not multiply in the horse but express the protective proteins.
As a consequence, these components induce immunity against equine influenza virus (H3N8).
