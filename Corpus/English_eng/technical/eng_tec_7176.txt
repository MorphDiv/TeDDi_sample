Compression mode
A codec designed to be the successor of the MP3 format, providing greater sound quality and transparency than MP3 files coded at the same bit rate.
AAC takes a modular approach to encoding. There are four default profiles using different tools: (LC) -> the simplest and most widely used and supported; (MAIN) -> like the LC profile, with the addition of backwards prediction; (SRS) -> a.k.a. Scalable Sample Rate (MPEG-4 AAC-SSR); (LTP) -> an improvement of the MAIN profile using a forward predictor with lower computational complexity.
Conventional transform coding schemes often encounter problems with signals that vary heavily over time, especially speech signals. Temporal noise shaping can be viewed as a postprocessing step which goal is to overcome this limitation.
ADTS headers
Raw AAC
CD Quality, AAC
Used for converting to CD-quality audio, but with the lossy AAC codec. Use this for preparing files for copying to devices that only support the AAC codec. Note that using this format may be illegal in your jurisdiction; contact your lawyer for advice.
CD Quality, Lossless
Used for converting to CD-quality audio, but with a lossless compression codec. Use this if you later want to edit the file or burn it to CD.
CD Quality, Lossy
Used for converting to CD-quality audio, but with a lossy compression codec. Use this for CD extraction and radio recordings.
CD Quality, MP3
Used for converting to CD-quality audio, but with the lossy MP3 codec. Use this for preparing files for copying to devices that only support the MP3 codec. Note that using this format may be illegal in your jurisdiction; contact your lawyer for advice.
Voice, Lossless
Used for converting to lossless voice-quality audio. Use this for recording and editing speech.
Voice, Lossy
Used for converting to lossy voice-quality audio. Use this for recording speech that doesn't need to be edited.
An Open Source codec that compresses but does not degrade audio quality (lossless).
A proprietary and older, but also popular, lossy audio format that produces larger files at lower bitrates.

A codec optimized for high quality speech at low bit rate.
Specify the complexity allowed for the encoder. The cpu requirement for a complexity of 10 is about five times higher than for 1.
Voice activity detection detects non-speech periods and encodes them with just enough bits to reproduce the background noise. Implicitly activated in vbr mode.
Allows to stop transmitting completely when the background noise is stationary. Non transmission periods are encoded with 5 bits per sample that is equivalent to a bitrate of about 250 bits/s.
An Open Source, lossy audio codec with high quality output at a lower file size than MP3.
High quality with large file size (no compression).
A fast and efficient Open Source audio format offering lossless and high quality lossy encoding with great dynamic range.
Fast compression
Normal compression
High compression
Very high compression
Use better but slower filters for better compression/quality. Worst: 0; Best: 6.
Store MD5 hash of raw samples within the file. It can be used by wavpack during decompression to verify the data integrity of lossless files.
