Fill Order
Document Name
Image Description
A character string giving the title of the image. It may be a comment such as "1988 company picnic" or the like. Two-bytes character codes cannot be used. When a 2-bytes code is necessary, the Exif Private tag <UserComment> is to be used.
Manufacturer
The manufacturer of the recording equipment. This is the manufacturer of the DSC, scanner, video digitizer or other equipment that generated the image. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.
Model
The model name or model number of the equipment. This is the model name or number of the DSC, scanner, video digitizer or other equipment that generated the image. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.
Strip Offsets
For each strip, the byte offset of that strip. It is recommended that this be selected so the number of strip bytes does not exceed 64 Kbytes. With JPEG compressed data this designation is not needed and is omitted. See also <RowsPerStrip> and <StripByteCounts>.
Orientation
The image orientation viewed in terms of rows and columns.
Samples per Pixel
The number of components per pixel. Since this standard applies to RGB and YCbCr images, the value set for this tag is 3. In JPEG compressed data a JPEG marker is used instead of this tag.
Rows per Strip
The number of rows per strip. This is the number of rows in the image of one strip when an image is divided into strips. With JPEG compressed data this designation is not needed and is omitted. See also <StripOffsets> and <StripByteCounts>.
Strip Byte Count
The total number of bytes in each strip. With JPEG compressed data this designation is not needed and is omitted.
X-Resolution
The number of pixels per <ResolutionUnit> in the <ImageWidth> direction. When the image resolution is unknown, 72 [dpi] is designated.
Y-Resolution
The number of pixels per <ResolutionUnit> in the <ImageLength> direction. The same value as <XResolution> is designated.
Planar Configuration
Indicates whether pixel components are recorded in a chunky or planar format. In JPEG compressed files a JPEG marker is used instead of this tag. If this field does not exist, the TIFF default of 1 (chunky) is assumed.
Resolution Unit
The unit for measuring <XResolution> and <YResolution>. The same unit is used for both <XResolution> and <YResolution>. If the image resolution is unknown, 2 (inches) is designated.
Transfer Function
A transfer function for the image, described in tabular style. Normally this tag is not necessary, since color space is specified in the color space information tag (<ColorSpace>).
Software
This tag records the name and version of the software or firmware of the camera or image input device used to generate the image. The detailed format is not specified, but it is recommended that the example shown below be followed. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.
Date and Time
The date and time of image creation. In this standard (EXIF-2.1) it is the date and time the file was changed.
Artist
This tag records the name of the camera owner, photographer or image creator. The detailed format is not specified, but it is recommended that the information be written as in the example below for ease of Interoperability. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.
White Point
The chromaticity of the white point of the image. Normally this tag is not necessary, since color space is specified in the color space information tag (<ColorSpace>).
Primary Chromaticities
The chromaticity of the three primary colors of the image. Normally this tag is not necessary, since color space is specified in the color space information tag (<ColorSpace>).
Defined by Adobe Corporation to enable TIFF Trees within a TIFF file.
Transfer Range
JPEG Interchange Format
The offset to the start byte (SOI) of JPEG compressed thumbnail data. This is not used for primary image JPEG data.
JPEG Interchange Format Length
The number of bytes of JPEG compressed thumbnail data. This is not used for primary image JPEG data. JPEG thumbnails are not divided but are recorded as a continuous JPEG bitstream from SOI to EOI. Appn and COM markers should not be recorded. Compressed thumbnails must be recorded in no more than 64 Kbytes, including all other data to be recorded in APP1.
YCbCr Coefficients
The matrix coefficients for transformation from RGB to YCbCr image data. No default is given in TIFF; but here the value given in "Color Space Guidelines", is used as the default. The color space is declared in a color space information tag, with the default being the value that gives the optimal image characteristics Interoperability this condition.
YCbCr Sub-Sampling
The sampling ratio of chrominance components in relation to the luminance component. In JPEG compressed data a JPEG marker is used instead of this tag.
YCbCr Positioning
The position of chrominance components in relation to the luminance component. This field is designated only for JPEG compressed data or uncompressed YCbCr data. The TIFF default is 1 (centered); but when Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:2 it is recommended in this standard that 2 (co-sited) be used to record data, in order to improve the image quality when viewed on TV systems. When this field does not exist, the reader shall assume the TIFF default. In the case of Y:Cb:Cr = 4:2:0, the TIFF default (centered) is recommended. If the reader does not have the capability of supporting both kinds of <YCbCrPositioning>, it shall follow the TIFF default regardless of the value in this field. It is preferable that readers be able to support both centered and co-sited positioning.
Reference Black/White
The reference black point value and reference white point value. No defaults are given in TIFF, but the values below are given as defaults here. The color space is declared in a color space information tag, with the default being the value that gives the optimal image characteristics Interoperability these conditions.
XML Packet
XMP Metadata
CFA Pattern
Indicates the color filter array (CFA) geometric pattern of the image sensor when a one-chip color area sensor is used. It does not apply to all sensing methods.
Battery Level
Copyright
Copyright information. In this standard the tag is used to indicate both the photographer and editor copyrights. It is the copyright notice of the person or organization claiming rights to the image. The Interoperability copyright statement including date and rights should be written in this field; e.g., "Copyright, John Smith, 19xx. All rights reserved.". In this standard the field records both the photographer and editor copyrights, with each recorded in a separate part of the statement. When there is a clear distinction between the photographer and editor copyrights, these are to be written in the order of photographer followed by editor copyright, separated by NULL (in this case, since the statement also ends with a NULL, there are two NULL codes) (see example 1). When only the photographer is given, it is terminated by one NULL code (see example 2). When only the editor copyright is given, the photographer copyright part consists of one space followed by a terminating NULL code, then the editor copyright is given (see example 3). When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown.
Exposure time, given in seconds (sec).
F-Number
The F number.
Image Resources Block
A pointer to the Exif IFD. Interoperability, Exif IFD has the same structure as that of the IFD specified in TIFF. ordinarily, however, it does not contain image data as in the case of TIFF.
Exposure Program
The class of the program used by the camera to set exposure when the picture is taken.
Spectral Sensitivity
Indicates the spectral sensitivity of each channel of the camera used. The tag value is an ASCII string compatible with the standard developed by the ASTM Technical Committee.

Exif Version
The version of this standard supported. Nonexistence of this field is taken to mean nonconformance to the standard.
Date and Time (Original)
The date and time when the original image data was generated. For a digital still camera the date and time the picture was taken are recorded.
Date and Time (Digitized)
The date and time when the image was stored as digital data.
Components Configuration
Information specific to compressed data. The channels of each component are arranged in order from the 1st component to the 4th. For uncompressed data the data arrangement is given in the <PhotometricInterpretation> tag. However, since <PhotometricInterpretation> can only express the order of Y, Cb and Cr, this tag is provided for cases when compressed data uses components other than Y, Cb, and Cr and to enable support of other sequences.
Compressed Bits per Pixel
Information specific to compressed data. The compression mode used for a compressed image is indicated in unit bits per pixel.
Shutter Speed
Shutter speed. The unit is the APEX (Additive System of Photographic Exposure) setting.
The lens aperture. The unit is the APEX value.
Brightness
The value of brightness. The unit is the APEX value. Ordinarily it is given in the range of -99.99 to 99.99.
Exposure Bias
The exposure bias. The units is the APEX value. Ordinarily it is given in the range of -99.99 to 99.99.
Maximum Aperture Value
The smallest F number of the lens. The unit is the APEX value. Ordinarily it is given in the range of 00.00 to 99.99, but it is not limited to this range.
Subject Distance
The distance to the subject, given in meters.
The metering mode.
Light Source
The kind of light source.
This tag is recorded when an image is taken using a strobe light (flash).
The actual focal length of the lens, in mm. Conversion is not made to the focal length of a 35 mm film camera.
Subject Area
This tag indicates the location and area of the main subject in the overall scene.
TIFF/EP Standard ID
Maker Note
A tag for manufacturers of Exif writers to record any desired information. The contents are up to the manufacturer.
User Comment
A tag for Exif users to write keywords or comments on the image besides those in <ImageDescription>, and without the character code limitations of the <ImageDescription> tag. The character code used in the <UserComment> tag is identified based on an ID code in a fixed 8-byte area at the start of the tag data area. The unused portion of the area is padded with NULL ("00.h"). ID codes are assigned by means of registration. The designation method and references for each character code are defined in the specification. The value of CountN is determined based on the 8 bytes in the character code area and the number of bytes in the user comment part. Since the TYPE is not ASCII, NULL termination is not necessary. The ID code for the <UserComment> area may be a Defined code such as JIS or ASCII, or may be Undefined. The Undefined name is UndefinedText, and the ID code is filled with 8 bytes of all "NULL" ("00.H"). An Exif reader that reads the <UserComment> tag must have a function for determining the ID code. This function is not required in Exif readers that do not use the <UserComment> tag. When a <UserComment> area is set aside, it is recommended that the ID code be ASCII and that the following user comment part be filled with blank characters [20.H].
Sub-second Time
A tag used to record fractions of seconds for the <DateTime> tag.
Sub-second Time (Original)
A tag used to record fractions of seconds for the <DateTimeOriginal> tag.
Sub-second Time (Digitized)
A tag used to record fractions of seconds for the <DateTimeDigitized> tag.
XP Title
A character string giving the title of the image, encoded in UTF-16LE.
XP Comment
A character string containing a comment about the image, encoded in UTF-16LE.
XP Author
A character string containing the name of the image creator, encoded in UTF-16LE.
XP Keywords
A character string containing key words describing the image, encoded in UTF-16LE.
XP Subject
A character string giving the image subject, encoded in UTF-16LE.
The FlashPix format version supported by a FPXR file.
Color Space
The color space information tag is always recorded as the color space specifier. Normally sRGB (=1) is used to define the color space based on the PC monitor conditions and environment. If a color space other than sRGB is used, Uncalibrated (=FFFF.H) is set. Image data recorded as Uncalibrated can be treated as sRGB when it is converted to FlashPix.
Pixel X Dimension
Information specific to compressed data. When a compressed file is recorded, the valid width of the meaningful image must be recorded in this tag, whether or not there is padding data or a restart marker. This tag should not exist in an uncompressed file.
Pixel Y Dimension
Information specific to compressed data. When a compressed file is recorded, the valid height of the meaningful image must be recorded in this tag, whether or not there is padding data or a restart marker. This tag should not exist in an uncompressed file. Since data padding is unnecessary in the vertical direction, the number of lines recorded in this valid image height tag will in fact be the same as that recorded in the SOF.
Related Sound File
This tag is used to record the name of an audio file related to the image data. The only relational information recorded here is the Exif audio file name and extension (an ASCII string consisting of 8 characters + '.' + 3 characters). The path is not recorded. Stipulations on audio and file naming conventions are defined in the specification. When using this tag, audio files must be recorded in conformance to the Exif audio format. Writers are also allowed to store the data such as Audio within APP2 as FlashPix extension stream data. The mapping of Exif image files and audio files is done in any of three ways, [1], [2] and [3]. If multiple files are mapped to one file as in [2] or [3], the above format is used to record just one audio file name. If there are multiple audio files, the first recorded file is given. In the case of [3], for example, for the Exif image file "DSC00001.JPG" only "SND00001.WAV" is given as the related Exif audio file. When there are three Exif audio files "SND00001.WAV", "SND00002.WAV" and "SND00003.WAV", the Exif image file name for each of them, "DSC00001.JPG", is indicated. By combining multiple relational information, a variety of playback possibilities can be supported. The method of using relational information is left to the implementation on the playback side. Since this information is an ASCII character string, it is terminated by NULL. When this tag is used to map audio files, the relation of the audio file to image data must also be indicated on the audio file end.
Interoperability IFD Pointer
Interoperability IFD is composed of tags which stores the information to ensure the Interoperability and pointed by the following tag located in Exif IFD. The Interoperability structure of Interoperability IFD is the same as TIFF defined IFD structure but does not contain the image data characteristically compared with normal TIFF IFD.
Flash Energy
Indicates the strobe energy at the time the image is captured, as measured in Beam Candle Power Seconds (BCPS).
Spatial Frequency Response
This tag records the camera or input device spatial frequency table and SFR values in the direction of image width, image height, and diagonal direction, as specified in ISO 12233.
