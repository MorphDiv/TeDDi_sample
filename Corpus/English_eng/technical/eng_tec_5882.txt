& XML; Completion

This plugin supports writing & XML; files by listing allowed tags and more.
KDE
kate
xml
Introduction
This plugin gives hints about what is allowed at a certain position in an & XML; file, according to the file's DTD. It will list possible elements, attributes, attribute values or entities, depending on the cursor position (eg; all entities are listed if the character on the left of the cursor is amp;). It's also possible to close the nearest open tag on the left.
The DTD must exist in & XML; format, as produced by the Perl program dtdparse. We will call a DTD in this format meta DTD. Some meta DTDs are supplied. They are installed in $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ katexmltools/, which is also the default folder when you choose Assign Meta DTD.... To produce your own meta DTDs, get dtdparse from http: / /dtdparse. sourceforge. net.
How to Use
Start & kate; and open the configuration dialog under Settings Configure & kate;.... Then select Kate XML Completion which will appear in the Application / Plugins section and close the dialog. After that, select XML Assign Meta DTD.... If your document contains no DOCTYPE or the doctype is unknown, you'll have to select a meta DTD from the file system. Otherwise the meta DTD that matches the current document's DOCTYPE will be loaded automatically.
You can now use the plugin while typing your text:
& lt; (less than key)
This will trigger a list of possible elements unless the cursor is inside a tag already. Note that you currently cannot use this to insert the top level element (eg; lt; htmlgt;).
"(quote key)
The quote key will trigger a list of possible attribute values (if there are some) if you are inside a tag.
(space key)
This key will trigger a list of possible attributes for the current element if you are inside a tag.
& (ampersand key)
This key will trigger a list of named entities.
Features and Limitations
You can test all functions and limitations by loading $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ katexmltools/ testcases. xml into & kate; and following the instructions. Note that working with more than one view per document is not yet correctly supported by this plugin.
Menu Structure
Ctrl; Return XML...
This will open a dialog that lets you insert an & XML; element. The & lt;, & gt; characters and the closing tag will be inserted automatically. If you have selected text when this menu item is selected, the selected text will be surrounded by the opening and the closing tag. The dialog also offers completion of all elements that may be inserted at the current cursor position if you have assigned a meta DTD by using Assign Meta DTD....
Ctrl; lt; XML Close Element
This will search your text for a tag that is not yet closed and will close it by inserting the corresponding closing tag. The search starts at the cursor position and goes left. If it cannot find an open tag nothing will happen.
XML Assign Meta DTD...
This will tell the plugin which meta DTD to use for the current document. Note that this assignment will not be saved. You will have to repeat it when you start & kate; the next time.
