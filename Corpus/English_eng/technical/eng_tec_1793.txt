Dim siW1 As Single
Dim siW2 As Single
siW1 = Int(InputBox$ ( &quot; Please enter the first amount &quot; , &quot; Value input &quot; ))
siW2 = Int(InputBox$ ( &quot; Please enter the second amount &quot; , &quot; Value input &quot; ))
Print &quot; The difference is &quot; ; Abs(siW1 - siW2)
End Sub
