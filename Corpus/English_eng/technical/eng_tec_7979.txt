ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Luveris 75 IU, powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
One vial contains 75 IU of lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone {LH}).
Lutropin alfa is produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.
Excipients:
47.75 mg sucrose, 0.1 mg L-methionine, 0.05 mg polysorbate 20
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for solution for injection.
Appearance of the powder: white lyophilised pellet Appearance of the solvent: clear colourless solution
The pH of the reconstituted solution is 7.5 - 8.5.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Luveris in association with a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.
In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Luveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
Self-administration of Luveris should only be performed by patients who are well-motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of Luveris therapy in association with FSH is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
Luveris should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with FSH.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
All clinical experience to date with Luveris in this indication has been gained with concomitant administration of follitropin alfa.
Luveris is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The powder should be reconstituted, immediately prior to use, with the solvent provided.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring (i) follicle size by ultrasound and (ii) oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa (ie. one vial of Luveris) daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5 IU-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
2 When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last Luveris and FSH injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
4.3 Contraindications
Luveris is contraindicated in patients with:
• hypersensitivity to gonadotrophins or to any of the excipients. • ovarian, uterine, or mammary carcinoma; • active, untreated tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland; • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease; • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
This medicinal product should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as ovarian failure, malformation of the sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy or fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.
In addition, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth are at an increased risk of developing hyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular development.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) can become a serious medical event characterised by large ovarian cysts which are prone to rupture.
Excessive ovarian response seldom gives rise to significant hyperstimulation unless hCG is administered to induce ovulation.
It is therefore prudent to withhold hCG in such cases and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
Careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound is recommended prior to and during stimulation therapy, especially in patients with polycystic ovaries.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS is increased by a serum oestradiol level > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and by the presence of more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
Adherence to recommended Luveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy.
In clinical trials, the medicinal product has been shown to increase the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin
3 alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
In clinical trials, there have been no reports of hypersensitivity to lutropin alfa.
No direct comparison of Luveris/ FSH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with Luveris/ FSH is similar to what can be obtained with hMG.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Luveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except follitropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Luveris should not be administered during pregnancy or lactation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Luveris has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
a) General description
Lutropin alfa is used for the stimulation of follicular development in association with follitropin alfa.
In this context, it is difficult to attribute undesirable effects to any one of the substances used.
There is considerable post-marketing safety experience with human luteinising hormone (hLH)- containing medicinal products of urinary origin.
The safety profile of Luveris is expected to be very similar to that of urine derived hLH, with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions and application site disorders.
In a clinical trial, mild and moderate injection site reactions (bruising, pain, redness, itching or swelling) were reported in 7.4% and 0.9% of the injections, respectively.
No severe injection site reactions were reported.
To date no systemic allergic reactions have been reported following Luveris administration.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was observed in less than 6% of patients treated with Luveris.
No severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was reported (section 4.4).
In rare instances, thromboembolisms, adnexal torsion (a complication of ovarian enlargement), and haemoperitoneum have been associated with human menopausal gonadotrophin therapy.
Although these adverse events were not observed, there is the possibility that they may also occur with Luveris.
Ectopic pregnancy may also occur, especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
b) Undesirable effects
The following convention was used for the frequency (events/ no. of patients): very rare :< 1/10,000, rare :> 1/ 10,000 ,< 1/1 ,000, uncommon: > 1/ 1,000 ,< 1/100, common: > 1/ 100 ,< 1/10, very common: > 1/ 10
After best evidence assessment, the following undesirable effects may be observed after administration of Luveris.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
4 Common Gastro-intestinal disorders: nausea, abdominal pain, pelvic pain Reproductive system and breast disorders: ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, ovarian cyst, breast pain General disorders and administration site conditions: headache, somnolence, injection site reaction
The reported undesirable effects are in agreement with those reported for other hLH-containing medicinal products, except for injection site reactions where the incidence was significantly lower with Luveris treatment.
4.9 Overdose
The effects of an overdose of lutropin alfa are unknown, nevertheless there is a possibility that ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may occur, which is further described in section 4.4.
Single doses of up to 40,000 IU of lutropin alfa have been administered to healthy female volunteers without serious adverse events and were well tolerated.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: gonadotrophins.
ATC code:
G03G
Lutropin alfa is a recombinant human luteinising hormone, a glycoprotein composed of non- covalently bound α - and β -subunits.
Luteinising hormone binds on the ovarian theca (and granulosa) cells and testicular Leydig cells, to a receptor shared with human chorionic gonadotrophin hormone (hCG).
This LH/ CG transmembrane receptor is a member of the super-family of G protein-coupled receptors; specifically, it has a large extra-cellular domain.
In vitro the affinity binding of recombinant hLH to the LH/ CG receptor on Leydig tumour cells (MA-10) is between that for hCG and that of pituitary hLH, but within the same order of magnitude.
In the ovaries, during the follicular phase, LH stimulates theca cells to secrete androgens, which will be used as the substrate by granulosa cell aromatase enzyme to produce oestradiol, supporting FSH-induced follicular development.
At mid-cycle, high levels of LH trigger corpus luteum formation and ovulation.
After ovulation, LH stimulates progesterone production in the corpus luteum by increasing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone.
In the stimulation of follicular development in anovulatory women deficient in LH and FSH, the primary effect resulting from administration of lutropin alfa is an increase in oestradiol secretion by the follicles, the growth of which is stimulated by FSH.
In clinical trials, patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l as measured in a central laboratory.
However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.
In these trials the ovulation rate per cycle was 70-75%.
The combination of r-hLH and r-hFSH has not been directly compared with treatment with hMG.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of lutropin alfa have been studied in pituitary desensitised female volunteers from 75 IU up to 40,000 IU.
The pharmacokinetic profile of lutropin alfa is similar to that of urinary-derived hLH.
Following
5 intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of approximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 10-12 hours.
The steady state volume of distribution is around 10-14 l.
Lutropin alfa shows linear pharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered.
Total clearance is around 2 l/ h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine.
The mean residence time is approximately 5 hours.
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 60%; the terminal half-life is slightly prolonged.
The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and repeated administration of Luveris are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is minimal.
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with follitropin alfa when administered simultaneously.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non clinical data reveal no special harzard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential.
As expected from the heterologous protein nature of the hormone, lutropin alfa raised an antibody response in experimental animals after a period that reduced the measurable serum LH levels but did not fully prevent its biological action.
No signs of toxicity due to the development of antibodies to lutropin alfa were observed.
At doses of 10 IU/ kg/ day and greater, repeated administration of lutropin alfa to pregnant rats and rabbits caused impairment of reproductive function including resorption of foetuses and reduced body weight gain of the dams.
However, drug-related teratogenesis was not observed in either animal model.
Other studies have shown that lutropin alfa is not mutagenic.

Further information
1.
WHAT LUVERIS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Luveris is a medicine containing lutropin alfa, a recombinant luteinising hormone (LH) which is essentially similar to the hormone found naturally in humans, but is made by means of biotechnology.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Luveris is recommended for the treatment of women who have been shown to produce very low levels of some of the hormones involved in the natural reproductive cycle.
The medicine is used together with another hormone called FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), to bring about the development of follicles, which are in the ovary, the structures maturing the eggs (ova).
It is followed by treatment with a single dose of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which leads to the release of an egg from the follicle (ovulation).
2.
BEFORE YOU USE LUVERIS
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
Do not take Luveris
• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to lutropin alfa or any of the other ingredients of Luveris. • If you have been diagnosed as having ovarian, uterine or breast cancer. • If you have had a brain tumour diagnosed. • If you have ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease. • If you have unexplained vaginal bleeding.
Take special care with Luveris
This treatment increases your risk of developing a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see also section headed ‘ Possible side effects’).
However, if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
Luveris treatment seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation
18 (containing hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent not to give hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
Your doctor is well aware of this condition and will inform you if necessary.
This is the reason why he will organise careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood sampling before and during the course of treatment.
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as malformation of sexual organs or benign tumours of the womb.
Compared with natural conception, the incidence of multiple pregnancies (mainly twins) and births is increased in patients undergoing this type of treatment.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
If you have had allergic reactions to similar medicines, please inform your doctor.
Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Luveris should not be mixed with other medicinal products in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa.
Studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together, without either product being adversely affected.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You should not take Luveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
3.
HOW TO USE LUVERIS
Always take Luveris exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor if you are not sure.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration, which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
Luveris is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of FSH.
The usual dose starts with 75 IU (1 vial) of Luveris together with 75 IU or 150 IU of FSH.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of FSH by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7-14-day intervals.
Your physician may decide to extend your treatment up to 5 weeks.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of Luveris and FSH.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section headed ‘ Possible Side Effects’).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe FSH at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Luveris is intended for subcutaneous use which means it is given by injection under the skin.
Each vial is for single use only.
19 If you administer Luveris to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
• Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
• Assemble everything you need.
Find a clean area and lay out everything:
- - - - - - -
one vial of Luveris, one ampoule of solvent, two alcohol swabs, one syringe, one reconstitution needle for dissolving the powder in the solvent, a fine-bore needle for subcutaneous injection, a sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles.
•
Open
the ampoule of solvent:
On the head of the solvent ampoule, you will see a small
coloured dot.
Directly below it is where the neck of the ampoule has been treated to make it
easier to break.
Gently flick the top section of the ampoule so that any fluid in the neck of the ampoule drops into the bottom chamber.
Now press the ampoule firmly over the neck, and break the ampoule away from the coloured dot.
Carefully place the open ampoule upright on the work- surface.
• Draw up the solvent:
Attach the reconstitution needle to the syringe, with the syringe in
one hand, pick up the open ampoule, insert the needle and draw up all of the solvent.
Carefully set the syringe down on the work-surface, taking care not to touch the needle.
• Prepare the injection solution:
Remove the protective cap from the Luveris powder vial, pick
up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the vial of Luveris.
Swirl gently without removing the syringe.
Do not shake.
• After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles.
Turn the vial upside down and
20 gently draw the solution back into the syringe.
You may also mix Luveris and follitropin alfa as an alternative to injecting each product separately.
After dissolving the Luveris powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the container with the follitropin alfa powder.
Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe.
Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear.
Up to 3 containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.
• Change the needle for the fine-bore needle and remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles
in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Gently push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
• Immediately inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the
skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
• Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and empty glass containers in the sharps container provided.
Any unused solution must be discarded.
If you use more Luveris than you should
The effects of an overdose of Luveris are unknown, nevertheless there is a possibility that ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may occur, which is further described in ‘Possible side effects'.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section headed ‘Take special care with Luveris’).
If you forget to take Luveris
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
Please contact your doctor.
21 4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Luveris can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
The most frequent adverse events reported have been headache, abdominal pain, breast pain, nausea, somnolence (sleepiness) and ovarian cysts.
Local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, itching, swelling and bruising) have been observed in some cases.
Treatment with FSH and LH followed by hCG can lead to a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see also section headed ‘Take Special Care with Luveris’).
This is when the ovaries over-react to the treatment, and large ovarian cysts develop.
First symptoms of OHSS are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
If you experience serious abdominal pain together with these symptoms, do not give any more injections, and speak to your doctor as soon as possible.
A careful examination will establish whether your ovaries have responded excessively to the treatment.
If so, your doctor may discontinue the FSH and LH, and abandon the treatment with hCG, to prevent the development of more severe OHSS.
Rarely abnormal blood clots in veins have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with Luveris / FSH / hCG therapy.
Torsion of the ovary and bleeding into the abdomen have not been reported with Luveris, however, there have been rare cases reported following treatment with human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG), a urine-derived medication also containing LH.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

Further information
1.
WHAT LUVERIS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Luveris is a medicine containing lutropin alfa, a recombinant luteinising hormone (LH) which is essentially similar to the hormone found naturally in humans, but is made by means of biotechnology.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Luveris is recommended for the treatment of women who have been shown to produce very low levels of some of the hormones involved in the natural reproductive cycle.
The medicine is used together with another hormone called FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), to bring about the development of follicles which are in the ovary, the structures maturing the eggs (ova).
It is followed by treatment with a single dose of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which leads to the release of an egg from the follicle (ovulation).
2.
BEFORE YOU USE LUVERIS
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
Do not take Luveris
• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to lutropin alfa or any of the other ingredients of Luveris. • If you have been diagnosed as having ovarian, uterine or breast cancer. • If you have had a brain tumour diagnosed. • If you have ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease. • If you have unexplained vaginal bleeding.
Take special care with Luveris
This treatment increases your risk of developing a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see also section headed ‘Possible side effects’).
However, if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
Luveris treatment seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation
26 (containing hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent not to give hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
Your doctor is well aware of this condition and will inform you if necessary.
This is the reason why he will organise careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound and blood sampling before and during the course of treatment.
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as malformation of sexual organs or benign tumours of the womb.
Compared with natural conception, the incidence of multiple pregnancies (mainly twins) and births is increased in patients undergoing this type of treatment.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
If you have had allergic reactions to similar medicines, please inform your doctor.
Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Luveris should not be mixed with other medicinal products in the same injection, except for follitropin alfa.
Studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together, without either product being adversely affected.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You should not take Luveris if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
3.
HOW TO USE LUVERIS
Always take Luveris exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor if you are not sure.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration, which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
Luveris is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of FSH.
The usual dose starts with 75 IU (1 vial) of Luveris together with 75 IU or 150 IU of FSH.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of FSH by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7-14-day intervals.
Your physician may decide to extend your treatment up to 5 weeks.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of Luveris and FSH.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section headed ‘Possible Side Effects’).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe FSH at a lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Luveris is intended for subcutaneous use which means it is given by injection under the skin.
Each vial is for single use only.
27 If you administer Luveris to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
• Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
• Assemble everything you need.
Find a clean area and lay out everything:
- - - - - - -
one vial of Luveris, one vial of solvent, two alcohol swabs, one syringe, one reconstitution needle for dissolving the powder in the solvent, a fine-bore needle for subcutaneous injection, a sharps container for safe disposal of glass and needles.
• Remove the protective cap from the solvent vial.
Attach the reconstitution needle to the syringe and draw up some air into the syringe by pulling the plunger to approximately the 1 ml mark.
Then, insert the needle into the vial, push the plunger to expel the air, turn the vial upside down and gently draw up all the solvent.
Set the syringe down carefully on the work-surface taking care not to touch the needle.
• Prepare the injection solution:
Remove the protective cap from the Luveris powder vial, pick up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the vial of Luveris.
Swirl gently without removing the syringe.
Do not shake.
After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), check that the resulting solution is clear and does not contain any particles.
Turn the vial upside down and gently draw the solution back into the syringe.
You may also mix Luveris and follitropin alfa as an alternative to injecting each product separately.
After dissolving the Luveris powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the container with the follitropin alfa powder.
Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe.
Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear.
Up to 3 containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.
• Change the needle for the fine-bore needle and remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Gently push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
• Immediately inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the
28 skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
• Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and empty glass containers in the sharps container provided.
Any unused solution must be discarded.
If you use more Luveris than you should
The effects of an overdose of Luveris are unknown, nevertheless there is a possibility that ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may occur, which is further described in ‘Possible side effects'.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section headed ‘Take special care with Luveris’).
If you forget to take Luveris
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses.
Please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Luveris can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
The most frequent adverse events reported have been headache, abdominal pain, breast pain, nausea, somnolence (sleepiness) and ovarian cysts.
Local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, itching, swelling and bruising) have been observed in some cases.
Treatment with FSH and LH followed by hCG can lead to a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see also section headed ‘Take Special Care with Luveris’).
This is when the ovaries over-react to the treatment, and large ovarian cysts develop.
First symptoms of OHSS are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
If you experience serious abdominal pain together with these symptoms, do not give any more injections, and speak to your doctor as soon as possible.
A careful examination will establish whether your ovaries have responded excessively to the treatment.
If so, your doctor may discontinue the FSH and LH, and abandon the treatment with hCG, to prevent the development of more severe OHSS.
Rarely abnormal blood clots in veins have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with Luveris / FSH / hCG therapy.
Torsion of the ovary and bleeding into the abdomen have not been reported with Luveris, however, there have been rare cases reported following treatment with human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG), a urine-derived medication also containing LH.
Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
29 If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
