EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
EPIVIR
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Epivir?
Epivir is a medicine containing the active substance lamivudine.
It is available as diamond-shaped tablets (white:
150 mg; grey:
300 mg) and as an oral solution (10 mg/ ml).
What is Epivir used for?
Epivir is an antiviral medicine.
It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Epivir used?
Treatment with Epivir should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the management of HIV infection.
The recommended dose of Epivir for patients over 12 years of age is 300 mg daily.
This can be given either once a day (two 150 mg tablets or one 300 mg tablet) or as one 150 mg tablet twice a day.
In children weighing more than 30 kg, the adult dose of 150 mg twice a day should be used.
In children weighing between 14 and 30 kg, the dose depends on body weight.
Children aged over three months who weigh less than 14 kg should be given the oral solution at a dose of 4 mg per kilogram body weight twice a day, up to a maximum of 300 mg per day.
Epivir tablets should ideally be swallowed without crushing.
Patients who cannot swallow tablets should use the oral solution, or they may crush and add the tablets to a small amount of food or drink, before taking the dose immediately.
The dose of Epivir needs to be adjusted in patients who have severe problems with their kidneys.
The oral solution can be used to achieve the appropriate dose.
Epivir can be taken with or without food.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
How does Epivir work?
The active substance in Epivir, lamivudine, is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).
It blocks the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme produced by HIV that allows it to infect cells and make more viruses.
Epivir, taken in combination with other antiviral medicines, reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.
Epivir does not cure HIV infection or AIDS,

How has Epivir been studied?
Epivir has been studied in five main studies involving almost 3,000 adults.
Four of these studies compared Epivir in combination with zidovudine (another antiviral medicine) to either Epivir or zidovudine alone, or to the combination of Epivir and zalcitabine (another antiviral medicine).
The studies examined the effects of Epivir on the levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) and the number of CD4 T-cells in the blood (CD4 cell count).
CD4 T-cells are white blood cells that are important in helping to fight infections, but which are killed by HIV.
The fifth study compared the effects of adding Epivir or placebo (a dummy treatment) to existing treatment for HIV infection in 1,895 adults who had been taking antiviral medicines for at least four weeks.
This study looked at how many patients developed an illness associated with AIDS or died after a year’ s treatment.
Epivir was also studied in 615 children.
The study compared the effects of Epivir taken with zidovudine to didanosine (another antiviral medicine) taken alone.
The study measured how long it took the children to develop an AIDS-related illness.
What benefit has Epivir shown during the studies?
All of the studies found that combinations including Epivir were more effective than the comparator medicines.
In the first four studies in adults, Epivir, taken in combination with zidovudine, increased CD4 cell counts more than the comparator medicines after 24 weeks of treatment.
The combination also reduced viral loads in all studies after two to four weeks of treatment, but this effect was temporary.
In the fifth adult study, adding Epivir to the existing treatment reduced the risk of disease progression or death:
128 (9%) of the 1,369 patients taking Epivir developed an AIDS-related illness or died, compared with 95 (20%) of the 471 patients taking placebo.
Similar results were seen in HIV- infected children.
What is the risk associated with Epivir?
The most common side effects with Epivir (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, headache, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), cough, nasal symptoms, rash, muscle disorders, arthralgia (joint pain), alopecia (hair loss), fever, abdominal (tummy) pain or cramps, malaise (feeling unwell) and fatigue (tiredness).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Epivir, see the Package Leaflet.
Epivir should not be used in patients with severe liver disease or who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to lamivudine or any of the other ingredients.
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Epivir may be at risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).
Patients who have problems with their liver (including hepatitis B or C infection) may be at an elevated risk of liver damage when taking Epivir.
As with all other NRTIs, Epivir may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Epivir during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
Why has Epivir been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Epivir’ s benefits are greater than its risks in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infected adults and children.
The Committee recommended that Epivir be given marketing authorisation.
Epivir was originally authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’, because, for scientific reasons, limited information was available at the time of approval.
As the company had supplied the additional information requested, the ‘ Exceptional Circumstances ’ ended on 7 January 1998.
Other information about Epivir:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Epivir to Glaxo Group Limited on 8 August 1996.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 8 August 2001 and on 8 August 2006.
