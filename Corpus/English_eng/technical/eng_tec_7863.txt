EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ONSENAL
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Onsenal?
Onsenal is a medicine that contains the active substance celecoxib.
It is available as white capsules (200 and 400 mg).
What is Onsenal used for?
Onsenal is used to reduce the number of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).
This is a genetic disease that causes ‘ adenomatous intestinal polyps’, growths that project from the lining of the large intestine or rectum.
Onsenal is used in addition to surgery (to remove the polyps) and endoscopic monitoring (to check if polyps are developing, using an endoscope, a thin tube that allows a doctor to look inside the gut).
Because the number of patients with FAP is low, the disease is considered ‘ rare’, and Onsenal was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 20 November 2001.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Onsenal used?
The recommended dose of Onsenal is 400 mg twice a day with food.
The usual medical care for FAP patients should be continued.
In patients with moderate liver disease, the dose of Onsenal should be halved, and it should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate kidney problems.
Onsenal must not be given to patients with severe liver or kidney problems.
It should be used with caution, possibly with a lower starting dose, in patients whose bodies may break Onsenal down slowly.
Special care should be taken when it is used in the elderly.
The maximum recommended daily dose of Onsenal is 800 mg.
How does Onsenal work?
The active substance in Onsenal, celecoxib, is a ‘ non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug’ (NSAID) that belongs to the group ‘ cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors’.
It blocks the COX-2 enzyme, resulting in a reduction in the production of prostaglandins, substances that are involved in processes such as inflammation and the activity of smooth muscle (muscle that performs automatic tasks such as the opening and closing of blood vessels).
COX-2 is found at high levels in adenomatous colorectal polyps.
By blocking the activity of COX-2, celecoxib helps to slow down the formation of polyps by stopping them developing their own blood supply and by increasing the rate of cell death.

How has Onsenal been studied?
Onsenal has been studied in one main study involving 83 adults with FAP, in which the effectiveness of two doses of Onsenal was compared with that of placebo (a dummy treatment).
In the study, 25 patients had an intact colon (lower gut), but the remainder had had some or all of their colon removed through surgery.
The main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the number of polyps in a defined area of the colon or rectum wall after six months of treatment.
An additional study looked at the effects of Onsenal in 18 children with FAP.
What benefit has Onsenal shown during the studies?
Onsenal at a dose of 400 mg twice a day was more effective than placebo.
In adults, Onsenal had reduced the average number of polyps by 28% after six months, while the number fell by 5% in the patients taking placebo.
Onsenal also reduced the number of polyps in children with FAP.
What is the risk associated with Onsenal?
The most common side effects with Onsenal (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are hypertension (high blood pressure) and diarrhoea.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Onsenal, see the Package Leaflet.
Onsenal should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to celecoxib, to any of the other ingredients, or to sulphonamides (such as some antibiotics).
It must not be used in patients who have an active ulcer or bleeding in the stomach or gut, or in patients who have had allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or an NSAID, including another COX-2 inhibitor.
Onsenal must not be given to pregnant women or women who could become pregnant unless they are using an effective method of contraception, or to women who are breast-feeding.
It must not be given to patients with severe liver or kidney disease, patients with a disease causing inflammation of the bowel, or patients with certain problems affecting the heart or blood vessels.
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
Why has Onsenal been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Onsenal’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the reduction of the number of adenomatous intestinal polyps in FAP as an adjunct to surgery and further endoscopic surveillance.
The Committee noted that no effect of the reduced number of polyps caused by Onsenal on the risk of developing cancer of the intestine had been shown.
The Committee recommended that Onsenal be given marketing authorisation.
Onsenal has been authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’.
This means that because the disease is rare, it has not been possible to obtain complete information about Onsenal.
Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary.
What information is still awaited for Onsenal?
The company that makes Onsenal will carry out a study in patients with FAP, in order to collect more information on the medicine ’ s safety and effectiveness.
Other information about Onsenal:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Onsenal on 17 October 2003.
The marketing authorisation holder is Pfizer Limited.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 17 October 2008.
