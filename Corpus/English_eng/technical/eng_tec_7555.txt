Maximum size of journal
Size of the journal at rotation in MB. Use -1 to disable rotating.
Location of journal pieces
Where to store a journal chunk when it hits the max size.
Log verbosity
Log verbosity.
Scheduler priority when idle
The scheduler is the kernel component that decides which runnable application will be executed by the CPU next. Each application has an associated scheduling policy and priority.
Max bytes to extract
Maximum number of UTF-8 bytes to extract.
Max media art width
Maximum width in pixels for any media art extracted. Anything bigger is resized. Set to -1 to disable saving media art from files. Setting to 0 sets no limit on the media art width.
Maximum length of a word to be indexed
Words with more characters than this length will be ignored by the indexer.
Maximum number of words to index in a document
Indexer will read only this maximum number of words from a single document.
Enable stemmer
Simplify the words to their root to provide more results. E.g. 'shelves' and 'shelf' to 'shel'
Enable unaccent
Translate accented characters to the equivalent unaccented. E.g. 'Idéa' to 'Idea' for improved matching.
Ignore numbers
If enabled, numbers will not be indexed.
Ignore stop words
If enabled, the words listed in the stop-words list are ignored. E.g. common words like 'the', 'yes', 'no', etc.
Initial sleep
Initial sleep time, in seconds.
Throttle
Indexing speed, the higher the slower.
Low disk space limit
Disk space threshold in MB at which to pause indexing, or -1 to disable.
Crawling interval
Interval in days to check whether the filesystem is up to date in the database. 0 forces crawling anytime, -1 forces it only after unclean shutdowns, and -2 disables it entirely.
Removable devices' data permanence threshold
Threshold in days after which files from removables devices will be removed from database if not mounted. 0 means never, maximum is 365.
Enable monitors
Set to false to completely disable any file monitoring
Enable writeback
Set to false to completely disable any file writeback
Index removable devices
Set to true to enable indexing mounted directories for removable devices.
Index optical discs
Set to true to enable indexing CDs, DVDs, and generally optical media (if removable devices are not indexed, optical discs won't be either)
Index when running on battery
Set to true to index while running on battery
Perform initial indexing when running on battery
Set to true to index while running on battery for the first time only
Directories to index recursively
List of directories to index recursively, Special values include: &DESKTOP, &DOCUMENTS, &DOWNLOAD, &MUSIC, &PICTURES, &PUBLIC_SHARE, &TEMPLATES, &VIDEOS. See /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults and $HOME/.config/user-dirs.default
Directories to index non-recursively
List of directories to index without inspecting subfolders, Special values include: &DESKTOP, &DOCUMENTS, &DOWNLOAD, &MUSIC, &PICTURES, &PUBLIC_SHARE, &TEMPLATES, &VIDEOS. See /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults and $HOME/.config/user-dirs.default

Semantics
The scheduler is the kernel component that decides which runnable application will be executed by the CPU next. Each application has an associated scheduling policy and priority.

This option allows you to make Tracker take a back seat and not eat up too much CPU time if you have other applications more deserving of it.

When resetting your indexed data, the databases are removed and your files will no longer be indexed. Upon next start, Tracker will then start indexing data as if it was being run for the first time.
