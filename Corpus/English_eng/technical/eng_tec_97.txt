Navigating Through Sheet Tabs
By default $[officename] displays three sheets &quot; Sheet1 &quot; to &quot; Sheet3 &quot; , in each new spreadsheet.
You can switch between sheets in a spreadsheet using the sheet tabs at the bottom of the screen.
Sheet Tabs
Icon
Use the navigation buttons to display all the sheets belonging to your document.
Clicking the button on the far left or the far right displays, respectively, the first or last sheet tab.
The middle buttons allow the user to scroll forwards and backwards through all sheet tabs.
To display the sheet itself click on the sheet tab.
If there is insufficient space to display all the sheet tabs, you can increase it by pointing to the separator between the scrollbar and the sheet tabs, pressing the mouse button and, keeping the mouse button pressed, dragging to the right.
In doing so you will be sharing the available space between the sheet tabs and horizontal scrollbar.
