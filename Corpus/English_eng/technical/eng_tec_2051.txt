In insert mode, the existing cells where you drop will be shifted to the right or to the bottom, and the dropped cells are inserted into the now empty positions without overwriting.
The surrounding box of the moved cells looks different in insert mode.
In overwrite mode you will see all four borders around the selected area.
In insert mode you will see only the left border when target cells will be shifted to the right.
You will see only the upper border when target cells will be shifted down.
Whether the target area will be shifted to the right or to the bottom depends on the distance between source and target cells, if you move within the same sheet.
It depends on the number of horizontal or vertical cells in the moved area, if you move to a different sheet.
If you move cells in insert mode within the same row (only horizontally), then after insertion of the cells, all cells will be shifted to the left to fill the source area.
