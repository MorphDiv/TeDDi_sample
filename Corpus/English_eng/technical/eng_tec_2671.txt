Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
A db+ + server will prepare a TCL interpreter for each client connection.
This interpreter will enable the server to execute TCL code provided by the client as a sort of stored procedures to improve the performance of database operations by avoiding client / server data transfers and context switches.
dbplus_tcl() needs to pass the client connection id the TCL script code should be executed by. dbplus_resolve() will provide this connection id.
The function will return whatever the TCL code returns or a TCL error message if the TCL code fails.
See also dbplus_resolve().
