Six months later, we've reached an early beta stage. We want to release now to start working on compatibility issues and cross-platform stability. Also, we feel now that the program is actually usable and would like to see other interested programmers developing plug-ins and various file format support.
The Early Days of GIMP
Version 0.54
Version 0.54 was released in February 1996, and had a major impact as the first truly professional free image manipulation program. This was the first free program that could compete with the big commercial image manipulation programs.
Version 0.54 was a beta release, but it was so stable that you could use it for daily work. However, one of the major drawbacks of 0.54 was that the toolkit (the slidebars, menus, dialog boxes, etc.) was built on Motif, a commercial toolkit. This was a big drawback for systems like
Version 0.60
When 0.60 was released in July 1996, it had been under S and P (Spencer and Peter) development for four months. Main programming advantages were the new toolkits,
Version 0.60 was only a developer's release, and was not intended for widespread use. It served as a workbench for 0.99 and the final 1.0 version, so functions and enhancement could be tested and dropped or changed. You can look at 0.60 as the alpha version of 0.99.
Version 0.99
In February 1997, 0.99 came on the scene. Together with other developers, S and P had made several changes to

What's New in GIMP 2.6?
GIMP 2.6 is an important release from a development point of view. It features changes to the user interface addressing some often received complaints, and a tentative integration of GEGL, the graph based image processing library that will eventually bring high bit-depth and non-destructive editing to GIMP.
User Interface
Toolbox Menubar removed
The toolbox menubar has been removed and merged with the image window menubar. To be able to do this a window called the empty image window has been introduced. It hosts the menubar and keeps the application instance alive when no images are opened. It also acts as a drag and drop target. When opening the first image the empty image window is transformed into a normal image window, and when closing the last image, that window becomes the empty image window.
New Look of the image window in GIMP 2.6
Toolbox and docks are utility windows
With the empty image window acting as a natural main window, the Toolbox and Docks windows are now utility windows rather than main windows. This enables window managers to do a much better job of managing the GIMP windows, including omitting the Toolbox and Docks from the taskbar and ensuring that the Toolbox and Docks always are above image windows.
Ability to scroll beyond image border
The Navigation dialog now allows panning beyond the image border; so it is no longer a problem to use a brush on the edge of an image that fills the entire display window. Also, if a utility window covers the image, you can pan the image to view or edit the portion covered by the utility window.
Scrolling beyond border
Minor changes
Renamed Dialogs menu to Windows.
Keep a list of recently closed Docks and allow reopening them.
Make opening images in already running GIMP instances work better on Windows.
You can now enter the image zoom ratio directly in the status bar.
Added support for using online help instead of a locally installed GIMP Help package.
Make it possible to lock tabs in docks to prevent accidental moving.
Tools, Filters and Plug-ins
Improved Free Select Tool
The freehand select tool has been enhanced to support polygonal selections. It also allows mixing free hand segments with polygonal segments, editing of existing segments, applying angle-constraints to segments, and of course the normal selection tool operations like add and subtract. Altogether this ends up making the Free Select Tool a very versatile, powerful and easy-to-use selection tool.
Polygonal Selection
Brush Dynamics
Brush dynamics uses an input dynamic such as pressure, velocity, or random, to modify brush parameters such as opacity, hardness, size, or color; every brush supports size and opacity, most support more. Velocity and random are usable with a mouse. The Ink tool, that supported velocity, has been overhauled to better handle velocity-dependent painting.
Brush dynamics have enabled a new feature in stroking paths. There is now a check box under the
Added a bounding box for the Text Tool that supports automatic wrapping of text within that bounding box.
Text tool bounding box
Move handles for rectangle based tools like Crop and Rectangle Select to the outside of the rectangle when the rectangle is narrow.
Rectangle handles
Added motion constraints to the Move Tool.
Improved event smoothing for paint tools.
Mark the center of rectangles while they are moved, and snap the center to grid and rulers.
Enable brush scaling for the Smudge tool.
Added ability to save presets in all color tools for color adjustments you use frequently.
Allow to transfer settings from
Allow changing opacity on transform tool previews.
The Screenshot plug-in has been given the ability to capture the mouse cursor (using Xfixes).
Display aspect ratio of the Crop and Rectangle Select Tool rectangles in the status bar.
Desaturate has been given an on-canvas preview.
The Flame plug-in has been extended with 22 new variations.
Data file folders like brush folders are searched recursively for files.
Replaced the PSD import plug-in with a rewritten version that does what the old version did plus some other things, for example reading of ICC color profiles.
Several displays use Cairo library.

Under the Hood
GEGL
Important progress towards high bit-depth and non-destructive editing in GIMP has been made. Most color operations in GIMP are now ported to the powerful graph based image processing framework GEGL
In addition to porting color operations to GEGL, an experimental GEGL Operation tool has been added, found in the Tools menu. It enables applying GEGL operations to an image and it gives on-canvas previews of the results. The screenshot below shows this for a Gaussian Blur.
GEGL operation
Ported many widgets to use the 2D graphics library cairo
Miscellaneous
Plug-in Development
There are new things for a plug-in developer to enjoy as well. For example, procedures can now give a detailed error description in case of an error, and the error can be propagated to the user.
GIMP 2.6 also further enhances its scripting abilities. In particular there is now a much richer API for the creation and manipulation of text layers. Here is a list of new symbols in GIMP 2.6:
Backwards Compatibility
Some old scripts could not be used with GIMP-2.4. This has been improved and 2.6 should run 2.0 and 2.2 scripts.
Known Problems
The Utility window hint is currently only known to work well in the Linux GNOME desktop environment and on Windows starting with GIMP 2.6.1.
Using the Text Tool is currently not an optimal experience. Making it work better is a goal for GIMP 2.8.

What's New in GIMP 2.4?
Refreshed Look
A whole new default icon theme has been created for 2.4. The icons comply with the Tango style guidelines so GIMP doesn't feel out of place on any of the supported platforms. Regardless of whether you run GIMP under Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X or Linux (GNOME, KDE or Xfce), GIMP provides a polished, consistent look.
New Look of the toolbox in GIMP 2.4
Additionally the icons also have enhanced usability on dark widget themes, which is a common setting among digital artists.
For artists preferring more desaturated color theme for their icons is an alternative icon theme available for download
Scalable Brushes
The tool options now include a brush size slider that affects both the parametric and bitmap brushes. This has been an oft-requested feature from both digital painters and photo editors.
Scalable brushes in GIMP 2.4
Unlike previous versions of GIMP, regardless of whether you're using a bitmap brush, parametric brush or even a picture tube (multiple bitmaps), you can easily set the brush size with either the tool options dock slider or an external device such as a MIDI slider or knob or a USB device like the Griffin Powermate.
Selection Tools
The selection tools have been rewritten from scratch to allow resizing of existing selections. Additionally the rectangular selection tool includes a setting for creating rounded corners as this has been identified as a very common task among web designers.
Selection tools in GIMP 2.4
The learning curve for the tools has been flattened as the key functionality is available without obscure shortcuts that confused GIMP beginners. Most of the existing shortcuts still work, but the functionality is either available through the tool options or made obsolete due to the interactive move and resize on canvas.
While the tools have been redesigned to make them easier to understand for the newbies, all the former functionality is there. You can still constrain aspect ratios or specific sizes.
Foreground Select Tool
Selecting individual objects on images is easier now with a new
Align Tool
While GIMP has provided a grid and guideline functionality, the actual alignment of objects had to be done manually. A new tool comes at rescue
Changes in menus
Most notable is the new top-level Color menu that accumulates most tools, plug-ins and scripts that adjust colors in RGB/Grayscale mode and color palettes in Indexed mode. So now you can reach functions like Levels or Curves much faster than before, unless you define your own keyboard shortcuts for them using the improved keyboard shortcuts manager.
In the new version of GIMP, some menu entries have changed their names and position. It was done mostly to simplify learning curve and improve user experience. After all, "HSV Noise" and "RGB Noise" sound more meaningful than "Scatter HSV" and "Scatter RGB", don't they? And status bar hints for all plug-ins and scripts are quite helpful too.
Support for file formats
Support for Photoshop ABR brush format;
Improved reading/writing EXIF in JPEG;
Importing clipping paths in TIFF;
Layer masks can be saved to PSD;
16/32 bit bitmaps and alpha-channel support in BMP;
24 bit and Vista icons can be opened and saved.
Fullscreen Editing
The fullscreen mode has been improved to not only allow getting a full scale preview of the artwork, but also allow comfortable editing. The artist has maximum screen estate available while all functionality is quickly accessible by pressing the
Whether painting or touching up photos, fullscreen editing keeps all the distracting elements out of sight on a key press. It's like observing stars in a field as opposed to a light-polluted city.
Color Management and Soft-proofing
GIMP now provides full support for color profiles allowing precise color modification throughout the whole
Color management in GIMP 2.4
New Crop Tool
Just like the selection tools, the new crop tool has been enhanced since the last release. The resize handles actually resize the crop rectangle instead of providing both resize and move functionality. The tool behaves more naturally and consistently with other GIMP tools. For details see
To move, simply drag the rectangle clicking within the area. Resizing is possible in one or two axes at the same time dragging the handle-bars on the sides and corners. The outside area is darkened with a nice passepartout effect to better get the idea of how the final crop will look like.
Red Eye Removal
While numerous red-eye workflows exist already, GIMP now features a very convenient auto-magic filter to remove red eye from your shots.
Healing Brush
The healing brush is a new tool, similar in the working of the clone tool, that permits to quickly fix small defects or imperfections due to scratching or dust. In fact the tool is smart enough to being able to
Perspective Clone
Here is another clone-like new tool that is able to adapt the destination geometry, instead of color as does the healing brush, based on preselected distortion settings. As the name suggests, perfect when copying images blocks with some type of prospective changes.
Lens Distortion
A very common problem exposing itself especially when using cheaper lenses is barrel distortion and vignetting. Luckily GIMP provides a brand new filter to compensate for both problems. Saving photographer's pocket is our mission!
Various Other Improvements
In addition to all the above, GIMP has been improved in other areas such as:
Better status information for tools in the window status bar.
Various speedups in composing functions and gradient drawing.
Zoomable preview widget for plugins.

Drag-and-drop support has been extended. You can now drop files and URIs onto an image window, where they will be opened in the existing image as new layers.
Please note, that Drag and Drop will not work for Apple Mac OS X between GIMP and the finder. This is due to a lack of functionality on Apples X11.app
Shortcut Editor
You can now edit your shortcuts in a dedicated dialog, as well as continue to use the little-known dynamic shortcuts feature (which has been there since 1.2).
Plug-in Previews
We have provided a standard preview widget for plug-in authors which greatly reduces the amount of code required to support previews. David Odin has integrated this widget into all the current filters, so that now many more filters in the

The second generation Path tool has a completely new interface. The first major difference you notice is that paths are no longer required to be closed. A path can be made up of a number of disjoint curve segments. The next major difference is that now the path tool has three different modes, Design, Edit and Move.
In Design mode, you can create a path, add nodes to an existing path and modify the shape of a curve either by dragging edges of the curve or dragging the
In Edit mode, you can add nodes in the middle of curve edges, and remove nodes or edges, as well as change the shape of the curve. You can also connect two path components.
The third mode, Move, is, as you might expect, used to move path components. If your path has several components, you can move each path component separately. To move all components at once, use the

VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
You may add a section Entitled
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in

Status
This field encodes the status of a bug report: whether it is still open, has been resolved, etc. You want to see all relevant bug reports, regardless of status, so you should hold down the mouse and sweep it across all entries. Leaving it alone will not work.

Reporting the Bug
Okay, so you have done everything you could to make sure, and you still think it's probably a bug. You should then go ahead and file a bug report on the Bugzilla page.
The first time you file a bug report, you will be asked to create a Bugzilla account. The process is easy and painless, and you probably won't even get any spam as a result.

Give a one-sentence summary that is descriptive enough so that somebody searching for similar bugs would find your bug report on the basis of the words this summary contains.
Description
Describe the problem. Be as specific as you can, and include all information that you think might possibly be relevant. The classic totally useless bug report is,

What Happens to a Bug Report after you Submit it
At any time after it is submitted, a bug report has a
Unconfirmed
This is the initial status of a bug report, from the time it is submitted until one of the maintainers reads it and decides whether it is really a valid bug report. Sometimes the maintainers aren't sure, and in the meantime leave the status as
New
This means that the bug report has been read by one of the maintainers, and is considered, for the moment at least, to be valid. It does not necessarily mean that anything is going to be done about it immediately: some bug reports, especially enhancement requests, may be perfectly valid and still go for a long time before anybody is able to deal with them. Many bugs, on the other hand, are fixed within hours of being reported.
Assigned
This means that a specific person has agreed to work on the bug. It does not, this world being the kind of world that it is, mean that that person will actually
Reopened
This means that the bug report was at some point considered by the maintainers to be resolved (i.e., finished), but new information came in that caused them to change their minds: most likely, a change that was intended to fix the problem did not completely work.
Needinfo
This is a status you should pay particular attention to. It means that you did not supply enough information in your bug report to enable anything to be done about it. In most cases, no further action will be taken on the bug report until you supply additional information (by adding a comment). If too much time goes by without any input from you, the bug report will eventually be resolved as
Resolved
This means that the maintainers believe that they have finished dealing with the bug report. If you disagree, you can re-open it, but since you cannot force anybody to work on a bug against their will, you should have a good reason for doing so. Bugs can be resolved in a variety of ways. Here are the possible values of
Fixed
The bug report is considered valid, and
Wontfix
The maintainers agree that the bug report is valid, but it would take so much effort to fix, in relation to its importance, that it is not worth the trouble.
Duplicate
This means that the same bug has already been reported by somebody else. If you see this resolution, you will also see a pointer to the earlier bug report, which will often give you a lot of useful information.
Notabug
This means that the behavior described in the bug report is intentional. It may seem like a bug to you (and there may be many people who agree with you), but the program is working the way it was intended to work, and the developers don't want to change it.
NotGnome
The bug report is valid, but it can't be addressed by changing
Incomplete
The bug report did not contain enough information for anything to be done about it, and the reporter did not respond to requests for more information. Usually a bug report will be open for at least a month or two before it is resolved in this way.
Invalid
Something is wrong with the form of the bug report: most commonly, the reporter has accidentally submitted the same bug report multiple times. (This can easily happen by mistake with some web browsers.) Bug reports that incorrectly describe how the program behaves may also be resolved as Invalid.
If you disagree with the resolution of a bug report, you are always free to add your comments to it. Any comment added to any bug report, resolved or not, causes email to be sent to the
