These functions all manipulate strings in various ways.
Some more specialized sections can be found in the regular expression and URL handling sections.
For information on how strings behave, especially with regard to usage of single quotes, double quotes, and escape sequences, see the Strings entry in the Types section of the manual.
No external libraries are needed to build this extension.
There is no installation needed to use these functions; they are part of the PHP core.
