Error Code
Message
Explanation
501
Invalid character
Character in a formula is not valid.
502
Invalid argument
Function argument is not valid, for example, a negative number for the root function.
503
#NUM!
Invalid floating point operation
A calculation results in an overflow of the defined value range.
504
Parameter list error
Function parameter is not valid, for example, text instead of a number, or a domain reference instead of cell reference.
508
Error:
Pair missing
Missing bracket, for example, closing brackets, but no opening brackets
509
Missing operator
Operator is missing, for example, &quot; =2(3+4) * &quot; , where the operator between &quot; 2 &quot; and &quot; ( &quot; is missing.
510
Missing variable
Variable is missing, for example when two operators are together &quot; =1+*2 &quot; .
511
Missing variable
Function requires more variables than are provided, for example, AND() and OR().
512
Formula overflow
Compiler:
the total number of internal tokens, (that is, operators, variables, brackets) in the formula exceeds 512.
513
String overflow
Compiler:
an identifier in the formula exceeds 64 KB in size.
Interpreter:
a result of a string operation exceeds 64 KB in size.
514
Internal overflow
Sort operation attempted on too much numerical data (maximum 100000) or a calculation stack overflow.
516
Internal syntax error
Matrix is expected on the calculation stack, but is not available.
517
Internal syntax error
Unknown code, for example, a document with a newer function is loaded in an older version that does not contain the function.
518
Internal syntax error
Variable is not available
519
#VALUE
No result (#VALUE is in the cell rather than Err:519!)
The formula yields a value that does not correspond to the definition, or a cell that is referenced in the formula contains text instead of a number.
520
Internal syntax error
Compiler creates an unknown compiler code.
521
Internal syntax error
No result.
522
Circular reference
Iterations
option is not set under Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME Calc - Calculate.
523
The calculation procedure does not converge
iterative references
do not reach the minimum change within the maximum number of steps set.
524
#REF
invalid references; error messages
error messages;invalid references
#REF error message
mw inserted &quot; error... &quot; entry
invalid references (instead of Err:524 cell contains #REF)
Compiler:
a column or row description name could not be resolved.
Interpreter:
in a formula, the column, row, or sheet that contains a referenced cell is missing.
525
#NAME?
invalid names; error messages
#NAME error message
invalid names (instead of Err:525 cell contains #NAME?)
An identifier could not be evaluated, for example, no valid reference, no valid domain name, no column/row label, no macro, incorrect decimal divider, add-in not found.
526
Internal syntax error
Obsolete, no longer used, but could come from old documents if the result is a formula from a domain.
527
Internal overflow
Interpreter:
References, such as when a cell references a cell, are too encapsulated.
532
#DIV/0!
Division by zero
