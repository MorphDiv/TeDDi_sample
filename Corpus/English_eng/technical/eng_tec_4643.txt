PHP Manual

(PHP 3 = 3.0.4, PHP 4)
Registers the function named by function to be executed when script processing is complete.
Multiple calls to register_shutdown_function() can be made, and each will be called in the same order as they were registered.
If you call exit() within one registered shutdown function, processing will stop completely and no other registered shutdown functions will be called.
The registered shutdown functions are called after the request has been completed (including sending any output buffers), so it is not possible to send output to the browser using echo() or print(), or retrieve the contents of any output buffers using ob_get_contents().
