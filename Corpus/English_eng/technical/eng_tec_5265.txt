Returning by-reference is useful when you want to use a function to find which variable a reference should be bound to.
When returning references, use this syntax:
function find_var ($param) {...code... return $found_var;} $foo = find_var ($bar); $foo - x = 2;
Note:
Unlike parameter passing, here you have to use in both places - to indicate that you return by-reference, not a copy as usual, and to indicate that reference binding, rather than usual assignment, should be done for $foo.
