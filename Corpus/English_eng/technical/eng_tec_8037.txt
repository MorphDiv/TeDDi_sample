4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
EXJADE is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥ 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older.
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups:
- in patients with other anaemias,
- in patients aged 2 to 5 years,
- in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood transfusions
(< 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with EXJADE should be initiated and maintained by physicians experienced in the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions.
It is recommended that treatment be started after the transfusion of approximately 20 units (about 100 ml/ kg) of packed red blood cells or when there is evidence from clinical monitoring that chronic iron overload is present (e. g. serum ferritin > 1,000 µg/ l).
Doses (in mg/ kg) must be calculated and rounded to the nearest whole tablet size.
The goals of iron chelation therapy are to remove the amount of iron administered in transfusions and, as required, to reduce the existing iron burden.
Starting dose U
The recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE is 20 mg/ kg body weight.
An initial daily dose of 30 mg/ kg may be considered for patients who require reduction of elevated body iron levels and who are also receiving more than 14 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells (approximately > 4 units/ month for an adult).
2 An initial daily dose of 10 mg/ kg may be considered for patients who do not require reduction of body iron levels and who are also receiving less than 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells (approximately < 2 units/ month for an adult).
The patient’ s response must be monitored and a dose increase should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1).
For patients already well managed on treatment with deferoxamine, a starting dose of EXJADE that is numerically half that of the deferoxamine dose could be considered (e. g. a patient receiving 40 mg/ kg/ day of deferoxamine for 5 days per week (or equivalent) could be transferred to a starting daily dose of 20 mg/ kg/ day of EXJADE).
When this results in a daily dose less than 20 mg/ kg body weight, the patient’ s response must be monitored and a dose increase should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1).
Maintenance dose U
It is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month and that the dose of EXJADE be adjusted, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on the trends in serum ferritin.
Dose adjustments may be made in steps of 5 to 10 mg/ kg and are to be tailored to the individual patient’ s response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of iron burden).
Doses above 30 mg/ kg are not recommended because there is only limited experience with doses above this level.
If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/ l, an interruption of treatment should be considered (see section 4.4).
Preparation U
EXJADE must be taken once daily on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before food, preferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).
The tablets are dispersed by stirring in a glass of water or orange or apple juice (100 to 200 ml) until a fine suspension is obtained.
After the suspension has been swallowed, any residue must be resuspended in a small volume of water or juice and swallowed.
The tablets must not be chewed or swallowed whole (see also section 6.2).
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) U
The dosing recommendations for elderly patients are the same as described above.
Paediatric patients (2 to 17 years of age) U
The dosing recommendations for paediatric patients are the same as for adult patients.
Changes in weight of paediatric patients over time must be taken into account when calculating the dose.
In children aged between 2 and 5 years, exposure is lower than in adults (see section 5.2).
This age group may therefore require higher doses than are necessary in adults.
However, the initial dose should be the same as in adults, followed by individual titration.
Patients with renal impairment U
EXJADE has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and is contraindicated in patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Patients with hepatic impairment U
EXJADE has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and must be used with caution in such patients.
The initial dosing recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment are the same as described above.
Hepatic function in all patients should be monitored before treatment then every month (see section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Combination with other iron chelator therapies as the safety of such combinations has not been established (see section 4.5).
Patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min.
3 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Renal function:
U
EXJADE has been studied only in patients with baseline serum creatinine within the age-appropriate normal range.
During clinical trials, increases in serum creatinine of > 33% on ≥ 2 consecutive occasions, sometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients.
These were dose- dependent.
About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below the 33% level without dose adjustment.
In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not always respond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption.
Cases of acute renal failure have been reported following post-marketing use of EXJADE (see section 4.8).
The causes of the rises in serum creatinine have not been elucidated.
Particular attention should therefore be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are receiving high doses of EXJADE and/ or low rates of transfusion (< 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells or < 2 units/ month for an adult).
It is recommended that serum creatinine be assessed in duplicate before initiating therapy.
Serum creatinine, creatinine clearance (estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD formula in adults and with the Schwartz formula in children) and/ or plasma cystatin C levels should be monitored weekly in the first month after initiation or modification of therapy with EXJADE, and monthly thereafter.
Patients with pre-existing renal conditions and patients who are receiving medicinal products that depress renal function may be more at risk of complications.
Care should be taken to maintain adequate hydration in patients who develop diarrhoea or vomiting.
For adult patients, the daily dose may be reduced by 10 mg/ kg if a rise in serum creatinine by > 33% above the average of the pre-treatment measurements and estimated creatinine clearance decreases below the lower limit of the normal range (< 90 ml/ min) are seen at two consecutive visits, and cannot be attributed to other causes (see section 4.2).
For paediatric patients, the dose may be reduced by 10 mg/ kg if estimated creatinine clearance decreases below the lower limit of the normal range (< 90 ml/ min) and/ or serum creatinine levels rise above the age-appropriate upper limit of normal at two consecutive visits.
After a dose reduction, for adult and paediatric patients, treatment should be interrupted if a rise in serum creatinine > 33% above the average of the pre-treatment measurements is observed and/ or the calculated creatinine clearance falls below the lower limit of the normal range.
Treatment may be reinitiated depending on the individual clinical circumstances.
Particular attention should also be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are concomitantly receiving medicinal products that depress renal function.
Tests for proteinuria should be performed monthly.
As needed, additional markers of renal tubular function (e. g. glycosuria in non-diabetics and low levels of serum potassium, phosphate, magnesium or urate, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria) may also be monitored.
Dose reduction or interruption may be considered if there are abnormalities in levels of tubular markers and/ or if clinically indicated.
If, despite dose reduction and interruption, the serum creatinine remains significantly elevated and there is also persistent abnormality in another marker of renal function (e. g. proteinuria, Fanconi’ s Syndrome), the patient should be referred to a renal specialist, and further specialised investigations (such as renal biopsy) may be considered.
4 Hepatic function:
U U
Liver function test elevations have been observed in patients treated with EXJADE.
Postmarketing cases of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with EXJADE.
Most reports of hepatic failure involved patients with significant morbidities including pre-existing liver cirrhosis.
However, the role of EXJADE as a contributing or aggravating factor cannot be excluded (see section 4.8).
It is recommended that serum transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase be checked before the initiation of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and monthly thereafter.
If there is a persistent and progressive increase in serum transaminase levels that cannot be attributed to other causes, EXJADE should be interrupted.
Once the cause of the liver function test abnormalities has been clarified or after return to normal levels, cautious re-initiation of treatment at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation may be considered.
EXJADE is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it has not been studied in such patients.
Treatment has been initiated only in patients with baseline liver transaminase levels up to 5 times the upper limit of the normal range (see section 5.2).
Upper gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children and adolescents, receiving EXJADE.
Multiple ulcers have been observed in some patients (see section 4.8).
Physicians and patients should remain alert for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage during EXJADE therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious gastrointestinal adverse event is suspected.
Caution should be exercised in patients who are taking EXJADE in combination with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids, or oral bisphosphonates and in patients receiving anticoagulants (see section 4.5).
Skin rashes may appear during EXJADE treatment.
The rashes resolve spontaneously in most cases.
When interruption of treatment may be necessary, treatment may be reintroduced after resolution of the rash, at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation.
In severe cases this reintroduction could be conducted in combination with a short period of oral steroid administration.
Cases of serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported in patients receiving EXJADE, with the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment (see section 4.8).
If such reactions occur, EXJADE should be discontinued and appropriate medical intervention instituted.
Auditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) disturbances have been reported (see section 4.8).
Auditory and ophthalmic testing (including fundoscopy) is recommended before the start of treatment and at regular intervals thereafter (every 12 months).
If disturbances are noted during the treatment, dose reduction or interruption may be considered.
There have been post-marketing reports of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia, or aggravation of these cytopenias in patients treated with EXJADE.
Most of these patients had pre- existing haematological disorders that are frequently associated with bone marrow failure.
However, a contributory or aggravating role cannot be excluded.
Interruption of treatment should be considered in patients who develop unexplained cytopenia.
Monthly monitoring of serum ferritin is recommended in order to assess the patient’ s response to therapy (see section 4.2).
If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/ l, an interruption of treatment should be considered.
5 The results of the tests for serum creatinine, serum ferritin and serum transaminases should be recorded and regularly assessed for trends.
The results should also be noted in the provided patient’ s booklet.
In the 1-year clinical studies growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with EXJADE were not affected.
However, as a general precautionary measure in the management of paediatric patients with transfusional iron overload, body weight, height and sexual development should be monitored at regular intervals (every 12 months).
Cardiac dysfunction is a known complication of severe iron overload.
Cardiac function should be monitored in patients with severe iron overload during long-term treatment with EXJADE.
The tablets contain lactose (1.1 mg lactose for each mg of deferasirox).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or severe lactase deficiency should not take this medicine.
The concomitant use of deferasirox with aluminium-containing antacid preparations is not recommended.
Caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with strong UDP- glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) inducers, or CYP2C8 substrates (see section 4.5).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The concomitant administration of EXJADE and aluminium-containing antacid preparations has not been formally studied.
Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminium than for iron, it is not recommended to take EXJADE tablets with aluminium-containing antacid preparations (see section 4.4).
The bioavailability of deferasirox was increased to a variable extent when taken along with food.
EXJADE must therefore be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before food, preferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Deferasirox metabolism depends on UGT enzymes.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of EXJADE (single dose of 30 mg/ kg) and the potent UGT inducer, rifampicin, (repeated dose of 600 mg/ day) resulted in a decrease of deferasirox exposure by 44% (90% CI:
37% - 51%).
Therefore, the concomitant use of EXJADE with potent UGT inducers (e. g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) may result in a decrease in EXJADE efficacy (see section 4.4).
The patient ’ s serum ferritin should be monitored during and after the combination, and the dose of EXJADE adjusted if necessary.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of EXJADE and midazolam (a CYP3A4 probe substrate) resulted in a decrease of midazolam exposure by 17% (90% CI:
8% - 26%).
In the clinical setting, this effect may be more pronounced.
Therefore, due to a possible decrease in efficacy, caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with substances metabolised through CYP3A4 (e. g. ciclosporin, simvastatin, hormonal contraceptive agents, bepridil, ergotamine).
The safety of EXJADE in combination with other iron chelators has not been established.
Therefore, it must not be combined with other iron chelator therapies (see section 4.3).
No interaction was observed between EXJADE and digoxin in healthy adult volunteers.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor (30 mg/ kg daily), with repaglinide, a CYP2C8 substrate, given as a single dose of 0.5 mg, increased repaglinide AUC and C max about 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) and 1.6-fold (90% CI
B
B
[1.42-1.84]), respectively.
Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should be avoided.
If the combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be performed
6 (see section 4.4).
An interaction between deferasirox and other CYP2C8 substrates like paclitaxel cannot be excluded (see section 4.4).
The concomitant administration of EXJADE and vitamin C has not been formally studied.
Doses of vitamin C up to 200 mg per day have not been associated with adverse consequences.
The concomitant administration of EXJADE with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid at high dosage), corticosteroids or oral bisphosphonates may increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.4).
The concomitant administration of EXJADE with anticoagulants may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
Close clinical monitoring is required when deferasirox is combined with these substances.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy U
No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for deferasirox.
Studies in animals have shown some reproductive toxicity at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
As a precaution, it is recommended that EXJADE not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Lactation U
In animal studies, deferasirox was found to be rapidly and extensively secreted into maternal milk.
No effect on the offspring was noted.
It is not known if deferasirox is secreted into human milk.
Breast- feeding while taking EXJADE is not recommended.
Fertility U
No fertility data is available for humans.
In animals, no adverse effects on male or female fertility were found (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects of EXJADE on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Patients experiencing the uncommon adverse reaction of dizziness should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent reactions reported during chronic treatment with EXJADE in adult and paediatric patients include gastrointestinal disturbances in about 26% of patients (mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain) and skin rash in about 7% of patients.
Diarrhoea is reported more commonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years than in older patients.
These reactions are dose- dependent, mostly mild to moderate, generally transient and mostly resolve even if treatment is continued.
During clinical trials, increases in serum creatinine of > 33% on ≥ 2 consecutive occasions, sometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients.
These were dose- dependent.
About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below the 33% level without dose adjustment.
In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not always respond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption.
Indeed, in some cases, only a stabilisation of the serum creatinine values has been observed after dose reduction (see section 4.4).
7 Gallstones and related biliary disorders were reported in about 2% of patients.
Elevations of liver transaminases were reported as an adverse drug reaction in 2% of patients.
Elevations of transaminases greater than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, suggestive of hepatitis, were uncommon (0.3%).
During postmarketing experience, hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, has been reported with EXJADE, especially in patients with pre-existing liver cirrhosis (see section 4.4).
As with other iron chelator treatment, high-frequency hearing loss and lenticular opacities (early cataracts) have been uncommonly observed in patients treated with EXJADE (see section 4.4).
Adverse reactions are ranked below using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000); not known (cannot be estimated form the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

8 4.9 Overdose
Cases of overdose (2-3 times the prescribed dose for several weeks) have been reported.
In one case, this resulted in subclinical hepatitis which resolved after a dose interruption.
Single doses of 80 mg/ kg in iron-overloaded thalassaemic patients caused mild nausea and diarrhoea.
Acute signs of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, headache and diarrhoea.
Overdose may be treated by induction of emesis or by gastric lavage, and by symptomatic treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Iron chelating agent, ATC code:
V03AC03
Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is highly selective for iron (III).
It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio.
Deferasirox promotes excretion of iron, primarily in the faeces.
Deferasirox has low affinity for zinc and copper, and does not cause constant low serum levels of these metals.
In an iron-balance metabolic study in iron-overloaded adult thalassaemic patients, EXJADE at daily doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/ kg induced the mean net excretion of 0.119, 0.329 and 0.445 mg Fe/ kg body weight/ day, respectively.
EXJADE has been investigated in 411 adult (age ≥ 16 years) and 292 paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 16 years) with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions.
Of the paediatric patients 52 were aged 2 to 5 years.
The underlying conditions requiring transfusion included beta-thalassaemia, sickle cell disease and other congenital and acquired anaemias (myelodysplastic syndromes, Diamond- Blackfan syndrome, aplastic anaemia and other very rare anaemias).
Daily treatment at doses of 20 and 30 mg/ kg for one year in frequently transfused adult and paediatric patients with beta-thalassaemia led to reductions in indicators of total body iron; liver iron concentration was reduced by about -0.4 and -8.9 mg Fe/ g liver (biopsy dry weight (dw)) on average, respectively, and serum ferritin was reduced by about -36 and -926 µg/ l on average, respectively.
At these same doses the ratios of iron excretion: iron intake were 1.02 (indicating net iron balance) and 1.67 (indicating net iron removal), respectively.
EXJADE induced similar responses in iron- overloaded patients with other anaemias.
Daily doses of 10 mg/ kg for one year could maintain liver iron and serum ferritin levels and induce net iron balance in patients receiving infrequent transfusions or exchange transfusions.
Serum ferritin assessed by monthly monitoring reflected changes in liver iron concentration indicating that trends in serum ferritin can be used to monitor response to therapy.
Limited clinical data (29 patients with normal cardiac function at baseline) using MRI indicate that treatment with EXJADE 10-30 mg/ kg/ day for 1 year may also reduce levels of iron in the heart (on average, MRI T2* increased from 18.3 to 23.0 milliseconds).
The principal analysis of the pivotal comparative study in 586 patients suffering from beta- thalassaemia and transfusional iron overload did not demonstrate non-inferiority of EXJADE to deferoxamine in the analysis of the total patient population.
It appeared from a post-hoc analysis of this study that, in the subgroup of patients with liver iron concentration ≥ 7 mg Fe/ g dw treated with EXJADE (20 and 30 mg/ kg) or deferoxamine (35 to ≥ 50 mg/ kg), the non-inferiority criteria were achieved.
However, in patients with liver iron concentration < 7 mg Fe/ g dw treated with EXJADE (5 and 10 mg/ kg) or deferoxamine (20 to 35 mg/ kg), non-inferiority was not established due to imbalance in the dosing of the two chelators.
This imbalance occurred because patients on deferoxamine were allowed to remain on their pre-study dose even if it was higher than the protocol specified dose.
Fifty- six patients under the age of 6 years participated in this pivotal study, 28 of them receiving EXJADE.
9 It appeared from preclinical and clinical studies that EXJADE could be as active as deferoxamine when used in a dose ratio of 2:1 (i. e. a dose of EXJADE that is numerically half of the deferoxamine dose).
However, this dosing recommendation was not prospectively assessed in the clinical trials.
In addition, in patients with liver iron concentration ≥ 7 mg Fe/ g dw with various rare anaemias or sickle cell disease, EXJADE up to 20 and 30 mg/ kg produced a decrease in liver iron concentration and serum ferritin comparable to that obtained in patients with beta-thalassaemia.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption U
Deferasirox is absorbed following oral administration with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) of about 1.5 to 4 hours.
The absolute bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox from
B
B
EXJADE tablets is about 70% compared to an intravenous dose.
Total exposure (AUC) was approximately doubled when taken along with a high-fat breakfast (fat content > 50% of calories) and by about 50% when taken along with a standard breakfast.
The bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox was moderately (approx.
13– 25%) elevated when taken 30 minutes before meals with normal or high fat content.
Distribution U U
Deferasirox is highly (99%) protein bound to plasma proteins, almost exclusively serum albumin, and has a small volume of distribution of approximately 14 litres in adults.
Biotransformation U U
Glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion.
Deconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) is likely to occur.
Deferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3.
CYP450-catalysed (oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%).
No inhibition of deferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea was observed in vitro.
Elimination U U
Deferasirox and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the faeces (84% of the dose).
Renal excretion of deferasirox and its metabolites is minimal (8% of the dose).
The mean elimination half-life (t 1/ 2)
B
B
ranged from 8 to 16 hours.
The transporters MRP2 and MXR (BCRP) are involved in the biliary excretion of deferasirox.
Linearity / non-linearity U
The C max and AUC 0-24h of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose under steady-state
B B B
B
conditions.
Upon multiple dosing exposure increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3.
Characteristics in patients U
Paediatric patients The overall exposure of adolescents (12 to ≤ 17 years) and children (2 to < 12 years) to deferasirox after single and multiple doses was lower than that in adult patients.
In children younger than 6 years old exposure was about 50% lower than in adults.
Since dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical consequences.
Gender Females have a moderately lower apparent clearance (by 17.5%) for deferasirox compared to males.
Since dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical consequences.
Elderly patients The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in elderly patients (aged 65 or older).
10 Renal or hepatic impairment The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox were not influenced by liver transaminase levels up to 5 times the upper limit of the normal range.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for patients with iron overload, based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential.
The main findings were kidney toxicity and lens opacity (cataracts).
Similar findings were observed in neonatal and juvenile animals.
The kidney toxicity is considered mainly due to iron deprivation in animals that were not previously overloaded with iron.
Tests of genotoxicity in vitro were either negative (Ames test, chromosomal aberration test) or positive (V79 screen).
Deferasirox caused formation of micronuclei in vivo in the bone marrow, but not liver, of non-iron-loaded rats at lethal doses.
No such effects were observed in iron-preloaded rats.
Deferasirox was not carcinogenic when administered to rats in a 2-year study and transgenic p53+/ - heterozygous mice in a 6-month study.
The potential for toxicity to reproduction was assessed in rats and rabbits.
Deferasirox was not teratogenic, but caused increased frequency of skeletal variations and stillborn pups in rats at high doses that were severely toxic to the non-iron-overloaded mother.
Deferasirox did not cause other effects on fertility or reproduction.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
EXJADE is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥ 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older.
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups:
- in patients with other anaemias,
- in patients aged 2 to 5 years,
- in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood transfusions
(< 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with EXJADE should be initiated and maintained by physicians experienced in the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions.
It is recommended that treatment be started after the transfusion of approximately 20 units (about 100 ml/ kg) of packed red blood cells or when there is evidence from clinical monitoring that chronic iron overload is present (e. g. serum ferritin > 1,000 µg/ l).
Doses (in mg/ kg) must be calculated and rounded to the nearest whole tablet size.
The goals of iron chelation therapy are to remove the amount of iron administered in transfusions and, as required, to reduce the existing iron burden.
Starting dose U
The recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE is 20 mg/ kg body weight.
An initial daily dose of 30 mg/ kg may be considered for patients who require reduction of elevated body iron levels and who are also receiving more than 14 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells (approximately > 4 units/ month for an adult).
13 An initial daily dose of 10 mg/ kg may be considered for patients who do not require reduction of body iron levels and who are also receiving less than 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells (approximately < 2 units/ month for an adult).
The patient’ s response must be monitored and a dose increase should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1).
For patients already well managed on treatment with deferoxamine, a starting dose of EXJADE that is numerically half that of the deferoxamine dose could be considered (e. g. a patient receiving 40 mg/ kg/ day of deferoxamine for 5 days per week (or equivalent) could be transferred to a starting daily dose of 20 mg/ kg/ day of EXJADE).
When this results in a daily dose less than 20 mg/ kg body weight, the patient’ s response must be monitored and a dose increase should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1).
Maintenance dose U
It is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month and that the dose of EXJADE be adjusted, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on the trends in serum ferritin.
Dose adjustments may be made in steps of 5 to 10 mg/ kg and are to be tailored to the individual patient’ s response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of iron burden).
Doses above 30 mg/ kg are not recommended because there is only limited experience with doses above this level.
If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/ l, an interruption of treatment should be considered (see section 4.4).
Preparation U
EXJADE must be taken once daily on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before food, preferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).
The tablets are dispersed by stirring in a glass of water or orange or apple juice (100 to 200 ml) until a fine suspension is obtained.
After the suspension has been swallowed, any residue must be resuspended in a small volume of water or juice and swallowed.
The tablets must not be chewed or swallowed whole (see also section 6.2).
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) U
The dosing recommendations for elderly patients are the same as described above.
Paediatric patients (2 to 17 years of age) U
The dosing recommendations for paediatric patients are the same as for adult patients.
Changes in weight of paediatric patients over time must be taken into account when calculating the dose.
In children aged between 2 and 5 years, exposure is lower than in adults (see section 5.2).
This age group may therefore require higher doses than are necessary in adults.
However, the initial dose should be the same as in adults, followed by individual titration.
Patients with renal impairment U
EXJADE has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and is contraindicated in patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Patients with hepatic impairment U
EXJADE has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and must be used with caution in such patients.
The initial dosing recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment are the same as described above.
Hepatic function in all patients should be monitored before treatment then every month (see section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Combination with other iron chelator therapies as the safety of such combinations has not been established (see section 4.5).
Patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min.
14 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Renal function:
U
EXJADE has been studied only in patients with baseline serum creatinine within the age-appropriate normal range.
During clinical trials, increases in serum creatinine of > 33% on ≥ 2 consecutive occasions, sometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients.
These were dose- dependent.
About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below the 33% level without dose adjustment.
In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not always respond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption.
Cases of acute renal failure have been reported following post-marketing use of EXJADE (see section 4.8).
The causes of the rises in serum creatinine have not been elucidated.
Particular attention should therefore be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are receiving high doses of EXJADE and/ or low rates of transfusion (< 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells or < 2 units/ month for an adult).
It is recommended that serum creatinine be assessed in duplicate before initiating therapy.
Serum creatinine, creatinine clearance (estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD formula in adults and with the Schwartz formula in children) and/ or plasma cystatin C levels should be monitored weekly in the first month after initiation or modification of therapy with EXJADE, and monthly thereafter.
Patients with pre-existing renal conditions and patients who are receiving medicinal products that depress renal function may be more at risk of complications.
Care should be taken to maintain adequate hydration in patients who develop diarrhoea or vomiting.
For adult patients, the daily dose may be reduced by 10 mg/ kg if a rise in serum creatinine by > 33% above the average of the pre-treatment measurements and estimated creatinine clearance decreases below the lower limit of the normal range (< 90 ml/ min) are seen at two consecutive visits, and cannot be attributed to other causes (see section 4.2).
For paediatric patients, the dose may be reduced by 10 mg/ kg if estimated creatinine clearance decreases below the lower limit of the normal range (< 90 ml/ min) and/ or serum creatinine levels rise above the age-appropriate upper limit of normal at two consecutive visits.
After a dose reduction, for adult and paediatric patients, treatment should be interrupted if a rise in serum creatinine > 33% above the average of the pre-treatment measurements is observed and/ or the calculated creatinine clearance falls below the lower limit of the normal range.
Treatment may be reinitiated depending on the individual clinical circumstances.
Particular attention should also be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are concomitantly receiving medicinal products that depress renal function.
Tests for proteinuria should be performed monthly.
As needed, additional markers of renal tubular function (e. g. glycosuria in non-diabetics and low levels of serum potassium, phosphate, magnesium or urate, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria) may also be monitored.
Dose reduction or interruption may be considered if there are abnormalities in levels of tubular markers and/ or if clinically indicated.
If, despite dose reduction and interruption, the serum creatinine remains significantly elevated and there is also persistent abnormality in another marker of renal function (e. g. proteinuria, Fanconi’ s Syndrome), the patient should be referred to a renal specialist, and further specialised investigations (such as renal biopsy) may be considered.
15 Hepatic function:
U U
Liver function test elevations have been observed in patients treated with EXJADE.
Postmarketing cases of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with EXJADE.
Most reports of hepatic failure involved patients with significant morbidities including pre-existing liver cirrhosis.
However, the role of EXJADE as a contributing or aggravating factor cannot be excluded (see section 4.8).
It is recommended that serum transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase be checked before the initiation of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and monthly thereafter.
If there is a persistent and progressive increase in serum transaminase levels that cannot be attributed to other causes, EXJADE should be interrupted.
Once the cause of the liver function test abnormalities has been clarified or after return to normal levels, cautious re-initiation of treatment at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation may be considered.
EXJADE is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it has not been studied in such patients.
Treatment has been initiated only in patients with baseline liver transaminase levels up to 5 times the upper limit of the normal range (see section 5.2).
Upper gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children and adolescents, receiving EXJADE.
Multiple ulcers have been observed in some patients (see section 4.8).
Physicians and patients should remain alert for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage during EXJADE therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious gastrointestinal adverse event is suspected.
Caution should be exercised in patients who are taking EXJADE in combination with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids, or oral bisphosphonates and in patients receiving anticoagulants (see section 4.5).
Skin rashes may appear during EXJADE treatment.
The rashes resolve spontaneously in most cases.
When interruption of treatment may be necessary, treatment may be reintroduced after resolution of the rash, at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation.
In severe cases this reintroduction could be conducted in combination with a short period of oral steroid administration.
Cases of serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported in patients receiving EXJADE, with the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment (see section 4.8).
If such reactions occur, EXJADE should be discontinued and appropriate medical intervention instituted.
Auditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) disturbances have been reported (see section 4.8).
Auditory and ophthalmic testing (including fundoscopy) is recommended before the start of treatment and at regular intervals thereafter (every 12 months).
If disturbances are noted during the treatment, dose reduction or interruption may be considered.
There have been post-marketing reports of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia, or aggravation of these cytopenias in patients treated with EXJADE.
Most of these patients had pre- existing haematological disorders that are frequently associated with bone marrow failure.
However, a contributory or aggravating role cannot be excluded.
Interruption of treatment should be considered in patients who develop unexplained cytopenia.
Monthly monitoring of serum ferritin is recommended in order to assess the patient’ s response to therapy (see section 4.2).
If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/ l, an interruption of treatment should be considered.
16 The results of the tests for serum creatinine, serum ferritin and serum transaminases should be recorded and regularly assessed for trends.
The results should also be noted in the provided patient’ s booklet.
In the 1-year clinical studies growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with EXJADE were not affected.
However, as a general precautionary measure in the management of paediatric patients with transfusional iron overload, body weight, height and sexual development should be monitored at regular intervals (every 12 months).
Cardiac dysfunction is a known complication of severe iron overload.
Cardiac function should be monitored in patients with severe iron overload during long-term treatment with EXJADE.
The tablets contain lactose (1.1 mg lactose for each mg of deferasirox).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or severe lactase deficiency should not take this medicine.
The concomitant use of deferasirox with aluminium-containing antacid preparations is not recommended.
Caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with strong UDP- glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) inducers, or CYP2C8 substrates (see section 4.5).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The concomitant administration of EXJADE and aluminium-containing antacid preparations has not been formally studied.
Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminium than for iron, it is not recommended to take EXJADE tablets with aluminium-containing antacid preparations (see section 4.4).
The bioavailability of deferasirox was increased to a variable extent when taken along with food.
EXJADE must therefore be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before food, preferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Deferasirox metabolism depends on UGT enzymes.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of EXJADE (single dose of 30 mg/ kg) and the potent UGT inducer, rifampicin, (repeated dose of 600 mg/ day) resulted in a decrease of deferasirox exposure by 44% (90% CI:
37% - 51%).
Therefore, the concomitant use of EXJADE with potent UGT inducers (e. g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) may result in a decrease in EXJADE efficacy (see section 4.4).
The patient ’ s serum ferritin should be monitored during and after the combination, and the dose of EXJADE adjusted if necessary.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of EXJADE and midazolam (a CYP3A4 probe substrate) resulted in a decrease of midazolam exposure by 17% (90% CI:
8% - 26%).
In the clinical setting, this effect may be more pronounced.
Therefore, due to a possible decrease in efficacy, caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with substances metabolised through CYP3A4 (e. g. ciclosporin, simvastatin, hormonal contraceptive agents, bepridil, ergotamine).
The safety of EXJADE in combination with other iron chelators has not been established.
Therefore, it must not be combined with other iron chelator therapies (see section 4.3).
No interaction was observed between EXJADE and digoxin in healthy adult volunteers.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor (30 mg/ kg/ daily), with repaglinide, a CYP2C8 substrate, given as a single dose of 0.5 mg, increased repaglinide AUC and C max about 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) and 1.6-fold (90% CI
B
B
[1.42-1.84]), respectively.
Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should be avoided.
If the combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be performed
17 (see section 4.4).
An interaction between deferasirox and other CYP2C8 substrates like paclitaxel cannot be excluded (see section 4.4).
The concomitant administration of EXJADE and vitamin C has not been formally studied.
Doses of vitamin C up to 200 mg per day have not been associated with adverse consequences.
The concomitant administration of EXJADE with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid at high dosage), corticosteroids or oral bisphosphonates may increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.4).
The concomitant administration of EXJADE with anticoagulants may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
Close clinical monitoring is required when deferasirox is combined with these substances.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy U
No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for deferasirox.
Studies in animals have shown some reproductive toxicity at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
As a precaution, it is recommended that EXJADE not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Lactation U
In animal studies, deferasirox was found to be rapidly and extensively secreted into maternal milk.
No effect on the offspring was noted.
It is not known if deferasirox is secreted into human milk.
Breast- feeding while taking EXJADE is not recommended.
Fertility U
No fertility data is available for humans.
In animals, no adverse effects on male or female fertility were found (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects of EXJADE on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Patients experiencing the uncommon adverse reaction of dizziness should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent reactions reported during chronic treatment with EXJADE in adult and paediatric patients include gastrointestinal disturbances in about 26% of patients (mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain) and skin rash in about 7% of patients.
Diarrhoea is reported more commonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years than in older patients.
These reactions are dose- dependent, mostly mild to moderate, generally transient and mostly resolve even if treatment is continued.
During clinical trials, increases in serum creatinine of > 33% on ≥ 2 consecutive occasions, sometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients.
These were dose- dependent.
About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below the 33% level without dose adjustment.
In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not always respond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption.
Indeed, in some cases, only a stabilisation of the serum creatinine values has been observed after dose reduction (see section 4.4).
18 Gallstones and related biliary disorders were reported in about 2% of patients.
Elevations of liver transaminases were reported as an adverse drug reaction in 2% of patients.
Elevations of transaminases greater than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, suggestive of hepatitis, were uncommon (0.3%).
During postmarketing experience, hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, has been reported with EXJADE, especially in patients with pre-existing liver cirrhosis (see section 4.4).
As with other iron chelator treatment, high-frequency hearing loss and lenticular opacities (early cataracts) have been uncommonly observed in patients treated with EXJADE (see section 4.4).
Adverse reactions are ranked below using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000); not known (cannot be estimated form the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

19 4.9 Overdose
Cases of overdose (2-3 times the prescribed dose for several weeks) have been reported.
In one case, this resulted in subclinical hepatitis which resolved after a dose interruption.
Single doses of 80 mg/ kg in iron-overloaded thalassaemic patients caused mild nausea and diarrhoea.
Acute signs of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, headache and diarrhoea.
Overdose may be treated by induction of emesis or by gastric lavage, and by symptomatic treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Iron chelating agent, ATC code:
V03AC03
Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is highly selective for iron (III).
It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio.
Deferasirox promotes excretion of iron, primarily in the faeces.
Deferasirox has low affinity for zinc and copper, and does not cause constant low serum levels of these metals.
In an iron-balance metabolic study in iron-overloaded adult thalassaemic patients, EXJADE at daily doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/ kg induced the mean net excretion of 0.119, 0.329 and 0.445 mg Fe/ kg body weight/ day, respectively.
EXJADE has been investigated in 411 adult (age ≥ 16 years) and 292 paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 16 years) with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions.
Of the paediatric patients 52 were aged 2 to 5 years.
The underlying conditions requiring transfusion included beta-thalassaemia, sickle cell disease and other congenital and acquired anaemias (myelodysplastic syndromes, Diamond- Blackfan syndrome, aplastic anaemia and other very rare anaemias).
Daily treatment at doses of 20 and 30 mg/ kg for one year in frequently transfused adult and paediatric patients with beta-thalassaemia led to reductions in indicators of total body iron; liver iron concentration was reduced by about -0.4 and -8.9 mg Fe/ g liver (biopsy dry weight (dw)) on average, respectively, and serum ferritin was reduced by about -36 and -926 µg/ l on average, respectively.
At these same doses the ratios of iron excretion: iron intake were 1.02 (indicating net iron balance) and 1.67 (indicating net iron removal), respectively.
EXJADE induced similar responses in iron- overloaded patients with other anaemias.
Daily doses of 10 mg/ kg for one year could maintain liver iron and serum ferritin levels and induce net iron balance in patients receiving infrequent transfusions or exchange transfusions.
Serum ferritin assessed by monthly monitoring reflected changes in liver iron concentration indicating that trends in serum ferritin can be used to monitor response to therapy.
Limited clinical data (29 patients with normal cardiac function at baseline) using MRI indicate that treatment with EXJADE 10-30 mg/ kg/ day for 1 year may also reduce levels of iron in the heart (on average, MRI T2* increased from 18.3 to 23.0 milliseconds).
The principal analysis of the pivotal comparative study in 586 patients suffering from beta- thalassaemia and transfusional iron overload did not demonstrate non-inferiority of EXJADE to deferoxamine in the analysis of the total patient population.
It appeared from a post-hoc analysis of this study that, in the subgroup of patients with liver iron concentration ≥ 7 mg Fe/ g dw treated with EXJADE (20 and 30 mg/ kg) or deferoxamine (35 to ≥ 50 mg/ kg), the non-inferiority criteria were achieved.
However, in patients with liver iron concentration < 7 mg Fe/ g dw treated with EXJADE (5 and 10 mg/ kg) or deferoxamine (20 to 35 mg/ kg), non-inferiority was not established due to imbalance in the dosing of the two chelators.
This imbalance occurred because patients on deferoxamine were allowed to remain on their pre-study dose even if it was higher than the protocol specified dose.
Fifty- six patients under the age of 6 years participated in this pivotal study, 28 of them receiving EXJADE.
20 It appeared from preclinical and clinical studies that EXJADE could be as active as deferoxamine when used in a dose ratio of 2:1 (i. e. a dose of EXJADE that is numerically half of the deferoxamine dose).
However, this dosing recommendation was not prospectively assessed in the clinical trials.
In addition, in patients with liver iron concentration ≥ 7 mg Fe/ g dw with various rare anaemias or sickle cell disease, EXJADE up to 20 and 30 mg/ kg produced a decrease in liver iron concentration and serum ferritin comparable to that obtained in patients with beta-thalassaemia.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption U
Deferasirox is absorbed following oral administration with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) of about 1.5 to 4 hours.
The absolute bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox from
B
B
EXJADE tablets is about 70% compared to an intravenous dose.
Total exposure (AUC) was approximately doubled when taken along with a high-fat breakfast (fat content > 50% of calories) and by about 50% when taken along with a standard breakfast.
The bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox was moderately (approx.
13– 25%) elevated when taken 30 minutes before meals with normal or high fat content.
Distribution U U
Deferasirox is highly (99%) protein bound to plasma proteins, almost exclusively serum albumin, and has a small volume of distribution of approximately 14 litres in adults.
Biotransformation U U
Glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion.
Deconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) is likely to occur.
Deferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3.
CYP450-catalysed (oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%).
No inhibition of deferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea was observed in vitro.
Elimination U U
Deferasirox and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the faeces (84% of the dose).
Renal excretion of deferasirox and its metabolites is minimal (8% of the dose).
The mean elimination half-life (t 1/ 2)
B
B
ranged from 8 to 16 hours.
The transporters MRP2 and MXR (BCRP) are involved in the biliary excretion of deferasirox.
Linearity / non-linearity U
The C max and AUC 0-24h of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose under steady-state
B B B
B
conditions.
Upon multiple dosing exposure increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3.
Characteristics in patients U
Paediatric patients The overall exposure of adolescents (12 to ≤ 17 years) and children (2 to < 12 years) to deferasirox after single and multiple doses was lower than that in adult patients.
In children younger than 6 years old exposure was about 50% lower than in adults.
Since dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical consequences.
Gender Females have a moderately lower apparent clearance (by 17.5%) for deferasirox compared to males.
Since dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical consequences.
Elderly patients The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in elderly patients (aged 65 or older).
21 Renal or hepatic impairment The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox were not influenced by liver transaminase levels up to 5 times the upper limit of the normal range.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for patients with iron overload, based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential.
The main findings were kidney toxicity and lens opacity (cataracts).
Similar findings were observed in neonatal and juvenile animals.
The kidney toxicity is considered mainly due to iron deprivation in animals that were not previously overloaded with iron.
Tests of genotoxicity in vitro were either negative (Ames test, chromosomal aberration test) or positive (V79 screen).
Deferasirox caused formation of micronuclei in vivo in the bone marrow, but not liver, of non-iron-loaded rats at lethal doses.
No such effects were observed in iron-preloaded rats.
Deferasirox was not carcinogenic when administered to rats in a 2-year study and transgenic p53+/ - heterozygous mice in a 6-month study.
The potential for toxicity to reproduction was assessed in rats and rabbits.
Deferasirox was not teratogenic, but caused increased frequency of skeletal variations and stillborn pups in rats at high doses that were severely toxic to the non-iron-overloaded mother.
Deferasirox did not cause other effects on fertility or reproduction.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
EXJADE is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥ 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older.
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups:
- in patients with other anaemias,
- in patients aged 2 to 5 years,
- in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood transfusions
(< 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with EXJADE should be initiated and maintained by physicians experienced in the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions.
It is recommended that treatment be started after the transfusion of approximately 20 units (about 100 ml/ kg) of packed red blood cells or when there is evidence from clinical monitoring that chronic iron overload is present (e. g. serum ferritin > 1,000 µg/ l).
Doses (in mg/ kg) must be calculated and rounded to the nearest whole tablet size.
The goals of iron chelation therapy are to remove the amount of iron administered in transfusions and, as required, to reduce the existing iron burden.

The recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE is 20 mg/ kg body weight.
An initial daily dose of 30 mg/ kg may be considered for patients who require reduction of elevated body iron levels and who are also receiving more than 14 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells (approximately > 4 units/ month for an adult).
24 An initial daily dose of 10 mg/ kg may be considered for patients who do not require reduction of body iron levels and who are also receiving less than 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells (approximately < 2 units/ month for an adult).
The patient’ s response must be monitored and a dose increase should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1).
For patients already well managed on treatment with deferoxamine, a starting dose of EXJADE that is numerically half that of the deferoxamine dose could be considered (e. g. a patient receiving 40 mg/ kg/ day of deferoxamine for 5 days per week (or equivalent) could be transferred to a starting daily dose of 20 mg/ kg/ day of EXJADE).
When this results in a daily dose less than 20 mg/ kg body weight, the patient’ s response must be monitored and a dose increase should be considered if sufficient efficacy is not obtained (see section 5.1).
Maintenance dose U
It is recommended that serum ferritin be monitored every month and that the dose of EXJADE be adjusted, if necessary, every 3 to 6 months based on the trends in serum ferritin.
Dose adjustments may be made in steps of 5 to 10 mg/ kg and are to be tailored to the individual patient’ s response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of iron burden).
Doses above 30 mg/ kg are not recommended because there is only limited experience with doses above this level.
If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/ l, an interruption of treatment should be considered (see section 4.4).
Preparation U
EXJADE must be taken once daily on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before food, preferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).
The tablets are dispersed by stirring in a glass of water or orange or apple juice (100 to 200 ml) until a fine suspension is obtained.
After the suspension has been swallowed, any residue must be resuspended in a small volume of water or juice and swallowed.
The tablets must not be chewed or swallowed whole (see also section 6.2).
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) U
The dosing recommendations for elderly patients are the same as described above.
Paediatric patients (2 to 17 years of age) U
The dosing recommendations for paediatric patients are the same as for adult patients.
Changes in weight of paediatric patients over time must be taken into account when calculating the dose.
In children aged between 2 and 5 years, exposure is lower than in adults (see section 5.2).
This age group may therefore require higher doses than are necessary in adults.
However, the initial dose should be the same as in adults, followed by individual titration.
Patients with renal impairment U
EXJADE has not been studied in patients with renal impairment and is contraindicated in patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Patients with hepatic impairment U
EXJADE has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment and must be used with caution in such patients.
The initial dosing recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment are the same as described above.
Hepatic function in all patients should be monitored before treatment then every month (see section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Combination with other iron chelator therapies as the safety of such combinations has not been established (see section 4.5).
Patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min.
25 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Renal function:
U
EXJADE has been studied only in patients with baseline serum creatinine within the age-appropriate normal range.
During clinical trials, increases in serum creatinine of > 33% on ≥ 2 consecutive occasions, sometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients.
These were dose- dependent.
About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below the 33% level without dose adjustment.
In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not always respond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption.
Cases of acute renal failure have been reported following post-marketing use of EXJADE (see section 4.8).
The causes of the rises in serum creatinine have not been elucidated.
Particular attention should therefore be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are receiving high doses of EXJADE and/ or low rates of transfusion (< 7 ml/ kg/ month of packed red blood cells or < 2 units/ month for an adult).
It is recommended that serum creatinine be assessed in duplicate before initiating therapy.
Serum creatinine, creatinine clearance (estimated with the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD formula in adults and with the Schwartz formula in children) and/ or plasma cystatin C levels should be monitored weekly in the first month after initiation or modification of therapy with EXJADE, and monthly thereafter.
Patients with pre-existing renal conditions and patients who are receiving medicinal products that depress renal function may be more at risk of complications.
Care should be taken to maintain adequate hydration in patients who develop diarrhoea or vomiting.
For adult patients, the daily dose may be reduced by 10 mg/ kg if a rise in serum creatinine by > 33% above the average of the pre-treatment measurements and estimated creatinine clearance decreases below the lower limit of the normal range (< 90 ml/ min) are seen at two consecutive visits, and cannot be attributed to other causes (see section 4.2).
For paediatric patients, the dose may be reduced by 10 mg/ kg if estimated creatinine clearance decreases below the lower limit of the normal range (< 90 ml/ min) and/ or serum creatinine levels rise above the age-appropriate upper limit of normal at two consecutive visits.
After a dose reduction, for adult and paediatric patients, treatment should be interrupted if a rise in serum creatinine > 33% above the average of the pre-treatment measurements is observed and/ or the calculated creatinine clearance falls below the lower limit of the normal range.
Treatment may be reinitiated depending on the individual clinical circumstances.
Particular attention should also be paid to monitoring of serum creatinine in patients who are concomitantly receiving medicinal products that depress renal function.
Tests for proteinuria should be performed monthly.
As needed, additional markers of renal tubular function (e. g. glycosuria in non-diabetics and low levels of serum potassium, phosphate, magnesium or urate, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria) may also be monitored.
Dose reduction or interruption may be considered if there are abnormalities in levels of tubular markers and/ or if clinically indicated.
If, despite dose reduction and interruption, the serum creatinine remains significantly elevated and there is also persistent abnormality in another marker of renal function (e. g. proteinuria, Fanconi’ s Syndrome), the patient should be referred to a renal specialist, and further specialised investigations (such as renal biopsy) may be considered.
26 Hepatic function:
U U
Liver function test elevations have been observed in patients treated with EXJADE.
Postmarketing cases of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with EXJADE.
Most reports of hepatic failure involved patients with significant morbidities including pre-existing liver cirrhosis.
However, the role of EXJADE as a contributing or aggravating factor cannot be excluded (see section 4.8).
It is recommended that serum transaminases, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase be checked before the initiation of treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month and monthly thereafter.
If there is a persistent and progressive increase in serum transaminase levels that cannot be attributed to other causes, EXJADE should be interrupted.
Once the cause of the liver function test abnormalities has been clarified or after return to normal levels, cautious re-initiation of treatment at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation may be considered.
EXJADE is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it has not been studied in such patients.
Treatment has been initiated only in patients with baseline liver transaminase levels up to 5 times the upper limit of the normal range (see section 5.2).
Upper gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children and adolescents, receiving EXJADE.
Multiple ulcers have been observed in some patients (see section 4.8).
Physicians and patients should remain alert for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage during EXJADE therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious gastrointestinal adverse event is suspected.
Caution should be exercised in patients who are taking EXJADE in combination with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids, or oral bisphosphonates and in patients receiving anticoagulants (see section 4.5).
Skin rashes may appear during EXJADE treatment.
The rashes resolve spontaneously in most cases.
When interruption of treatment may be necessary, treatment may be reintroduced after resolution of the rash, at a lower dose followed by gradual dose escalation.
In severe cases this reintroduction could be conducted in combination with a short period of oral steroid administration.
Cases of serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported in patients receiving EXJADE, with the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment (see section 4.8).
If such reactions occur, EXJADE should be discontinued and appropriate medical intervention instituted.
Auditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) disturbances have been reported (see section 4.8).
Auditory and ophthalmic testing (including fundoscopy) is recommended before the start of treatment and at regular intervals thereafter (every 12 months).
If disturbances are noted during the treatment, dose reduction or interruption may be considered.
There have been post-marketing reports of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia, or aggravation of these cytopenias in patients treated with EXJADE.
Most of these patients had pre- existing haematological disorders that are frequently associated with bone marrow failure.
However, a contributory or aggravating role cannot be excluded.
Interruption of treatment should be considered in patients who develop unexplained cytopenia.
Monthly monitoring of serum ferritin is recommended in order to assess the patient’ s response to therapy (see section 4.2).
If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 µg/ l, an interruption of treatment should be considered.
27 The results of the tests for serum creatinine, serum ferritin and serum transaminases should be recorded and regularly assessed for trends.
The results should also be noted in the provided patient’ s booklet.
In the 1-year clinical studies growth and sexual development of paediatric patients treated with EXJADE were not affected.
However, as a general precautionary measure in the management of paediatric patients with transfusional iron overload, body weight, height and sexual development should be monitored at regular intervals (every 12 months).
Cardiac dysfunction is a known complication of severe iron overload.
Cardiac function should be monitored in patients with severe iron overload during long-term treatment with EXJADE.
The tablets contain lactose (1.1 mg lactose for each mg of deferasirox).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or severe lactase deficiency should not take this medicine.
The concomitant use of deferasirox with aluminium-containing antacid preparations is not recommended.
Caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with strong UDP- glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) inducers, or CYP2C8 substrates (see section 4.5).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The concomitant administration of EXJADE and aluminium-containing antacid preparations has not been formally studied.
Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminium than for iron, it is not recommended to take EXJADE tablets with aluminium-containing antacid preparations (see section 4.4).
The bioavailability of deferasirox was increased to a variable extent when taken along with food.
EXJADE must therefore be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before food, preferably at the same time each day (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Deferasirox metabolism depends on UGT enzymes.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of EXJADE (single dose of 30 mg/ kg) and the potent UGT inducer, rifampicin, (repeated dose of 600 mg/ day) resulted in a decrease of deferasirox exposure by 44% (90% CI:
37% - 51%).
Therefore, the concomitant use of EXJADE with potent UGT inducers (e. g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) may result in a decrease in EXJADE efficacy (see section 4.4).
The patient ’ s serum ferritin should be monitored during and after the combination, and the dose of EXJADE adjusted if necessary.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of EXJADE and midazolam (a CYP3A4 probe substrate) resulted in a decrease of midazolam exposure by 17% (90% CI:
8% - 26%).
In the clinical setting, this effect may be more pronounced.
Therefore, due to a possible decrease in efficacy, caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined with substances metabolised through CYP3A4 (e. g. ciclosporin, simvastatin, hormonal contraceptive agents, bepridil, ergotamine).
The safety of EXJADE in combination with other iron chelators has not been established.
Therefore, it must not be combined with other iron chelator therapies (see section 4.3).
No interaction was observed between EXJADE and digoxin in healthy adult volunteers.
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant administration of deferasirox as a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor (30 mg/ kg/ daily), with repaglinide, a CYP2C8 substrate, given as a single dose of 0.5 mg, increased repaglinide AUC and C max about 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-2.63]) and 1.6-fold (90% CI
B
B
[1.42-1.84]), respectively.
Since the interaction has not been established with dosages higher than 0.5 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of deferasirox with repaglinide should be avoided.
If the combination appears necessary, careful clinical and blood glucose monitoring should be performed
28 (see section 4.4).
An interaction between deferasirox and other CYP2C8 substrates like paclitaxel cannot be excluded (see section 4.4).
The concomitant administration of EXJADE and vitamin C has not been formally studied.
Doses of vitamin C up to 200 mg per day have not been associated with adverse consequences.
The concomitant administration of EXJADE with substances that have known ulcerogenic potential, such as NSAIDs (including acetylsalicylic acid at high dosage), corticosteroids or oral bisphosphonates may increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity (see section 4.4).
The concomitant administration of EXJADE with anticoagulants may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
Close clinical monitoring is required when deferasirox is combined with these substances.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy U
No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for deferasirox.
Studies in animals have shown some reproductive toxicity at maternally toxic doses (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
As a precaution, it is recommended that EXJADE not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Lactation U
In animal studies, deferasirox was found to be rapidly and extensively secreted into maternal milk.
No effect on the offspring was noted.
It is not known if deferasirox is secreted into human milk.
Breast- feeding while taking EXJADE is not recommended.
Fertility U
No fertility data is available for humans.
In animals, no adverse effects on male or female fertility were found (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects of EXJADE on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Patients experiencing the uncommon adverse reaction of dizziness should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent reactions reported during chronic treatment with EXJADE in adult and paediatric patients include gastrointestinal disturbances in about 26% of patients (mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or abdominal pain) and skin rash in about 7% of patients.
Diarrhoea is reported more commonly in paediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years than in older patients.
These reactions are dose- dependent, mostly mild to moderate, generally transient and mostly resolve even if treatment is continued.
During clinical trials, increases in serum creatinine of > 33% on ≥ 2 consecutive occasions, sometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients.
These were dose- dependent.
About two-thirds of the patients showing serum creatinine increase returned below the 33% level without dose adjustment.
In the remaining third the serum creatinine increase did not always respond to a dose reduction or a dose interruption.
Indeed, in some cases, only a stabilisation of the serum creatinine values has been observed after dose reduction (see section 4.4).
29 Gallstones and related biliary disorders were reported in about 2% of patients.
Elevations of liver transaminases were reported as an adverse drug reaction in 2% of patients.
Elevations of transaminases greater than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range, suggestive of hepatitis, were uncommon (0.3%).
During postmarketing experience, hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, has been reported with EXJADE, especially in patients with pre-existing liver cirrhosis (see section 4.4).
As with other iron chelator treatment, high-frequency hearing loss and lenticular opacities (early cataracts) have been uncommonly observed in patients treated with EXJADE (see section 4.4).
Adverse reactions are ranked below using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000); not known (cannot be estimated form the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

30 4.9 Overdose
Cases of overdose (2-3 times the prescribed dose for several weeks) have been reported.
In one case, this resulted in subclinical hepatitis which resolved after a dose interruption.
Single doses of 80 mg/ kg in iron-overloaded thalassaemic patients caused mild nausea and diarrhoea.
Acute signs of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, headache and diarrhoea.
Overdose may be treated by induction of emesis or by gastric lavage, and by symptomatic treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Iron chelating agent, ATC code:
V03AC03
Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is highly selective for iron (III).
It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio.
Deferasirox promotes excretion of iron, primarily in the faeces.
Deferasirox has low affinity for zinc and copper, and does not cause constant low serum levels of these metals.
In an iron-balance metabolic study in iron-overloaded adult thalassaemic patients, EXJADE at daily doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/ kg induced the mean net excretion of 0.119, 0.329 and 0.445 mg Fe/ kg body weight/ day, respectively.
EXJADE has been investigated in 411 adult (age ≥ 16 years) and 292 paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 16 years) with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions.
Of the paediatric patients 52 were aged 2 to 5 years.
The underlying conditions requiring transfusion included beta-thalassaemia, sickle cell disease and other congenital and acquired anaemias (myelodysplastic syndromes, Diamond- Blackfan syndrome, aplastic anaemia and other very rare anaemias).
Daily treatment at doses of 20 and 30 mg/ kg for one year in frequently transfused adult and paediatric patients with beta-thalassaemia led to reductions in indicators of total body iron; liver iron concentration was reduced by about -0.4 and -8.9 mg Fe/ g liver (biopsy dry weight (dw)) on average, respectively, and serum ferritin was reduced by about -36 and -926 µg/ l on average, respectively.
At these same doses the ratios of iron excretion: iron intake were 1.02 (indicating net iron balance) and 1.67 (indicating net iron removal), respectively.
EXJADE induced similar responses in iron- overloaded patients with other anaemias.
Daily doses of 10 mg/ kg for one year could maintain liver iron and serum ferritin levels and induce net iron balance in patients receiving infrequent transfusions or exchange transfusions.
Serum ferritin assessed by monthly monitoring reflected changes in liver iron concentration indicating that trends in serum ferritin can be used to monitor response to therapy.
Limited clinical data (29 patients with normal cardiac function at baseline) using MRI indicate that treatment with EXJADE 10-30 mg/ kg/ day for 1 year may also reduce levels of iron in the heart (on average, MRI T2* increased from 18.3 to 23.0 milliseconds).
The principal analysis of the pivotal comparative study in 586 patients suffering from beta- thalassaemia and transfusional iron overload did not demonstrate non-inferiority of EXJADE to deferoxamine in the analysis of the total patient population.
It appeared from a post-hoc analysis of this study that, in the subgroup of patients with liver iron concentration ≥ 7 mg Fe/ g dw treated with EXJADE (20 and 30 mg/ kg) or deferoxamine (35 to ≥ 50 mg/ kg), the non-inferiority criteria were achieved.
However, in patients with liver iron concentration < 7 mg Fe/ g dw treated with EXJADE (5 and 10 mg/ kg) or deferoxamine (20 to 35 mg/ kg), non-inferiority was not established due to imbalance in the dosing of the two chelators.
This imbalance occurred because patients on deferoxamine were allowed to remain on their pre-study dose even if it was higher than the protocol specified dose.
Fifty- six patients under the age of 6 years participated in this pivotal study, 28 of them receiving EXJADE.
31 It appeared from preclinical and clinical studies that EXJADE could be as active as deferoxamine when used in a dose ratio of 2:1 (i. e. a dose of EXJADE that is numerically half of the deferoxamine dose).
However, this dosing recommendation was not prospectively assessed in the clinical trials.
In addition, in patients with liver iron concentration ≥ 7 mg Fe/ g dw with various rare anaemias or sickle cell disease, EXJADE up to 20 and 30 mg/ kg produced a decrease in liver iron concentration and serum ferritin comparable to that obtained in patients with beta-thalassaemia.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption U
Deferasirox is absorbed following oral administration with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) of about 1.5 to 4 hours.
The absolute bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox from
B
B
EXJADE tablets is about 70% compared to an intravenous dose.
Total exposure (AUC) was approximately doubled when taken along with a high-fat breakfast (fat content > 50% of calories) and by about 50% when taken along with a standard breakfast.
The bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox was moderately (approx.
13– 25%) elevated when taken 30 minutes before meals with normal or high fat content.
Distribution U U
Deferasirox is highly (99%) protein bound to plasma proteins, almost exclusively serum albumin, and has a small volume of distribution of approximately 14 litres in adults.
Biotransformation U U
Glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion.
Deconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) is likely to occur.
Deferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3.
CYP450-catalysed (oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%).
No inhibition of deferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea was observed in vitro.
Elimination U U
Deferasirox and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the faeces (84% of the dose).
Renal excretion of deferasirox and its metabolites is minimal (8% of the dose).
The mean elimination half-life (t 1/ 2)
B
B
ranged from 8 to 16 hours.
The transporters MRP2 and MXR (BCRP) are involved in the biliary excretion of deferasirox.
Linearity / non-linearity U
The C max and AUC 0-24h of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose under steady-state
B B B
B
conditions.
Upon multiple dosing exposure increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3.
Characteristics in patients U
Paediatric patients The overall exposure of adolescents (12 to ≤ 17 years) and children (2 to < 12 years) to deferasirox after single and multiple doses was lower than that in adult patients.
In children younger than 6 years old exposure was about 50% lower than in adults.
Since dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical consequences.
Gender Females have a moderately lower apparent clearance (by 17.5%) for deferasirox compared to males.
Since dosing is individually adjusted according to response this is not expected to have clinical consequences.
Elderly patients The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in elderly patients (aged 65 or older).
32 Renal or hepatic impairment The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox have not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox were not influenced by liver transaminase levels up to 5 times the upper limit of the normal range.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for patients with iron overload, based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenic potential.
The main findings were kidney toxicity and lens opacity (cataracts).
Similar findings were observed in neonatal and juvenile animals.
The kidney toxicity is considered mainly due to iron deprivation in animals that were not previously overloaded with iron.
Tests of genotoxicity in vitro were either negative (Ames test, chromosomal aberration test) or positive (V79 screen).
Deferasirox caused formation of micronuclei in vivo in the bone marrow, but not liver, of non-iron-loaded rats at lethal doses.
No such effects were observed in iron-preloaded rats.
Deferasirox was not carcinogenic when administered to rats in a 2-year study and transgenic p53+/ - heterozygous mice in a 6-month study.
The potential for toxicity to reproduction was assessed in rats and rabbits.
Deferasirox was not teratogenic, but caused increased frequency of skeletal variations and stillborn pups in rats at high doses that were severely toxic to the non-iron-overloaded mother.
Deferasirox did not cause other effects on fertility or reproduction.

Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I:
Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.2).
• CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
The MAH shall set up a surveillance programme to collect information on the demographics of patients prescribed Exjade, any adverse reactions and reasons for discontinuation of Exjade.
The formal protocols for the sentinel monitoring surveillance should be reviewed by the CHMP.
The MAH must ensure that, at launch, all physicians who are expected to prescribe Exjade are provided with a physician information pack containing the following:
Product information Physician information about Exjade (brochure and pocket card) Patient information pack
The physician information about Exjade should contain the following key elements:
•
The need to monitor serum ferritin monthly
•
That Exjade causes rises in serum creatinine in some patients o The need to monitor serum creatinine • On two occasions prior to initiation of treatment • Every week during the first month of initiation of treatment or after therapy modification • Monthly thereafter
o
The need to reduce by 10 mg/kg the dose if serum creatinine rises: • Adults: > 33% above baseline and creatinine clearance < LLN (90 ml/min) • Paediatrics: either > ULN or creatinine clearance falls to < LLN at two consecutive visits.
o
The need t o interrupt treatment after a dose reduction if serum creatinine rises: • Adults and Paediatrics: remain > 33% above baseline or creatinine clearance < LLN (90 ml/min)
36
o
The need to consider renal biopsy: • When serum creatinine is elevated and if another abnormality has been detected (eg. proteinuria, signs of Fanconi’s Syndrome).
• The importance of measuring creatinine clearance • Brief overview of methods of measuring creatinine clearance • That rises in serum transaminases occur in patients treated with Exjade o The need for liver function tests prior to prescription, then at monthly intervals or more often if clinically indicated o Not to prescribe to patients with pre-existing severe hepatic disease o The need to interrupt treatment if persistent and progressive increase in liver enzyme were noted. • The need for annual auditory and ophthalmic testing
• The need for a guidance table highlighting pre-treatment measurements of serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, hepatic enzymes, ferritin, such as:
Before initiating treatment
Serum creatinine at Day - X Serum creatinine at Day - Y
Value 1 Value 2
X and Y are the days (to be determined) when pre-treatment measurements should be performed.

1.
WHAT EXJADE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
What EXJADE is EXJADE contains an active substance called deferasirox.
It is an iron chelator which is a medicine used to remove the excess iron from the body (also called iron overload).
What EXJADE is used for EXJADE is used to treat iron overload caused by blood transfusions.
Repeated blood transfusions may be necessary in patients with various types of anaemia (for example thalassaemia, sickle cell disease or myelodysplastic syndromes).
However, repeated blood transfusions can cause a build-up of excess iron.
This is because blood contains iron and your body does not have a natural way to remove the excess iron you get with your blood transfusions.
Over time, the excess iron can damage important organs such as the liver and heart.
Medicines called iron chelators are used to remove the excess iron and reduce the risk of it causing organ damage.
EXJADE is used to treat chronic iron overload caused by frequent blood transfusions in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older.
EXJADE is also used when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload caused by infrequent blood transfusions, in patients with other types of anaemias, and in children aged 2 to 5 years.
How EXJADE works EXJADE traps and removes excess iron which is then excreted mainly in the stools.
Monitoring your EXJADE treatment You will have regular blood and urine tests during treatment.
These will monitor the amount of iron in your body (blood level of ferritin) to see how well EXJADE is working.
The tests will also monitor your kidney function (blood level of creatinine, presence of protein in the urine) and liver function (blood level of transaminases).
Your doctor will take these tests into consideration when deciding on the dose of EXJADE most suitable for you.
51 You will get a booklet from your doctor which will help you to track your response to EXJADE.
Your doctor will write your blood tests in this booklet at each visit.
Keep the booklet safe and bring it with you each time you visit your doctor.
Your eyesight and hearing will be tested each year during treatment as a precautionary measure.
If you have any questions about how EXJADE works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor.
2.

Taking other medicines Antacids (medicines used to treat heartburn) containing aluminium should not be taken at the same time of day as EXJADE.
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
This includes in particular:
- ciclosporin (used to prevent the body rejecting a transplanted organ or for other conditions, such
as rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis),
- simvastatin (used to lower cholesterol),
- certain painkillers or anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, corticosteroids),
- oral bisphosphonates (used to treat osteoporosis),
