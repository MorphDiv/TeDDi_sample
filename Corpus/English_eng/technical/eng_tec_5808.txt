All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD / NetBSD / OpenBSD / MacOS;)
& Windows; XP and Vista
In order to handle archives, checksums and other utilities they must be configured in our configuration tool. When running & krusader; for the first time the available utilities will be autodetected, and a report will be shown in the first lanch wizard. Afterwards additional utilities can be added/ removed/ changed.
A package of popular (un)packers, & krusader; itself and add-ons can be found on the krusader; downloadpage.
For more requirements, see below. Have a look at the FAQ section as well.
Obtaining & krusader;
The latest information about & krusader; can be found on the Krusader website.
& krusader; Downloads
It is recommended to use the & krusader; package that is provided by your distribution. Distrowatch. com is a great resource to check the availability. If your distribution does not offer & krusader;, please contact the creators of your distribution and ask them to provide a & krusader; package
The latest version, as well as the older versions, can be found on the krusader; downloadpage and on the Sourceforge mirrors. It contains the source tarballs, RPM and DEB packages to whatever distro the & krusader; -Krew is using and packages build by & krusader; users and third parties.
Distributions who provide & krusader;:
& SuSE;
Fedora via # yum install krusader will do the job, thanks to Marcin Garski. & RedHat; RPM packages can usually found on the krusader; downloadpage or at dag. wieers. com and Dries Verachtert RPM Repository.
Debian, on our krusader; downloadpage you might find more recent DEB packages. Note: usually Debian packages work also on distributions that are "based on Debian", and some of these provide their own (incompatible) packages. Ubuntu / Kubuntu, Linspire / Freespire, Knoppix 4. x DVD, Kanotix, etc.
Mandriva via the contrib repository # urpmi krusader will do the job, Gentoo, Yoper.
Arch Linux, Frugalware Linux, PCLinuxOS, altlinux.
FreeBSD, the port is maintained by Heiner Eichmann.
NetBSD, Lunar Linux, Ark Linux, OpenLX, Source Mage, CCux Linux, ROCK Linux.
More distributions can be found with Distrowatch. com.
Use the installation tools included in your distro to install the & krusader; package. You might need an internet connection if & krusader; is not included on the & CD; or DVD. There are probably other distributions which include & krusader;. If you know of one, please send feedback so that we can include it on the distrolist.
Others
Slackware tgz binaries can usually be found on the krusader; downloadpage. You can also use Portpkg that contains a krusader; SlackBuild, # portpkg krusader will do the job.
There is a MacOS; -X port.
There is a Windows; port.
Search engines You can also find packages on & Linux; software archives such as freshmeat. net or KDE-APPS. org. If you can not find a package for your distribution, we recommend searching for it with rpmfind, rpmpbone or rpmseek. If you enjoy using & krusader;, we would appreciate it if you went to one of these sites and rated it.
If you still can not find a package, follow the installation procedure on how to compile & krusader; from source. This very thorough HowTo describes the process in such detail that even newcomers should not have any problems.
Version Scheme
A new version scheme has been used since & krusader; -1.60.0 First digit - the major version Second digit(s) - percentage of features completed for this major version Third digit(s) - bugfixes. In essence, releasing & krusader; -1.60.0 means that we believe that & krusader; is about 60% done with all the features we had scheduled for the 1. x. x series. Series 2. x. x will be & kde; 4. x releases. Hopefully, it is easy to understand.
Stable Version
krusader-x. xx. tar. gz
& krusader; is released under the GNU; General Public License (GPL). This means that THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, even when it is marked as a stable release.
Development Version (beta release)
krusader-x. xx-betax. tar. gz
Before every stable release we release at least one development version in order to hunt down the bugs.
These releases are beta releases and will probably contain some bugs.
If you are using a development or SVN version, it is possible that the latest new features are not yet in the "The Krusader Handbook". Please read the Changelog file online or in the & krusader; sources to find out more about the new features. For a brief description, please read the SVNNEWS file online or in the & krusader; sources. User feedback and Bug reports are always welcome!
The beta release has 3 goals:
Apply a feature-freeze until the stable is released, only bugs will be fixed. New features have to wait until the stable is released.
Obtain feedback from & krusader; users so that we can fix the bugs.
Give translators time to update the translations for the coming stable release.
Subversion
Subversion is used for our sourcecode repository. It is also possible to Browse the Subversion Repository.
Currently, there are four module options:
krusader_kde2: the & kde; 2 branch, stable but it is basically v1.01 and there are no planned changes
krusader_kde3: the & kde; 3 branch, stable but it is basically v1.90.0 and there are no planned changes
krusader_kde4: the & kde; 4 branch that we currently use
trunk: the & kde; 4 the development version
To check out the latest development & krusader; 2. x for & kde; 4 from SVN:
$svn co svn: / /anonsvn. kde. org/ home/ kde/ trunk/ extragear/ utils/ krusader/
Older Releases
If you are looking for older releases we recommend the Sourceforge mirrors, available from our project page.
Krusader installation instructions on KDE4. x
Please read the INSTALL file of the Krusader sources, it contains all latest installation instructions.
From version & krusader; -2.0.0 and higher is & kde; -4 only.
"krusader_kde4. tar. gz" is the supposed name of the krusader tarball (it will be probably a different one;)
You can download the latest available krusader-2. x from SVN.

Installing on Linux and BSD platforms
-DQT_INCLUDES=/ usr/ share/ qt4/ include is the location of the & Qt; 4 includes
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/ usr/ is the location where Krusader will be installed with the make command.
An other example is: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PRFIX=/ opt/ krusader to install the compiled Krusader in an other directory to not overwrite the Krusader version installed by your package manager.
$tar -xzvf krusader_kde4. tar. gz $cd krusader_kde4 $cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/ usr/ -DQT_INCLUDES=/ usr/ share/ qt4/ include $make $sudo make install
Uninstall
$su -c "make uninstall"
Installing on the & MacOS; -X platform
With & kde; -4 Krusader runs natively on & MacOS; -X, using it's Aqua user interface (No more X11 needed!).
With the help of macports. org, & krusader; is ported to & MacOS; -X, the port is maintained by Jonas Bauml; hr. A portfile is provided.
$sudo port install krusader
Installing on the & Windows; platform
Tested on & Windows; XP, not yet tested on & Windows; Vista but it should work.
With Krusader-2.0.0 it's the first time that Krusader compiles on & Windows;, some work needs to be done to make Krusader more usable on the & Windows; platform. All feedback is welcome!
Krusader can be compiled and installed on & Windows; with the Win-KDE installer. See also windows. kde. org for more information.
