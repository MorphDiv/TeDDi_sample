(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a positive mSQL query identifier to the query result, or FALSE on error.
msql() selects a database and executes a query on it.
If the optional link identifier isn' t specified, the function will try to find an open link to the mSQL server and if no such link is found it'll try to create one as if msql_connect() was called with no arguments (see msql_connect()).
