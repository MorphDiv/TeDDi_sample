Introduction

Blackjack Basics
Blackjack Terminology
Here are a few important terms that are used in the game.
A hand whose first two cards total 21; an instant win worth 150% of your wager
Bust
When the value of a hand exceeds 21; a losing hand
Double down
To double the initial wager and receive exactly one more card
Hit
To request another card to be added to the hand
Insurance
A side wager of 50% of the original wager that the dealer has a natural 21 (aka blackjack) that is offered when the dealer's face up card is an ace. If the dealer has a natural 21 then the player is paid double.
Push
When the value of the player hand and the dealer hand are equal, the original wager is returned to the player
Split
When a hand starts with two cards of the same value (or rank) it may be split to form two independent hands
Stand
To stop adding cards to a hand
Surrender
To give up half your wager to not complete the hand
Card Values
An Ace can count as either 1 or 11.
The cards 2 through 9 are valued as indicated.
The 10, Jack, Queen, and King are all valued at 10.
In blackjack, each card is assigned a value.
The value of a hand is the sum of the values of each card in the hand.
Dealer Rules
Dealer stands on all 17s
The dealer must continue to draw cards (hit) until the hand total is at least 17.
Dealer hits soft 17
The dealer must continue to draw cards (hit) until the hand total is at least 17, except when the dealer has a soft total of 17 he must take another card. A soft total is one where an Ace card is counted as an 11.
The dealer must play his hand according to very specific rules. There are two basic rule variations that determine what hand total the dealer must draw to.

This menu contains:

The playing area (or table), located below the
Dealer position
This is where the dealer hand will be placed. It is located at the top of the playing area. On a clear table it will appear as a white outlined region.
Player positions
This is where the player's hands will be placed. Initially, there will be only one player position. More will be created if the player splits a hand. On a clear table they will appear as white outlines below the dealer position.
Player wager stack
The wager stack represents the initial wager on each hand. It consists of a stack of chips located directly to the left of each player position.
Player chips
The player's chips represent an infinite stack of chips for each of the chip values 100, 25, 5, and 1. These chips are used to modify the wager.
Usage
To Set the Wager
Double click on the player chip, located along the lower edge of the playing area, that you wish to add to your wager.
Or, drag the desired chip onto your wager stack, located next to your hand.
To increase the wager for the hand:
To Deal a New Hand
A new hand can be dealt when the table is clear or when play has finished on the current hands.
To deal a new hand on a clear table, click in the white outlines that indicate the dealer or player positions.
To deal a new hand after play has finished on the current hands, click once on any of the cards on the table.
To Add a Card to a Hand (Hit)
You may add cards to a hand until the hand total is 21 or over.
To add a card to a player's hand, click once on any card in the hand.
To Stop Taking Cards (Stand)
You may stop taking cards at any time after the first two cards have been dealt.
To stop adding cards to a hand, click once on any other hand. For example, when there is only one player position (ie. you have not split a pair), click on the dealer's hand to stand. When you have split a pair, you may stand on the first player hand by clicking on the second player hand, or the dealer hand.
To Double Down
To double down, double click on any of the player chips after the first two cards have been dealt.
To Split Pairs
To split a pair, drag the top card of the hand off the player position and drop on any empty space on the table.
