Features
DHT is a trackerless protocol to find peers sharing the same torrents as you do.
Use DHT to get additional peers
UDP port for DHT communications:
Whether or not to use µTorrent compatible peer exchange.
Use peer exchange
Enable or disable the use of webseeds when they are present in a torrent.
Use webseeds
Encryption
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Protocol encryption is useful when your ISP is slowing down bittorrent connections. The encryption will prevent your bittorrent traffic to be flagged as bittorrent traffic, and so the ISP will not slow it down.
Use protocol encryption
Not all clients support encryption, and some people have encryption disabled. If you want to connect to those peers, you need to have this option enabled.
Allow unencrypted connections
Tracker
Instead of allowing the tracker to determine your IP address, tell the tracker which IP address to use. Use this when you are behind a proxy.
Send the tracker a custom IP address or hostname
Custom IP address or hostname:
Custom IP address or hostname to send to the tracker. Hostnames will be resolved at runtime and the resolved IP address will be sent to the tracker.
Data Checking
During uploading when a chunk is loaded into memory automatically recheck this chunk, to see if it still is OK.
Recheck chunks during uploading
Because rechecking big chunks can take a lot of time, the recheck can be disabled when the chunks are bigger then a certain size.
Do not recheck when chunks are bigger than
The maximum size a chunk can be for rechecking during uploading.
KiB
Automatically do a full data check when we find to many corrupted chunks.
Do a full data check after
The number of corrupted chunks before a full data check is done
When a torrent has finished downloading, do a full data check on the torrent.

When enabled, the queue manager will be totally disabled, allowing you to fully control all torrents manually.

When the free diskspace drops below this value, stop all torrents downloading.

p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} With this enabled, the queue manager will decrease the priority of a torrent which has been stalled for too long. This will allow the queue manager to run other torrents, when a torrent is doing nothing.
Decrease priority of torrents which are stalled for too long
Stalled timer:

Seeding
When a download is finished, continue seeding it. If this is disabled, the torrent will be stopped.
Keep seeding after download is finished
The number of upload slots, this determines the number of peers you can upload to simultaneously for one torrent.
Default maximum share ratio:
Default maximum seed time:
The maximum seed time in hours. Once you reach this time, the torrent will be stopped. This is only applied to newly opened torrents, existing torrents will not be affected by changing this.

Whether or not diskspace should be reserved before starting to download a torrent.
