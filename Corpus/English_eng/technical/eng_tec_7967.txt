The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

WHAT KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
The vial with powder for solution for injection nominally contains 250 IU octocog alfa (IU equals International Units).
After reconstitution with the appropriate volume of solvent (water for injections), each vial contains octocog alfa 100 IU/ ml.
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII (ATC-Code B02B D02).
KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is used for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
Each pack of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU contains a vial with Bio-Set transfer device and a pre-filled syringe with a separate plunger rod, as well as a venipuncture set, two alcohol swabs, two dry swabs and two plasters.
The vial contains a dry white to slightly yellow powder or cake.
The pre-filled syringe contains water for injections to be used to reconstitute the contents of the vial.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU
Do not use KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to octocog alfa, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU.
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Take special care with KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU as there is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction).
If you experience tightness in the chest, feeling dizzy, feeling sick or faint, or experience dizziness on standing, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU.
If this occurs, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.
172 Your doctor may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate factor VIII levels.
If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU, consult your doctor immediately.
You may have developed factor VIII inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this.
Factor VIII inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which block the factor VIII you are using.
This makes factor VIII less effective in controlling bleeding.
If you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back.
Using other medicines Interactions with other medicines are not known.
However, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding consult your doctor before using this product.
Driving and using machines:
No effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been observed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU This medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
3.
HOW TO USE KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU
KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is intended for intravenous administration only and must be administered immediately after reconstitution.
Aseptic conditions (meaning clean and germ free) are required during reconstitution and administration.
Use only the medical devices (powder vial with Bio-Set device, pre- filled syringe containing solvent and venipuncture set) for reconstitution and administration provided with each package of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU.
KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU must not be mixed with other infusion solutions.
Follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the instructions below as a guide:
1.
Wash hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
Ensure you prepare the solution on a clean and dry surface.
173 2.
Warm the unopened powder vial and the solvent syringe in your hands to approximately body temperature (do not exceed 37 °C).
Wipe any observable moisture from the vial.
3.
Remove the cap from the powder vial by gently moving it from side to side several times, whilst at the same time pulling upwards.
Remove the stopper attached to the white cap from the syringe (A).
4.
Gently screw the syringe on to the powder vial (B).
5.
Place the vial on a rigid, non-slip surface and hold it firmly with one hand.
Then, strongly press down the fingerplate near the syringe tip using your thumb and index finger (C) until the finger plate meets the top edge of the Bio-Set.
This indicates that the system is activated (D).
6.
Connect the plunger rod to the syringe by screwing it into the rubber stopper (E).
7.
Inject the solvent by slowly pushing the syringe’ s plunger down (F).
8.
Dissolve the powder by gently swirling the vial.
Do not shake the vial!
Ensure that the powder is completely dissolved before use.
Do not use solutions that contain visible particles or that are cloudy (G).
9.
Invert vial/ syringe and transfer the solution into syringe by drawing the plunger out slowly and smoothly (H).
Ensure that the entire contents of the vial are drawn into the syringe.
10.
If you need more than one dose, reconstitute the desired amount of product repeating steps 2. - 9.
Use separate syringes!
11.
Apply a tourniquet.
Determine the point of injection, clean the skin with an alcohol swab, and prepare site of injection antiseptically as advised by your doctor.
Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster.
12.
Unscrew the syringe to disconnect the vial (I).
13.
Attach the syringe to the venipuncture set by screwing it clockwise and ensure that no blood enters the syringe (J).
14.
Remove tourniquet!
15.
Inject the solution intravenously over several minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the needle.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort (maximum rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
16.
If a further dose is required, remove the empty syringe by turning it anti-clockwise.
Connect the newly prepared syringe.
17.
If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe.
Hold a swab firmly over the injection site on the outstretched arm for approx.
2 minutes.
Finally, apply a small pressure dressing to the wound.
The amount of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of factor VIII inhibitors that you may have and the factor VIII level required.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood.
He will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below.
I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
174
Degree of haemorrhage/
Factor VIII level
Frequency of doses (hours)/
Type of surgical procedure
required (%) (IU/ dl)
Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
Your doctor should always adapt the amount
of KOGENATE Bayer 250
IU to be administered and the
frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
If you are using KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.
This will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above, it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable.
If the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected.
By appropriate laboratory procedures, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor.
175 If you have the impression that the effect of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.
Patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of KOGENATE Bayer than previously to control a bleeding.
If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product, factor VIIa concentrate or (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.
Do not increase the dose of KOGENATE Bayer you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this.
These therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
Your doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is to be administered.
Usually, the substitution therapy with KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is a life-time treatment.
If you use more KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU than you should:
No symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
If you have used more KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU than you should, please inform your doctor.
If you forget to use KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU: • Proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. • Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses.
If you stop using KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU Do not stop using KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In rare cases, you may notice any of the following side effects after administration of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU: • rash/ itchy rash, local reactions at the injection site (e. g. burning sensation, temporary redness) • hypersensitivity reactions (e. g. tightness of the chest/ general feeling of being unwell, dizziness and nausea and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • unusual taste in the mouth • fever.
176 Furthermore, the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded.
If you notice any of the following symptoms during injection/ infusion: • chest tightness/ general feeling of being unwell • dizziness • mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • nausea this can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately.
Please consult your doctor immediately.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients.
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
You should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

HOW TO USE KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU
KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU is intended for intravenous administration only and must be administered immediately after reconstitution.
Aseptic conditions (meaning clean and germ free) are required during reconstitution and administration.
Use only the medical devices (powder vial with Bio-Set device, pre- filled syringe containing solvent and venipuncture set) for reconstitution and administration provided with each package of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU.
KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU must not be mixed with other infusion solutions.
Follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the instructions below as a guide:
1.
Wash hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
Ensure you prepare the solution on a clean and dry surface.
181 2.
Warm the unopened powder vial and the solvent syringe in your hands to approximately body temperature (do not exceed 37 °C).
Wipe any observable moisture from the vial.
3.
Remove the cap from the powder vial by gently moving it from side to side several times, whilst at the same time pulling upwards.
Remove the stopper attached to the white cap from the syringe (A).
4.
Gently screw the syringe on to the powder vial (B).
5.
Place the vial on a rigid, non-slip surface and hold it firmly with one hand.
Then, strongly press down the fingerplate near the syringe tip using your thumb and index finger (C) until the finger plate meets the top edge of the Bio-Set.
This indicates that the system is activated (D).
6.
Connect the plunger rod to the syringe by screwing it into the rubber stopper (E).
7.
Inject the solvent by slowly pushing the syringe’ s plunger down (F).
8.
Dissolve the powder by gently swirling the vial.
Do not shake the vial!
Ensure that the powder is completely dissolved before use.
Do not use solutions that contain visible particles or that are cloudy (G).
9.
Invert vial/ syringe and transfer the solution into syringe by drawing the plunger out slowly and smoothly (H).
Ensure that the entire contents of the vial are drawn into the syringe.
10.
If you need more than one dose, reconstitute the desired amount of product repeating steps 2. - 9.
Use separate syringes!
11.
Apply a tourniquet.
Determine the point of injection, clean the skin with an alcohol swab, and prepare site of injection antiseptically as advised by your doctor.
Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster.
12.
Unscrew the syringe to disconnect the vial (I).
13.
Attach the syringe to the venipuncture set by screwing it clockwise and ensure that no blood enters the syringe (J).
14.
Remove tourniquet!
15.
Inject the solution intravenously over several minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the needle.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort (maximum rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
16.
If a further dose is required, remove the empty syringe by turning it anti-clockwise.
Connect the newly prepared syringe.
17.
If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe.
Hold a swab firmly over the injection site on the outstretched arm for approx.
2 minutes.
Finally, apply a small pressure dressing to the wound.
The amount of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of factor VIII inhibitors that you may have and the factor VIII level required.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood.
He will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below.
I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
182
Degree of haemorrhage/
Factor VIII level
Frequency of doses (hours)/
Type of surgical procedure
required (%) (IU/ dl)
Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
Your doctor should always adapt the amount
of KOGENATE Bayer 500
IU to be administered and the
frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
If you are using KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.
This will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above, it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable.
If the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected.
By appropriate laboratory procedures, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor.
183 If you have the impression that the effect of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.
Patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of KOGENATE Bayer than previously to control a bleeding.
If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product, factor VIIa concentrate or (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.
Do not increase the dose of KOGENATE Bayer you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this.
These therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
Your doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU is to be administered.
Usually, the substitution therapy with KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU is a life-time treatment.
If you use more KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU than you should:
No symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
If you have used more KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU than you should, please inform your doctor.
If you forget to use KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU: • Proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. • Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses.
If you stop using KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU Do not stop using KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In rare cases, you may notice any of the following side effects after administration of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU: • rash/ itchy rash, local reactions at the injection site (e. g. burning sensation, temporary redness) • hypersensitivity reactions (e. g. tightness of the chest/ general feeling of being unwell, dizziness and nausea and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • unusual taste in the mouth • fever.
184 Furthermore, the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded.
If you notice any of the following symptoms during injection/ infusion: • chest tightness/ general feeling of being unwell • dizziness • mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • nausea this can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately.
Please consult your doctor immediately.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients.
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
You should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

2.
BEFORE YOU USE KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU
Do not use KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to octocog alfa, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU.
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Take special care with KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU as there is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction).
If you experience tightness in the chest, feeling dizzy, feeling sick or faint, or experience dizziness on standing, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU.
If this occurs, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.
188 Your doctor may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate factor VIII levels.
If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU, consult your doctor immediately.
You may have developed factor VIII inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this.
Factor VIII inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which block the factor VIII you are using.
This makes factor VIII less effective in controlling bleeding.
If you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back.
Using other medicines Interactions with other medicines are not known.
However, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding consult your doctor before using this product.
Driving and using machines:
No effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been observed.

The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

WHAT KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
The vial with powder for solution for injection nominally contains 2000 IU octocog alfa (IU equals International Units).
After reconstitution with the appropriate volume of solvent (water for injections), each vial contains octocog alfa 400 IU/ ml.
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII (ATC-Code B02B D02).
KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU is used for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
Each pack of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU contains a vial with Bio-Set transfer device and a pre-filled syringe with a separate plunger rod, as well as a venipuncture set, two alcohol swabs, two dry swabs and two plasters.
The vial contains a dry white to slightly yellow powder or cake.
The pre-filled syringe contains water for injections to be used to reconstitute the contents of the vial.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU
Do not use KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to octocog alfa, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU.
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Take special care with KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU as there is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction).
If you experience tightness in the chest, feeling dizzy, feeling sick or faint, or experience dizziness on standing, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU.
If this occurs, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.
196 Your doctor may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate factor VIII levels.
If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU, consult your doctor immediately.
You may have developed factor VIII inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this.
Factor VIII inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which block the factor VIII you are using.
This makes factor VIII less effective in controlling bleeding.
If you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back.
Using other medicines Interactions with other medicines are not known.
However, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding consult your doctor before using this product.
Driving and using machines:
No effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been observed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU This medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
3.
HOW TO USE KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU
KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU is intended for intravenous administration only and must be administered immediately after reconstitution.
Aseptic conditions (meaning clean and germ free) are required during reconstitution and administration.
Use only the medical devices (powder vial with Bio-Set device, pre- filled syringe containing solvent and venipuncture set) for reconstitution and administration provided with each package of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU.
KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU must not be mixed with other infusion solutions.
Follow the directions given by your doctor closely and use the instructions below as a guide:
1.
Wash hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
Ensure you prepare the solution on a clean and dry surface.
197 2.
Warm the unopened powder vial and the solvent syringe in your hands to approximately body temperature (do not exceed 37 °C).
Wipe any observable moisture from the vial.
3.
Remove the cap from the powder vial by gently moving it from side to side several times, whilst at the same time pulling upwards.
Remove the stopper attached to the white cap from the syringe (A).
4.
Gently screw the syringe on to the powder vial (B).
5.
Place the vial on a rigid, non-slip surface and hold it firmly with one hand.
Then, strongly press down the fingerplate near the syringe tip using your thumb and index finger (C) until the finger plate meets the top edge of the Bio-Set.
This indicates that the system is activated (D).
6.
Connect the plunger rod to the syringe by screwing it into the rubber stopper (E).
7.
Inject the solvent by slowly pushing the syringe’ s plunger down (F).
8.
Dissolve the powder by gently swirling the vial.
Do not shake the vial!
Ensure that the powder is completely dissolved before use.
Do not use solutions that contain visible particles or that are cloudy (G).
9.
Invert vial/ syringe and transfer the solution into syringe by drawing the plunger out slowly and smoothly (H).
Ensure that the entire contents of the vial are drawn into the syringe.
10.
If you need more than one dose, reconstitute the desired amount of product repeating steps 2. - 9.
Use separate syringes!
11.
Apply a tourniquet.
Determine the point of injection, clean the skin with an alcohol swab, and prepare site of injection antiseptically as advised by your doctor.
Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster.
12.
Unscrew the syringe to disconnect the vial (I).
13.
Attach the syringe to the venipuncture set by screwing it clockwise and ensure that no blood enters the syringe (J).
14.
Remove tourniquet!
15.
Inject the solution intravenously over several minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the needle.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort (maximum rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
16.
If a further dose is required, remove the empty syringe by turning it anti-clockwise.
Connect the newly prepared syringe.
17.
If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe.
Hold a swab firmly over the injection site on the outstretched arm for approx.
2 minutes.
Finally, apply a small pressure dressing to the wound.
The amount of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of factor VIII inhibitors that you may have and the factor VIII level required.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood.
He will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below.
I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
198
Degree of haemorrhage/
Factor VIII level
Frequency of doses (hours)/
Type of surgical procedure
required (%) (IU/ dl)
Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
Your doctor should always adapt the amount of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU to be administered and the frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
If you are using KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.
This will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above, it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable.
If the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected.
By appropriate laboratory procedures, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor.
199 If you have the impression that the effect of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.
Patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of KOGENATE Bayer than previously to control a bleeding.
If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product, factor VIIa concentrate or (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.
Do not increase the dose of KOGENATE Bayer you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this.
These therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
Your doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU is to be administered.
Usually, the substitution therapy with KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU is a life-time treatment.
If you use more KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU than you should:
No symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
If you have used more KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU than you should, please inform your doctor.
If you forget to use KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU: • Proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. • Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses.
If you stop using KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU Do not stop using KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In rare cases, you may notice any of the following side effects after administration of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU: • rash/ itchy rash, local reactions at the injection site (e. g. burning sensation, temporary redness) • hypersensitivity reactions (e. g. tightness of the chest/ general feeling of being unwell, dizziness and nausea and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • unusual taste in the mouth • fever.
200 Furthermore, the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded.
If you notice any of the following symptoms during injection/ infusion: • chest tightness/ general feeling of being unwell • dizziness • mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • nausea this can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately.
Please consult your doctor immediately.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients.
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
You should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

The amount of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of factor VIII inhibitors that you may have and the factor VIII level required.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood.
He will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below.
206 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/
Factor VIII level
Frequency of doses (hours)/
Type of surgical procedure
required (%) (IU/ dl)
Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
Your doctor should always adapt the amount of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU to be administered and the frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
If you are using KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.
This will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above, it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that
207 adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable.
If the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected.
By appropriate laboratory procedures, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor.
If you have the impression that the effect of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.
Patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of KOGENATE Bayer than previously to control a bleeding.
If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product, factor VIIa concentrate or (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.
Do not increase the dose of KOGENATE Bayer you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this.
These therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
Your doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is to be administered.
Usually, the substitution therapy with KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is a life-time treatment.
If you use more KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU than you should:
No symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
If you have used more KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU than you should, please inform your doctor.
If you forget to use KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU: • Proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. • Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses.
If you stop using KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU Do not stop using KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In rare cases, you may notice any of the following side effects after administration of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU: • rash/ itchy rash, local reactions at the injection site (e. g. burning sensation, temporary redness) • hypersensitivity reactions (e. g. tightness of the chest/ general feeling of being unwell, dizziness and nausea and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • unusual taste in the mouth • fever.
208 Furthermore, the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded.
If you notice any of the following symptoms during injection/ infusion: • chest tightness/ general feeling of being unwell • dizziness • mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • nausea this can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately.
Please consult your doctor immediately.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients.
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
You should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

WHAT KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
The vial with powder for solution for injection nominally contains 500 IU octocog alfa (IU equals International Units).
After reconstitution with the appropriate volume of solvent (water for injections), each vial contains octocog alfa 200 IU/ ml.
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII (ATC-Code B02B D02).
KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU is used for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
Each pack of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU contains a vial and a pre-filled syringe with a separate plunger rod, as well as a vial adapter, a venipuncture set, two alcohol swabs, two dry swabs and two plasters.
The vial contains a dry white to slightly yellow powder or cake.
The pre-filled syringe contains water for injections to be used to reconstitute the contents of the vial.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU
Do not use KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to octocog alfa, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU.
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Take special care with KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU as there is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction).
If you experience tightness in the chest, feeling dizzy, feeling sick or faint, or experience dizziness on standing, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU.
If this occurs, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.
212 Your doctor may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate factor VIII levels.
If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU, consult your doctor immediately.
You may have developed factor VIII inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this.
Factor VIII inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which block the factor VIII you are using.
This makes factor VIII less effective in controlling bleeding.
If you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back.
Using other medicines Interactions with other medicines are not known.
However, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding consult your doctor before using this product.
Driving and using machines:
No effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been observed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU This medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.

After reconstitution with the appropriate volume of solvent (water for injections), each vial contains octocog alfa 400 IU/ ml.
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII (ATC-Code B02B D02).
KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is used for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
Each pack of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU contains a vial and a pre-filled syringe with a separate plunger rod, as well as a vial adapter, a venipuncture set, two alcohol swabs, two dry swabs and two plasters.
The vial contains a dry white to slightly yellow powder or cake.
The pre-filled syringe contains water for injections to be used to reconstitute the contents of the vial.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU
Do not use KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to octocog alfa, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU.
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Take special care with KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU as there is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction).
If you experience tightness in the chest, feeling dizzy, feeling sick or faint, or experience dizziness on standing, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU.
If this occurs, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.
220 Your doctor may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate factor VIII levels.
If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU, consult your doctor immediately.
You may have developed factor VIII inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out tests to confirm this.
Factor VIII inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which block the factor VIII you are using.
This makes factor VIII less effective in controlling bleeding.
If you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back.
Using other medicines Interactions with other medicines are not known.
However, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding consult your doctor before using this product.
Driving and using machines:
No effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been observed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU This medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
3.

2 ml/ min).
18.
If a further dose needs to be administered, use a new syringe with product reconstituted as described above.
19.
If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe.
Hold a swab firmly over the injection site on the outstretched arm for approx.
2 minutes.
Finally, apply a small pressure dressing to the wound.
The amount of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of factor VIII inhibitors that you may have and the factor VIII level required.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood.
He will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below.
222 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/
Factor VIII level
Frequency of doses (hours)/
Type of surgical procedure
required (%) (IU/ dl)
Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
Your doctor should always adapt the amount of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU to be administered and the frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
If you are using KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.
This will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above, it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that
223 adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable.
If the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected.
By appropriate laboratory procedures, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor.
If you have the impression that the effect of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.
Patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of KOGENATE Bayer than previously to control a bleeding.
If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product, factor VIIa concentrate or (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.
Do not increase the dose of KOGENATE Bayer you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this.
These therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
Your doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is to be administered.
Usually, the substitution therapy with KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is a life-time treatment.
If you use more KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU than you should:
No symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
If you have used more KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU than you should, please inform your doctor.
If you forget to use KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU: • Proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. • Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses.
If you stop using KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU Do not stop using KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In rare cases, you may notice any of the following side effects after administration of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU: • rash/ itchy rash, local reactions at the injection site (e. g. burning sensation, temporary redness) • hypersensitivity reactions (e. g. tightness of the chest/ general feeling of being unwell, dizziness and nausea and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • unusual taste in the mouth • fever.
224 Furthermore, the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded.
If you notice any of the following symptoms during injection/ infusion: • chest tightness/ general feeling of being unwell • dizziness • mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • nausea this can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately.
Please consult your doctor immediately.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients.
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
You should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

The amount of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of factor VIII inhibitors that you may have and the factor VIII level required.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood.
He will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below.
230 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/
Factor VIII level
Frequency of doses (hours)/
Type of surgical procedure
required (%) (IU/ dl)
Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
Your doctor should always adapt the amount of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU to be administered and the frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
If you are using KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.
This will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above, it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that
231 adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable.
If the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected.
By appropriate laboratory procedures, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor.
If you have the impression that the effect of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.
Patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of KOGENATE Bayer than previously to control a bleeding.
If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product, factor VIIa concentrate or (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.
Do not increase the dose of KOGENATE Bayer you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this.
These therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
Your doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU is to be administered.
Usually, the substitution therapy with KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU is a life-time treatment.
If you use more KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU than you should:
No symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
If you have used more KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU than you should, please inform your doctor.
If you forget to use KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU: • Proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. • Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses.
If you stop using KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU Do not stop using KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In rare cases, you may notice any of the following side effects after administration of KOGENATE Bayer 2000 IU: • rash/ itchy rash, local reactions at the injection site (e. g. burning sensation, temporary redness) • hypersensitivity reactions (e. g. tightness of the chest/ general feeling of being unwell, dizziness and nausea and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • unusual taste in the mouth • fever.
232 Furthermore, the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded.
If you notice any of the following symptoms during injection/ infusion: • chest tightness/ general feeling of being unwell • dizziness • mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • nausea this can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately.
Please consult your doctor immediately.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients.
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
You should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
