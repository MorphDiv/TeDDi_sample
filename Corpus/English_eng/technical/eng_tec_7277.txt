Introduction to the Banshee User Interface

Banshee Media Player

Sources
Your music and video sources are shown on the left in Banshee. The sources give you quick access to your Play Queue, Music, Videos, Amazon, Last.fm, Podcasts and more.
The menu choices will change depending on the source you have chosen. For example, to use the menu to import a Podcast, you will need to choose the Podcast source. The menu option for importing a Podcast is not available when viewing the video or music library.
Library Browser
When you select a music or video source from Sources, Banshee will display your content in the Library browser. Depending on the source you choose, Banshee can display your music or video library, Podcast subscriptions or even the Amazon Music Store to allow you to buy music.
Now Playing View
Helpful when using Banshee in full screen mode, the Now Playing mode hides the library to give you a larger view of the music or video you're watching. When listening to music, the Now Playing view will show you the artist name, album and cover art if available. If you are watching a video, Banshee will display the video.
To change Now Playing to hide the Banshee user interface and use the full screen mode, you can press the
Library
The Library view in Banshee will change depending on the Source you have chosen. The Music Library will display cover art, artists in your library, and list of songs. The Podcast Library will display your Podcast subscriptions, podcasts that are downloaded or not downloaded, and all, new or old podcasts. Please see each Source's help page for detailed information on managing a source.
Sync your media to a portable media player or smartphone.
Sync
Banshee supports syncing your music to portable media players and smartphones. You can add specific music tracks, albums or playlist or allow Banshee to keep your music player in sync with your entire library. After your player is connected to your computer you can also play back the songs on your portable player in Banshee. When syncing music in a lossless format, such as FLAC, Banshee will automatically transcode your music for you to a lossy format such as Ogg Vorbis or MP3, if you have the correct codecs installed.
Device Support
Banshee supports almost all modern portable music players and smartphones with the notable exception of the Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.
When you plug your device in, Banshee will display it in the left menu. Pressing the device icon will take you to your device home page in Banshee displaying your sync preferences.
Sync Your Music
You can choose to manage the media on your portable music by having Banshee automatically sync it or manage your music and media manually.
Choose your device from the Banshee menu and then choose how you want to sync your media, including:
Music
Audiobooks
Videos
Podcast
From the dropdown menu next to each of the media, choose from:
Manage manually
Sync entire library
If you choose to sync your entire library automatically with your portable media player make sure your portable media player has enough storage space. If your library is larger than the space on your portable media player, Banshee will sync media until your player is full and then stop.
If you have created playlists or smart playlists in your music library, they will also be displayed as a sync option for Music. This can be helpful when creating smart playlists, as smart playlists will automatically update as new content is added based on the playlist rules, and Banshee will sync the new playlist to your device every time you plug it in.
Banshee will display the total hard drive space of your portable music player in a graph in the bottom center of Banshee. The graph will show you how much space is taken by audio files, video, other and free space. Directly below that Banshee will show you how many total items are stored on your portable music player, how many hours or days of listening that is equal to, and total space used.
Sync Your Entire Library
You can drag and drop media to your portable music player from Banshee. Select the file or files you want to copy to your portable media player and then press and hold your right mouse button and drag the file(s) to your portable media player icon in Banshee. This will copy the files to your device.
If your music library is encoded in a format that your portable media player does not support, such as OGG or FLAC, and you have the necessary codecs installed, Banshee can automatically transcode these files to MP3 when transferring to your portable media player. Check with your Linux distribution for the necessary codecs as it is outside the scope of this help and varies by distribution.
You may need to eject your device to load the files correctly on your portable music player. To eject your device in Banshee, using your mouse right click the device in the Banshee menu and press
Play Music From Your Portable Music Player
You can play music stored on your portable music player directly in Banshee. Choose your player in the Banshee menu on the left and your portable music player's library will be displayed. You can then play music in Banshee just as you would music in your own library.
Remove Music From your Portable Music Player
To remove songs stored on your portable music player, choose your player in Banshee to view its library. Then choose the tracks you would like to remove and right click the tracks and choose
Deleting files from your portable music player will permanently remove the files and you will not be able to recover them.

Digital music contains metadata that stores information in the music file including the artist, album, year recorded, genre, and more.

For more information on ripping CDs and including the metadata see the

Some portable media players even allow you to transfer the playlist so you can take it with you on the go.
Banshee supports normal playlists, which include songs you add to the playlist, as well as smart playlists. Smart Playlists are automatically generated playlists based on your listening habits, favorite music, or more.

Amazon MP3 Store
Banshee supports downloading and importing music from the Amazon MP3 store. You can manually import Amazon music files, purchase music in your web browser or buy music inside of Banshee. Amazon only offers music for sale as an MP3 in certain countries and depending on your location, you may not be able to buy Amazon MP3s.
Banshee uses an Amazon affiliate code for all music purchases. All money made via this affiliate code is donated to the GNOME Foundation.
Purchase Amazon MP3s in your web browser
Music purchased from Amazon's MP3 store can be automatically downloaded and imported into Banshee. Banshee associates itself with the .amz file Amazon provides for MP3 purchases. When you buy music on Amazon, your web browser will download the .amz file and Banshee will automatically open it and begin the download and import the music.
Buy Amazon MP3s in Banshee
You can also search for songs on Amazon within Banshee. Choose the Amazon MP3 Store from the Banshee menu on the left. This will load the Amazon MP3 Store just as if you were in a web browser. You can search Amazon for the music you wish to buy and after logging in to Amazon, buy music with one click. Banshee will automatically download and import your purchase into the library.
Import Amazon MP3s manually
When music is purchased from Amazon in a web browser, a file with the extension .amz is downloaded and saved to your hard drive. To import music purchased manually from Amazon, in Banshee choose
Amazon .amz files are only active for a short time. If you do not download your music quickly, the file will expire and you cannot download your music from Amazon. Amazon does not publish how long files are active. It is recommended you download and import any purchases from Amazon within an hour of purchase.
