The gettext functions implement an NLS (Native Language Support) API which can be used to internationalize your PHP applications.
Please see the gettext documentation for your system for a thorough explanation of these functions or view the docs at http: / /www.gnu.org / manual / gettext / index.html.
To use these functions you must download and install the GNU gettext package from http: / /www.gnu.org / software / gettext / gettext.html
To include GNU gettext support in your PHP build you must add the option --with-gettext[ =DIR] where DIR is the gettext install directory, defaults to / usr / local.
Note to Win32 Users:
In order to enable this module on a Windows environment, you must copy gnu_gettext.dll from the DLL folder of the PHP / Win32 binary package to the SYSTEM32 folder of your windows machine. (Ex:
C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32).
Starting with PHP 4.2.3 the name changed to libintl-1.dll
