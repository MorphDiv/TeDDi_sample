The input line is where you type messages to be sent the channel, query, or server. A message sent to a channel is seen by everyone on the channel, whereas a message in a query is sent only to the person in the query with you. To automatically complete the nickname you began typing, press Tab. If you have not begun typing, the last successfully completed nickname will be used. You can also send special commands: / me action shows up as an action in the channel or query. For example: / me sings a song will show up in the channel as'Nick sings a song '. / whois nickname shows information about this person, including what channels they are in. For more commands, see the Konversation Handbook. A message cannot contain multiple lines.

Identity:
Choose an existing Identity or click the Edit button to add a new Identity or edit an existing one. The Identity will identify you and determine your nickname when you connect to the network.
Commands:
Optional. This command will be sent to the server after connecting. Example: / msg NickServ IDENTIFY konvirocks. This example is for the freenode network, which requires users to register their nickname with a password and login when connecting. konvirocks is the password for the nickname given in Identity. You may enter more than one command by separating them with semicolons.
Check here if you want Konversation to automatically connect to this network whenever you open Konversation.

Servers
This is a list of IRC Servers in the network. When connecting to the network, Konversation will attempt to connect to the top server first. If this fails, it will attempt the second server.

This shows the list of configured IRC networks. An IRC network is a collection of cooperating servers. You need only connect to one of the servers in the network to be connected to the entire IRC network. Once connected, Konversation will automatically join the channels shown. When Konversation is started for the first time, the Freenode network and the #kde channel are already entered for you.

Check if you want to use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to communicate with the server. This protects the privacy of your communications between your computer and the IRC server.

& Real name:
Enter your real name here. IRC is not intended to keep you hidden from your friends or enemies. Keep this in mind if you are tempted to behave maliciously. A fake "real name" can be a good way to mask your gender from all the nerds out there, but the PC you use can always be traced so you will never be truly anonymous.
This is your list of nicknames. A nickname is the name that other users will know you by. You may use any name you desire. The first character must be a letter. Since nicknames must be unique across an entire IRC network, your desired name may be rejected by the server because someone else is already using that nickname. Enter alternate nicknames for yourself. If your first choice is rejected by the server, Konversation will try the alternate nicknames.
Auto Identify
Service:
Service name can be nickserv or a network-dependent name such as nickserv@services. dal. net
Password:
If you check this box, whenever you perform an / away command, a horizontal line will appear in the channel, marking the point where you went away. Other IRC users do not see this horizontal line.
Mark the last position in chat windows when going away
Away nickname:
Enter a nickname that indicates you are away. Whenever you perform an / away msg command in any channel joined with this Identity, Konversation will automatically change your nickname to the Away nickname. Other users will be able to tell you are away from your computer. Whenever you perform an / away command in any channel in which you are away, Konversation will automatically change your nickname back to the original. If you do not wish to automatically change your nickname when going away, leave blank.
If you check this box, Konversation will automatically set all connections using this Identity away when the screensaver starts or after a period of user inactivity configured below.
Automatic Away

of user inactivity
If you check this box, Konversation will automatically cancel away for all connections using this Identity when the screensaver stops or new user activity is detected.
Automatically return on activity
If you check this box, Konversation will automatically send the Away message to all channels joined with this Identity. %s is replaced with msg. Whenever you perform an / away command, the Return message will be displayed in all channels joined with this Identity.

& Pre-shell command:
Here you can enter a command to be executed before connection to server starts If you have multiple servers in this identity this command will be executed for each server
& Encoding:
This setting affects how characters you type are encoded for sending to the server. It also affects how messages are displayed. When you first open Konversation, it automatically retrieves this setting from the operating system. If you seem to be having trouble seeing other user's messages correctly, try changing this setting.
Ident:
When you connect, many servers query your computer for an IDENT response. If you computer is not running an IDENT server, this response is sent by Konversation. No spaces are allowed.
& Quit reason:
Whenever you leave a server, this message is shown to others.
Konversation terminated.
& Part reason:
Whenever you leave a channel, this message is sent to the channel.
& Kick reason:
Whenever you are kicked from a channel (usually by an IRC operator), this message is sent to the channel.
User terminated.

ECB or Electronic Codebook mode is supported by many encryption clients like FiSH and Mircryption however it is generally considered to be insecure. CBC or Cipher Block Chaining mode is not supported by FiSH but is supported by Mircryption. If you are going to use key exchange it is best to first find out if your peer has a client that can use CBC otherwise you will be able to see what they are saying, but they will not be able to read what you are saying.

No matches found for "%1".
Reverse-resolving requires KDE version 3.5.1 or higher.
Connection is secured with %1 bit SSL.
The functionality to connect to servers using encrypted SSL communications is not available to Konversation because OpenSSL support was not enabled at compile time. You will need to get new version of KDE that has SSL support.
The SSL certificate returned from the server was not recognized. Maybe this server does not support SSL on the given port? If this server supports normal, non-SSL communications as well, then SSL will be on a different port.
The IP address of the host %1 does not match the one the certificate was issued to.
Would you like to accept this certificate forever without being prompted?
