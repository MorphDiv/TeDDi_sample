Decides if the buttons for the special Spanish characters are visible.
Decides if the KVTML-files are loaded automatically.
Decides whether a verb selection will be used or the entire verb stock.
Trained verbs that are not in the user's verb selection are added to the selection automatically.
The user can select verbs they know and want to practice using a verb selection - a subset of all verbs. In some trainers the user can be faced with verbs that are not yet in the selection; for example, in the VerbViewTrainer if a word is entered that is not yet in the selection. If this option is set, such verbs are added automatically to the list.
Decides whether the accents are ignored while correcting input or not.
If true, the Spanish infinitive will always be used.
If a KVTML file is loaded, there might be a translation for a verb. In this case, the program can present the verb either in Spanish; according to the translation; or an arbitrary mix of the two.
If true, the Foreign infinitive will always be used.
If true, the Spanish and foreign infinitives will be used arbitrarily.
