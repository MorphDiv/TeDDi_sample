(PHP 4 = 4.0.4)
Returns TRUE if every character in text is a letter from the current locale, FALSE otherwise.
In the standard C locale letters are just [A-Za-z] and ctype_alpha() is equivalent to (ctype_upper($text) | | ctype_lower($text)), but other languages have letters that are considered neither upper nor lower case.
See also ctype_upper(), ctype_lower(), and setlocale().
