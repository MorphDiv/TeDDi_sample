EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ALLI1
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Alli?
Alli is a medicine that contains the active substance orlistat.
It is available as turquoise capsules (60 mg).
What is Alli used for?
Alli is used to help patients lose weight.
It is used in adults who are overweight with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 28 kg per square metre, in combination with a low-calorie diet with reduced fat levels.
The medicine can be obtained without a prescription.
How is Alli used?
Alli is taken as one capsule with water just before, during, or up to one hour after each main meal, three times a day.
If a meal is missed or contains no fat, Alli should not be taken.
The patient should be on a diet in which about 30% of the calories come from fat.
The food in the diet should be spread over three main meals.
Patients taking Alli should start a diet and exercise regime before beginning treatment.
If patients taking Alli have been unable to lose weight after 12 weeks, they should speak to their doctor or pharmacist.
It may be necessary to stop treatment.
How does Alli work?
The active substance in Alli, orlistat, is an anti-obesity medicine, which does not affect appetite.
Orlistat blocks gastrointestinal lipases (enzymes that digest fat).
When these enzymes are blocked, they cannot digest some fats in the diet, and this allows about a quarter of the fat eaten in the meal to pass through the gut undigested.
The body cannot use this dietary fat for energy or convert it into fat tissue.
This helps weight reduction.
How has Alli been studied?
Because Alli is based on another medicine containing the same active substance already authorised in the EU (Xenical 120 mg capsules), some of the studies involved patients who took Xenical.

Alli has been studied in three main studies.
Two of the studies involving a total of 1,353 overweight or obese patients with a BMI of 28 kg/ m2 or more and lasted from one to two years, comparing Alli given at different doses with placebo (a dummy treatment), in combination with dieting.
Neither the patients nor the doctors knew which treatment each patient was taking until the end of the study.
The third study compared Alli with placebo in 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg/ m2.
The study lasted four months.
In all of the studies, the main measure of effectiveness was the change in weight.
What benefit has Alli shown during the studies?
Alli was more effective than placebo in producing a reduction in weight in patients with a BMI of 28 kg/ m2 or more.
In the two studies of patients with a BMI of 28 kg/ m2 or more, patients taking Alli 60 mg had lost an average of 4.8 kg after a year, compared with 2.3 kg in those taking placebo.
The study of Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg/ m2 failed to show a degree of weight loss that would be relevant for patients.
What is the risk associated with Alli?
Most of the side effects with Alli affect the digestive system and are less likely to occur with a low fat diet.
In general, they are mild, and occur at the beginning of treatment, going away after some time.
The most common side effects with Alli (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are oily spotting, flatus (gas) with discharge, faecal urgency (urgent need to open the bowels), fatty oily stool, oily evacuation (faeces), flatulence (gas) and soft stools.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Alli, see the Package Leaflet.
Alli should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to orlistat or any of the other ingredients.
It must not be used in people who are being treated with ciclosporin (used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines used to prevent blood clots such as warfarin.
It must also not be used in people with a long-term malabsorption disease (where nutrients from food are not easily absorbed during digestion) or cholestasis (a liver disorder), or in women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Why has Alli been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that the benefits of Alli are greater than its risks for weight loss in adults who are overweight (BMI ≥ 28 kg/ m2), taken in conjunction with a mildly hypocalorific, lower-fat diet.
The Committee recommended that Alli be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Alli:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Orlistat GSK to Glaxo Group Limited on 23 July 2007.
This authorisation was based on the authorisation already granted in 1998 to Xenical capsules.
The name of the medicine was changed to Alli on 12 September 2008.
