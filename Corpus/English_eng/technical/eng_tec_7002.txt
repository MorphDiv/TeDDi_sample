Overview
Example for the
Original image

This filter inverts Value (luminosity) of the active layer or selection. Hue and Saturation will not be affected, although the color will sometimes be slightly different because of round-off error. If you want to invert Hue and Saturation also, use
Note that hue and saturation can be distorted quite a bit when applying twice this filter for colors with a high luminosity (for instance, HSV 102°,100%, 98%, a bright green, gives HSV 96°, 100%, 2% after a first application of the filter , and 96°, 100%, 98% after a second application). Thus, you should not expect to be able to apply this filter twice in a row and get back the image you started with.
Example of using this filter twice

GEGL
GEGL (Generic Graphics Library) is a graph based image processing framework that will be used in all GIMP-3.0. With GEGL, the internal processing is being done in 32bit floating point linear light RGBA. By default the legacy 8bit code paths are still used, but a curious user can turn on the use of GEGL for the color operations with this option.
In addition to porting color operations to GEGL, an experimental

Retinex


Retinex improves visual rendering of an image when lighting conditions are not good. While our eye can see colors correctly when light is low, cameras and video cams can't manage this well. The MSRCR (MultiScale Retinex with Color Restoration) algorithm, which is at the root of the Retinex filter, is inspired by the eye biological mechanisms to adapt itself to these conditions. Retinex stands for Retina + cortex.
Besides digital photography, Retinex algorithm is used to make the information in astronomical photos visible and detect, in medicine, poorly visible structures in X-rays or scanners.
This filter is found in the image window menu under
Options

These options call for notions that only mathematicians and imagery engineers can understand. In actual practice, the user has to grope about for the best setting. However, the following explanations should help out the experimented GIMP user.

Uniform
Uniform tends to treat both low and high intensity areas fairly.
Low

High

Scale
Determines the depth of the Retinex scale. Minimum value is 16, a value providing gross, unrefined filtering. Maximum value is 250. Optimal and default value is 240.
Scale division
Determines the number of iterations in the multiscale Retinex filter. The minimum required, and the recommended value is three. Only one or two scale divisions removes the multiscale aspect and falls back to a single scale Retinex filtering. A value that is too high tends to introduce noise in the picture.
Dynamic
As the MSR algorithm tends to make the image lighter, this slider allows you to adjust color saturation contamination around the new average color. A higher value means less color saturation. This is definitely the parameter you want to tweak for optimal results, because its effect is extremely image-dependent.

Example for

The Color to Alpha command makes transparent all pixels of the active layer that have a selected color. An Alpha channel is created. It will attempt to preserve anti-aliasing information by using a partially intelligent routine that replaces weak color information with weak alpha information. In this way, areas that contain an element of the selected color will maintain a blended appearance with their surrounding pixels.

Stretching

Some of the commands stretch the three color channels equally, so that the hues are not changed. Other commands stretch each of the color channels separately, which changes the hues.
The way the stretching is done varies with the different commands and the results look different. It is not easy to predict exactly what each command will do. If you know exactly what you are doing, you can get the same results, and even more, with the
