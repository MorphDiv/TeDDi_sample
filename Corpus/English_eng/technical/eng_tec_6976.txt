Overview
Applying example of the Sobel filter
Original image
Filter
Sobel's filter detects horizontal and vertical edges separately on a scaled image. Color images are turned into RGB scaled images. As with the Laplace filter, the result is a transparent image with black lines and some rest of colors.

This option allows you to set how the filter will work if you have selected one direction for use only: a flat relief with bumps and hollows will be created.

Introduction
Edge-Detect
Edge detect filters search for borders between different colors and so can detect contours of objects.
They are used to make selections and for many artistic purposes.
Most of them are based on gradient calculation methods and give thick border lines. Look at fig.1 which represents color intensity variations. On the left is a slow color gradient which is not a border. On the right is a quick variation which is an edge. Now, let us calculate the gradient, the variation speed, of this edge, i.e. the first derivative (fig.2). We have to decide that a border is detected when gradient is more than a threshold value (the exact border is at top of the curve, but this top varies according to borders). In most cases, threshold is under top and border is thick.
The Laplacian edge detection uses the second derivative (fig.3). The top of the curve is now at zero and clearly identified. That's why Laplace filter renders a thin border, only a pixel wide. But this derivative gives several zeros corresponding to small ripples, resulting in false edges.
Some blurring before applying edge filters is often necessary: it flattens small ripples in signal and so prevents false edges.

Algorithm
Edge detector offers several detection methods:
Here, this method has no options and so is less interesting than the specific Sobel.
Result doesn't look different from Sobel.
Edges are thinner, less contrasted and more blurred than Sobel.
No evident difference from Sobel.
Edges less bright.
Less interesting than the specific one.
A low value results in black, high-contrasted image with thin edges. A high value results in thick edges with low contrast and many colors in dark areas.

Where the edge detector will get adjoining pixels for its calculations when it is working on the image boundaries. This option will only have an effect on the boundaries of the result (if any).
