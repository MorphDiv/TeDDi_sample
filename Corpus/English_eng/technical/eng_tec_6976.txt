Introduction
& kcron; is an application for scheduling programs to run in the background. It is a graphical user interface to cron, the & UNIX; system scheduler.
Using & kcron;
Do n't forget to tell your system to start the crond cron daemon first, or & kcron; wo n't work.
& kcron; Start Up
When & kcron; starts you will see a summarized view of existing scheduled tasks and associated environment variables. If you are running as the root user, you will see these items for all users on the computer as well as the system scheduled tasks. Each of the folders can be expanded and contracted.

If a task has been disabled, no program file and parameters will appear, and the description will be disabled.
Environment Variables
Environment variables appear under a Variables folder. For each environment variable, the following are displayed:
Variable name.
Variable value.
Natural language description of variable.
