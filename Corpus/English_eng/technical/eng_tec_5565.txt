Possible meta characters are: nbsp;. - Matches any character nbsp; ^ - Matches the beginning of a line nbsp; $- Matches the end of a line nbsp; \\\\\\lt; - Matches the beginning of a word nbsp; \\\\\\gt; - Matches the end of a word The following repetition operators exist: nbsp;? - The preceding item is matched at most once nbsp; * - The preceding item is matched zero or more times nbsp; + - The preceding item is matched one or more times nbsp; {n} - The preceding item is matched exactly n times nbsp; {n,} - The preceding item is matched n or more times nbsp; {, n} - The preceding item is matched at most n times nbsp; {n, m} - The preceding item is matched at least n, but at most m times. Furthermore, backreferences to bracketed subexpressions are available via the notation\\\\ n.
Enter the file name pattern of the files to search here. You may give several patterns separated by commas.
Choose one search mode. For the first modes, the search pattern is build from the editable template, where '%s' is replaced by the given pattern. There are additional fixed predefined modes for environments, graphics, labels, references and input files. If the pattern is empty, Kile will search for all commands of this mode. If a pattern is given, it will be inserted as a parameter. For example, in environment mode with pattern'center ', Kile will search for '\\begin{center}', and in graphics mode with pattern '. *\\. png', Kile will search for all png files.
For the first three modes you can choose a template for the pattern from the combo box and edit it here. The string %s in the template is replaced by the pattern input field, resulting in the regular expression to search for. In all other modes this template is ignored.
Enter the directory which contains the files you want to search in.
Check this box to search in all subdirectories.
The results of the grep run are listed here. Select a filename/ line number combination with a mouse click on the item or with the cursor to show the respective line in the editor.

... that you can create your own templates? Create a document containing the text you usually start with and save it; then, select "Create Template from Document" from the "File" menu, fill in the dialog and you are done: next time you create a new document you can select the template from the template list.
... that Kile supports forward search? This enables you to switch back and forth between places in the source file and their corresponding locations in the DVI file. Stop spending so much time on finding the place in the source file: if you spotted a mistake while viewing the DVI, finding the correct location is just a mouse-click away! Read the manual to find out how to activate this feature.
... that the Quick Build tool is now fully configurable? Go to Settings- > Configure Kile- > Build and select the QuickBuild tool.
... that using projects gives Kile much more power? You can, for example, bundle and archive all related documents in a project; also, features like auto-completion of references and citations become much more powerful. Kile is even able to determine which document is the master document in a project.
... that you can configure which QuickBuild command is issued for a project? Just go to Project- > Project Options and select a QuickBuild command.
... that inserting references and citations has never been easier? Enable auto-completion and type in \\ref{, a list with all available labels will appear automatically (if auto-completion is not enabled, press Ctrl+Space). Note that this feature is much more powerful if the current document belongs to a project. You can configure auto-completion by going to Settings- > Configure Kile- > Complete; there, you can select databases of LaTeX commands. You can even create your own lists of commands.
... that Kile can complete LaTeX commands for you? Type \\se and press Ctrl+Space, a list of all commands starting with \\se will appear. You can configure auto-completion by going to Settings- > Configure Kile- > Complete; there, you can select databases of LaTeX commands. You can even create your own lists of commands.
... starting a new environment is very easy using the auto-complete feature. For example, type equ and press Alt+Space and a list of all environments starting with equ appears. Press Enter to select the first entry and a \\begin{equation}\\end{equation} pair is inserted in your document. You can configure auto-completion by going to Settings- > Configure Kile- > Complete; there, you can select databases of LaTeX commands. You can even create your own lists of commands.
... Kile now contains several editing tools to help you type in LaTeX faster and easier? Check out the Complete, Select, Delete, Environment and TeX Group menus in the Edit menu.
... that the Quick Preview tool will compile and select a part of a document? This can be a selected text, the current environment or the current subdocument. You can configure Quick preview by going to Settings- > Configure Kile- > Preview. There, you can select one of the predefined configurations.
... that a new wizard will help to create tabulars and arrays? A right click with the mouse will open a dialog or a popup menu, where a lot of attributes like alignment, colors, horizontal and vertical lines and more can be set. Also multicolumn cells are supported.
... that Kile can show user defined help files? Go to Settings- > Configure Kile- > Help and configure your help files, which are integrated into the help menu.
The project file of %1 was created by a newer version of kile. Opening it can lead to unexpected results. Do you really want to continue (not recommended)?
