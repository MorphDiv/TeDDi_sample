This list shows the Samba and NFS shared resources mounted on your system from other hosts. The "Type" column tells you whether the mounted resource is a Samba or an NFS type of resource. The "Resource" column shows the descriptive name of the shared resource. Finally, the third column, which is labeled "Mounted under" shows the location on your system where the shared resource is mounted.

& Statistics
The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs smbstatus and showmount. Smbstatus reports on current Samba connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements the SMB (Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or LanManager protocol. This protocol can be used to provide printer sharing or drive sharing services on a network including machines running the various flavors of Microsoft Windows.
