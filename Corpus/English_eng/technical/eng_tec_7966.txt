4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
2 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
3 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Dissolve the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of infusion:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
4 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and patients should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
In the interest of the patients, it is recommended that, whenever possible, every time that KOGENATE Bayer is administered to them, the name and the batch number of the product is registered.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table.
5 MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and lymphatic sytem disorders Gastrointestinal disorders
MedDRA Preferred Term Factor VIII inhibition Dysgeusia Nausea
General disorders and administration site conditions Immune system disorders Investigations Nervous system disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Injection site reaction Pyrexia Allergic / Anaphylactic reaction Blood pressure abnormal Dizziness Pruritus Rash
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII
(inhibitors) is a known complication in the
management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC-Code B02B D02.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to vWF in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor
6 IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Determination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor VIII.
The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs.
The degree and duration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of KOGENATE Bayer is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2% per IU/ kg body weight for KOGENATE Bayer.
This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma.
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours.
This is similar to that of plasma- derived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx.
13 hours.
Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for KOGENATE Bayer for bolus injection are: mean residence time [MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 ml/ h.
Mean baseline clearance for 14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 ml/ h corresponding to 3.0 ml/ h/ kg (range 1.6-4.6 ml/ h/ kg).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for KOGENATE Bayer in laboratory animals (mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog).
Specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species.
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of KOGENATE Bayer, since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of KOGENATE Bayer.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
10 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
11 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Dissolve the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of infusion:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
12 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and patients should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.

4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC-Code B02B D02.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to vWF in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor
14 IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Determination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor VIII.
The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs.
The degree and duration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of KOGENATE Bayer is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2% per IU/ kg body weight for KOGENATE Bayer.
This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma.
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours.
This is similar to that of plasma- derived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx.
13 hours.
Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for KOGENATE Bayer for bolus injection are: mean residence time [MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 ml/ h.
Mean baseline clearance for 14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 ml/ h corresponding to 3.0 ml/ h/ kg (range 1.6-4.6 ml/ h/ kg).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for KOGENATE Bayer in laboratory animals (mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog).
Specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species.
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of KOGENATE Bayer, since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of KOGENATE Bayer.

4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
18 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
19 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Dissolve the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of infusion:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
20 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and patients should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
In the interest of the patients, it is recommended that, whenever possible, every time that KOGENATE Bayer is administered to them, the name and the batch number of the product is registered.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table.
21 MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and lymphatic sytem disorders Gastrointestinal disorders
MedDRA Preferred Term Factor VIII inhibition Dysgeusia Nausea
General disorders and administration site conditions Immune system disorders Investigations Nervous system disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Injection site reaction Pyrexia Allergic / Anaphylactic reaction Blood pressure abnormal Dizziness Pruritus Rash
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
26 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
27 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Reconstitute the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
28 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and the patient should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table.
29 MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and lymphatic sytem disorders Gastrointestinal disorders
MedDRA Preferred Term Factor VIII inhibition Dysgeusia Nausea
General disorders and administration site conditions Immune system disorders Investigations Nervous system disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Injection site reaction Pyrexia Allergic / Anaphylactic reaction Blood pressure abnormal Dizziness Pruritus Rash
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC-Code B02B D02.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII
30 binds to vWF in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Determination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor VIII.
The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs.
The degree and duration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of KOGENATE Bayer is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2% per IU/ kg body weight for KOGENATE Bayer.
This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma.
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours.
This is similar to that of plasma- derived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx.
13 hours.
Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for KOGENATE Bayer for bolus injection are: mean residence time [MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 ml/ h.
Mean baseline clearance for 14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 ml/ h corresponding to 3.0 ml/ h/ kg (range 1.6-4.6 ml/ h/ kg).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for KOGENATE Bayer in laboratory animals (mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog).
Specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species.
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of KOGENATE Bayer, since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of KOGENATE Bayer.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
34 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
35 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Reconstitute the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
36 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and the patient should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
42 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
43 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Reconstitute the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
44 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and the patient should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table.
45 MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and lymphatic sytem disorders Gastrointestinal disorders
MedDRA Preferred Term Factor VIII inhibition Dysgeusia Nausea
General disorders and administration site conditions Immune system disorders Investigations Nervous system disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Injection site reaction Pyrexia Allergic / Anaphylactic reaction Blood pressure abnormal Dizziness Pruritus Rash
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC-Code B02B D02.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII
46 binds to vWF in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Determination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor VIII.
The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs.
The degree and duration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of KOGENATE Bayer is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2% per IU/ kg body weight for KOGENATE Bayer.
This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma.
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours.
This is similar to that of plasma- derived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx.
13 hours.
Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for KOGENATE Bayer for bolus injection are: mean residence time [MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 ml/ h.
Mean baseline clearance for 14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 ml/ h corresponding to 3.0 ml/ h/ kg (range 1.6-4.6 ml/ h/ kg).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for KOGENATE Bayer in laboratory animals (mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog).
Specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species.
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of KOGENATE Bayer, since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of KOGENATE Bayer.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
50 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
51 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Reconstitute the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
52 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and the patient should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table.

The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see section 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC-Code B02B D02.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII
54 binds to vWF in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Determination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor VIII.
The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs.
The degree and duration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of KOGENATE Bayer is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2% per IU/ kg body weight for KOGENATE Bayer.
This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma.
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours.
This is similar to that of plasma- derived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx.
13 hours.
Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for KOGENATE Bayer for bolus injection are: mean residence time [MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 ml/ h.
Mean baseline clearance for 14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 ml/ h corresponding to 3.0 ml/ h/ kg (range 1.6-4.6 ml/ h/ kg).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for KOGENATE Bayer in laboratory animals (mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog).
Specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species.
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of KOGENATE Bayer, since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of KOGENATE Bayer.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
58 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
59 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Reconstitute the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
60 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and patient should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table.
61 MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and lymphatic sytem disorders Gastrointestinal disorders
MedDRA Preferred Term Factor VIII inhibition Dysgeusia Nausea
General disorders and administration site conditions Immune system disorders Investigations Nervous system disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Injection site reaction Pyrexia Allergic / Anaphylactic reaction Blood pressure abnormal Dizziness Pruritus Rash
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC-Code B02B D02.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII
62 binds to vWF in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Determination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor VIII.
The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs.
The degree and duration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of KOGENATE Bayer is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2% per IU/ kg body weight for KOGENATE Bayer.
This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma.
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours.
This is similar to that of plasma- derived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx.
13 hours.
Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for KOGENATE Bayer for bolus injection are: mean residence time [MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 ml/ h.
Mean baseline clearance for 14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 ml/ h corresponding to 3.0 ml/ h/ kg (range 1.6-4.6 ml/ h/ kg).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for KOGENATE Bayer in laboratory animals (mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog).
Specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species.
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of KOGENATE Bayer, since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of KOGENATE Bayer.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
66 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
67 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Reconstitute the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
68 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and patient should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table.
69 MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and lymphatic sytem disorders Gastrointestinal disorders
MedDRA Preferred Term Factor VIII inhibition Dysgeusia Nausea
General disorders and administration site conditions Immune system disorders Investigations Nervous system disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Injection site reaction Pyrexia Allergic / Anaphylactic reaction Blood pressure abnormal Dizziness Pruritus Rash
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC-Code B02B D02.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII
70 binds to vWF in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Determination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor VIII.
The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs.
The degree and duration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of KOGENATE Bayer is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2% per IU/ kg body weight for KOGENATE Bayer.
This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma.
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours.
This is similar to that of plasma- derived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx.
13 hours.
Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for KOGENATE Bayer for bolus injection are: mean residence time [MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 ml/ h.
Mean baseline clearance for 14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 ml/ h corresponding to 3.0 ml/ h/ kg (range 1.6-4.6 ml/ h/ kg).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for KOGENATE Bayer in laboratory animals (mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog).
Specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species.
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of KOGENATE Bayer, since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of KOGENATE Bayer.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
74 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
75 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Reconstitute the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
76 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and patient should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table.

The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC-Code B02B D02.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII
78 binds to vWF in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Determination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor VIII.
The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs.
The degree and duration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of KOGENATE Bayer is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2% per IU/ kg body weight for KOGENATE Bayer.
This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma.
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours.
This is similar to that of plasma- derived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx.
13 hours.
Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for KOGENATE Bayer for bolus injection are: mean residence time [MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 ml/ h.
Mean baseline clearance for 14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 ml/ h corresponding to 3.0 ml/ h/ kg (range 1.6-4.6 ml/ h/ kg).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for KOGENATE Bayer in laboratory animals (mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog).
Specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species.
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of KOGENATE Bayer, since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of KOGENATE Bayer.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products.
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to the International Standard for factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma.
The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% to 2.5% of normal activity.
The required dosage is determined using the following formulae:
82 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy must be individualised according to the patient's needs (weight, severity of disorder of the haemostatic function, the site and extent of the bleeding, the titre of inhibitors, and the factor VIII level desired).
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required (%) (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be adapted according to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised in order to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency at which to repeat the infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in
83 their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
It has been shown in a clinical study performed with adult haemophilia A patients who undergo a major surgery that KOGENATE Bayer can be used for continuous infusion in surgeries (pre-, during and postoperative).
In this study heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
For the calculation of the initial infusion rate, clearance can be obtained by performing a pre-surgery decay curve, or by starting from an average population value (3.0-3.5 ml/ h/ Kg) and then adjust accordingly.
Infusion rate (in IU/ Kg/ h) = Clearance (in ml/ h/ Kg) x desired factor VIII level (in IU/ ml) For continuous infusion, clinical and in vitro stability has been demonstrated using ambulatory pumps with a PVC reservoir.
KOGENATE Bayer contains low level of polysorbate-80 as an excipient, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials.
This should be considered for a continuous infusion administration.
For scheduled prophylaxis against bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses of 20 to 60 IU of KOGENATE Bayer per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Data have been obtained in 61 children under 6 years of age.
Patients with inhibitors
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors.
If the expected plasma factor VIII activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.
If the inhibitor is present at levels less than 10 Bethesda Units (BU) per ml, administration of additional recombinant coagulation factor VIII may neutralise the inhibitor and permit continued clinically effective therapy with KOGENATE Bayer.
However, in the presence of an inhibitor the doses required are variable and must be adjusted according to clinical response and monitoring of plasma factor VIII activity.
In patients with inhibitor titres above 10 BU or with high anamnestic response, the use of (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) preparations has to be considered.
These therapies should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
Administration Reconstitute the preparation as described in section 6.6.
KOGENATE Bayer should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of injection:
2 ml/ min).
KOGENATE Bayer can be infused by continuous infusion.
The infusion rate should be calculated based on the clearance and the desired FVIII level.
Example: for a 75 kg patient with a clearance of 3 ml/ h/ kg, the initial infusion rate would be 3 IU/ h/ kg to achieve a FVIII level of 100%.
For calculation of ml/ hour, multiply infusion rate in IU/ h/ kg by kg bw/ concentration of solution (IU/ ml).
Clearance:
3 ml/ h/ kg
Desired plasma FVIII level
Infusion rate IU/ h/ kg
Infusion rate for 75 kg patient ml/ h Concentrations of rFVIII solution 100 IU/ ml 200 IU/ ml 400 IU/ ml
100% (1 IU/ ml) 60% (0.6 IU/ ml) 40% (0.4 IU/ ml)
3.0 1.8 1.2
2.25 1.125 0.56 1.35 0.68 0.34 0.9 0.45 0.225
Higher infusion rates may be required in conditions with accelerated clearance during major bleedings or extensive tissue damage during surgical interventions.
Subsequent infusion rates should be calculated based on the actual FVIII levels and recalculated clearance for each day post surgery based on the equation: clearance = infusion rate/ actual FVIII level.
84 4.3 Contraindications
Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
Patients should be made aware that the potential occurrence of chest tightness, dizziness, mild hypotension and nausea during infusion can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
Symptomatic treatment and therapy for hypersensitivity should be instituted as appropriate.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately and patient should contact their physician.
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed.
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are invariably IgG immunoglobulins directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Modified Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma.
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to anti- haemophilic factor VIII and to genetic factors among others, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days.
Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrence of inhibitors (low titre) have been observed after switching from one recombinant factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.
Patients treated with recombinant coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
See also section 4.8 Undesirable effects.
In a clinical study about the use of continuous infusion in surgeries, heparin was used to prevent thrombophlebitis at the infusion site as with any other long term intravenous infusions.
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium free”.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interactions of KOGENATE Bayer with other medicinal products are known.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with KOGENATE Bayer.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, KOGENATE Bayer should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive or use machines
KOGENATE Bayer has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer mild to moderate adverse events were observed in rare cases as presented in the following table.
85 MedDRA System Organ Class Blood and lymphatic sytem disorders Gastrointestinal disorders
MedDRA Preferred Term Factor VIII inhibition Dysgeusia Nausea
General disorders and administration site conditions Immune system disorders Investigations Nervous system disorders Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Injection site reaction Pyrexia Allergic / Anaphylactic reaction Blood pressure abnormal Dizziness Pruritus Rash
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
Patients should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC-Code B02B D02.
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions.
When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII
86 binds to vWF in the patient’ s circulation.
Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII: C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a results of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
Determination of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a conventional in vitro assay method for biological activity of factor VIII.
The aPTT is prolonged in all haemophiliacs.
The degree and duration of aPTT normalisation observed after administration of KOGENATE Bayer is similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The analysis of all recorded in vivo recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a mean rise of 2% per IU/ kg body weight for KOGENATE Bayer.
This result is similar to the reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma.
After administration of KOGENATE Bayer, peak factor VIII activity decreased by a two-phase exponential decay with a mean terminal half-life of about 15 hours.
This is similar to that of plasma- derived factor VIII which has a mean terminal half-life of approx.
13 hours.
Additional pharmacokinetic parameters for KOGENATE Bayer for bolus injection are: mean residence time [MRT (0-48)] of about 22 hours and clearance of about 160 ml/ h.
Mean baseline clearance for 14 adult patients undergoing major surgeries with continuous infusion are 188 ml/ h corresponding to 3.0 ml/ h/ kg (range 1.6-4.6 ml/ h/ kg).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Even doses several fold higher than the recommended clinical dose (related to body weight) failed to demonstrate any acute or subacute toxic effects for KOGENATE Bayer in laboratory animals (mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog).
Specific studies with repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, and carcinogenicity were not performed with octocog alfa due to the immune response to heterologous proteins in all non-human mammalian species.
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of KOGENATE Bayer, since no mutagenic potential could be detected in vitro or in vivo for the predecessor product of KOGENATE Bayer.

WHAT KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
One vial with powder for solution for injection nominally contains 250 IU octocog alfa (IU equals International Units).
After reconstitution with the appropriate volume of solvent (water for injections), each vial contains octocog alfa 100 IU/ ml.
Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII (ATC-Code B02B D02).
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU
Do not use KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to octocog alfa, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU.
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Take special care with KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU as there is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction).
If you experience tightness in the chest, feeling dizzy, feeling sick or faint, or experience dizziness on standing, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU.
If this occurs, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.
Your doctor may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate factor VIII levels.
If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU, consult your doctor immediately.
You may have developed factor VIII inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out
148 tests to confirm this.
Factor VIII inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which block the factor VIII you are using.
This makes factor VIII less effective in controlling bleeding.
If you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back.
Using other medicines Interactions with other medicines are not known.
However, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding consult your doctor before using this product.
Driving and using machines:
No effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been observed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU This medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.

Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster.
Holding the plunger in place, remove the syringe from the filter needle (the latter should remain attached to the vial).
Attach the syringe to the venipuncture set and ensure that no blood enters the syringe.
14.
15.
Remove tourniquet.
Inject the solution intravenously over several minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the needle.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort (maximum rate of infusion:
2 ml/ min).
16.
If a further dose needs to be administered, use a new syringe with product reconstituted as described above.
17.
If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe.
Hold a swab firmly over the injection site on the outstretched arm for approx.
2 minutes.
Finally, apply a small pressure dressing to the wound.
The amount of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of factor VIII inhibitors that you may have and the factor VIII level required.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood.
He will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below.
150 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/
Factor VIII level
Frequency of doses (hours)/
Type of surgical procedure
required (%) (IU/ dl)
Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
Your doctor should always adapt the amount of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU to be administered and the frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
If you are using KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.
This will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above, it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that
151 adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable.
If the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected.
By appropriate laboratory procedures, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor.
If you have the impression that the effect of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.
Patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of KOGENATE Bayer than previously to control a bleeding.
If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product, factor VIIa concentrate or (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.
Do not increase the dose of KOGENATE Bayer you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this.
These therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of infusion:
2 ml/ min).
Your doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is to be administered.
Usually, the substitution therapy with KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU is a life-time treatment.
If you use more KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU than you should:
No symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
If you have used more KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU than you should, please inform your doctor.
If you forget to use KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU: • Proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. • Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses.
If you stop using KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU Do not stop using KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In rare cases, you may notice any of the following side effects after administration of KOGENATE Bayer 250 IU: • rash/ itchy rash, local reactions at the injection site (e. g. burning sensation, temporary redness) • hypersensitivity reactions (e. g. tightness of the chest/ general feeling of being unwell, dizziness and nausea and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • unusual taste in the mouth • fever.
152 Furthermore, the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded.
If you notice any of the following symptoms during injection/ infusion: • chest tightness/ general feeling of being unwell • dizziness • mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • nausea this can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately.
Please consult your doctor immediately.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients.
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
You should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In rare cases, you may notice any of the following side effects after administration of KOGENATE Bayer 500 IU: • rash/ itchy rash, local reactions at the injection site (e. g. burning sensation, temporary redness) • hypersensitivity reactions (e. g. tightness of the chest/ general feeling of being unwell, dizziness and nausea and mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • unusual taste in the mouth • fever.
160 Furthermore, the possibility of an anaphylactic shock cannot be completely excluded.
If you notice any of the following symptoms during injection/ infusion: • chest tightness/ general feeling of being unwell • dizziness • mild hypotension (mildly reduced blood pressure, which may make you feel faint upon standing) • nausea this can constitute an early warning for hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions.
If allergic or anaphylactic reactions occur, the injection/ infusion should be stopped immediately.
Please consult your doctor immediately.
During studies, no patient developed clinically relevant antibody titres against the trace amounts of mouse protein and hamster protein present in the preparation.
However, the possibility of allergic reactions to constituents, e. g. trace amounts of mouse and hamster protein in the preparation exists in certain predisposed patients.
The formation of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors) is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
In studies with recombinant factor VIII preparations, development of inhibitors is predominantly observed in previously untreated haemophiliacs.
You should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests.
In clinical studies, KOGENATE Bayer has been used in the treatment of bleeding episodes in 37 previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 23 minimally treated pediatric patients (MTPs, defined as having equal to or less than 4 exposure days).
Five out of 37 (14%) PUP and 4 out of 23 (17%) MTP patients treated with KOGENATE Bayer developed inhibitors:
Overall 6 out of 60 (10%) with a titer above 10 BU and 3 out of 60 (5%) with a titer below 10 BU.
The median number of exposure days at the time of inhibitor detection in these patients was 9 days (range 3 - 18 days).
The median number of exposure days in the clinical studies was 114 (range:
4-478).
Four of the five patients, who had not achieved 20 exposure days at the end of the study, ultimately achieved more than 20 exposure days in post-study follow-up and one of them developed a low titer inhibitor.
The fifth patient was lost to follow-up.
In clinical studies with 73 previously treated patients (PTP, defined as having more than 100 exposure days), followed over four years, no de-novo inhibitors were observed.
In extensive post-registration studies with KOGENATE Bayer, involving more than 1000 patients the following was observed:
Less than 0.2% PTP developed de-novo inhibitors.
In a subset defined as having less than 20 exposure days at study entry, less than 11% developed de-novo inhibitors.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

Pharmacotherapeutic group: blood coagulation factor VIII (ATC-Code B02B D02).
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
This preparation does not contain von Willebrand factor and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand's disease.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU
Do not use KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to octocog alfa, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU.
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Take special care with KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU as there is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic reaction).
If you experience tightness in the chest, feeling dizzy, feeling sick or faint, or experience dizziness on standing, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction to KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU.
If this occurs, stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice.
Your doctor may wish to carry out tests to ensure that your current dose of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is sufficient to reach and maintain adequate factor VIII levels.
If your bleeding is not being controlled with KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU, consult your doctor immediately.
You may have developed factor VIII inhibitors and your doctor may wish to carry out
164 tests to confirm this.
Factor VIII inhibitors are antibodies in the blood which block the factor VIII you are using.
This makes factor VIII less effective in controlling bleeding.
If you have previously developed a factor VIII inhibitor and you switch factor VIII products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back.
Using other medicines Interactions with other medicines are not known.
However, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding consult your doctor before using this product.
Driving and using machines:
No effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been observed.
Important information about some of the ingredients of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU This medicinal product contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.

Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster.
Holding the plunger in place, remove the syringe from the filter needle (the latter should remain attached to the vial).
Attach the syringe to the venipuncture set and ensure that no blood enters the syringe.
14.
15.
Remove tourniquet.
Inject the solution intravenously over several minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the needle.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort (maximum rate of infusion:
2 ml/ min).
16.
If a further dose needs to be administered, use a new syringe with product reconstituted as described above.
17.
If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe.
Hold a swab firmly over the injection site on the outstretched arm for approx.
2 minutes.
Finally, apply a small pressure dressing to the wound.
The amount of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU you should use and how often you use it depends on many factors such as your weight, the severity of your haemophilia, the site and extent of bleeding, the amount of factor VIII inhibitors that you may have and the factor VIII level required.
Your doctor will calculate the dose of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU and how frequently you should use it to get the necessary level of factor VIII activity in your blood.
He will do this according to your particular needs using the formulae below.
166 I.
Required IU = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
II.
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =
2 x administered IU body weight (kg)
The following table provides a guide for factor VIII minimum blood levels.
In the case of the haemorrhagic events listed, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given level (in% of normal) in the corresponding period:
Degree of haemorrhage/
Factor VIII level
Frequency of doses (hours)/
Type of surgical procedure
required (%) (IU/ dl)
Duration of therapy (days)
Haemorrhage
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or oral bleed
20 - 40
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleed or haematoma
30 - 60
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and disability are resolved.
Life threatening bleeds such as intracranial bleed, throat bleed, severe abdominal bleed Surgery
60 - 100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved
Minor including tooth extraction
30 - 60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80 - 100 (pre- and
a) By bolus infusions Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours
postoperative)
until adequate wound healing occurs, then continue with therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30% to 60% b) By continuous infusion Raise factor VIII activity pre- surgery with an initial bolus infusion and immediately follow with continuous infusion (in IU/ Kg/ h) adjusting according to patient’ s daily clearance and desired factor VIII levels for at least 7 days.
Your doctor should always adapt the amount of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU to be administered and the frequency of administration according to the clinical effectiveness in your individual case.
Under certain circumstances larger amounts than those calculated may be required, especially in the case of the initial dose.
If you are using KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis), your doctor will calculate the dose for you.
This will usually be in the range of 20 to 60 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, administered at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
However, in some cases, especially younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Although dosage can be estimated by the calculations presented above, it is strongly recommended that appropriate laboratory tests be performed on your plasma at suitable intervals to ensure that
167 adequate factor VIII levels have been reached and are maintained.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, a precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis is indispensable.
If the factor VIII level of your plasma fails to reach expected levels, or if bleeding is not controlled after apparently adequate dosage, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors should be suspected.
By appropriate laboratory procedures, the presence of factor VIII inhibitors must be checked and quantified by an experienced doctor.
If you have the impression that the effect of KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor.
Patients with inhibitors If you have been informed by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you will possibly be required to use a larger amount of KOGENATE Bayer than previously to control a bleeding.
If this dose does not control your bleeding your doctor may consider the use of an additional product, factor VIIa concentrate or (activated) prothrombin complex concentrate.
Do not increase the dose of KOGENATE Bayer you use to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor.
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this.
These therapies should be directed by doctors with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level (maximal rate of infusion:
2 ml/ min).
Your doctor will tell you, how often and at what intervals KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is to be administered.
Usually, the substitution therapy with KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU is a life-time treatment.
If you use more KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU than you should:
No symptoms of overdosage with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.
If you have used more KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU than you should, please inform your doctor.
If you forget to use KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU: • Proceed with the next administration immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor. • Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten doses.
If you stop using KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU Do not stop using KOGENATE Bayer 1000 IU without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
