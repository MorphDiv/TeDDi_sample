EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
MABCAMPATH
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is MabCampath?
MabCampath is a concentrate that is made up into a solution for infusion (drip into a vein).
It contains the active substance alemtuzumab (10 mg/ ml or 30 mg/ ml).
What is MabCampath used for?
MabCampath is an anticancer medicine.
It is used to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), a cancer of the lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).
MabCampath is used in patients for whom treatment combinations including fludarabine (another medicine used in leukaemia) are not appropriate.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is MabCampath used?
MabCampath treatment should be supervised by a doctor experienced in the use of cancer treatments.
Patients should be given steroids, an antihistamine and a painkiller before the first dose and before any increase in dose.
They should also receive antibiotics and antiviral medicines during and after treatment.
MabCampath is given as an infusion lasting about two hours.
During the first week of treatment, MabCampath should be given in increasing doses:
3 mg on day 1, 10 mg on day 2 and 30 mg on day 3, as long as each dose is well tolerated.
This is called ‘ dose escalation’.
After this, the recommended dose is 30 mg a day, given three times a week (every other day) for a maximum of 12 weeks.
Patients should be monitored during treatment to see how they respond, but also to check their blood levels of platelets (the components that help clotting) and neutrophils (the white blood cells that fight infection): if these are too low the treatment should be interrupted or stopped.
See the Summary of Product Characteristics (also part of the EPAR) for full details.
How does MabCampath work?
The active substance in MabCampath, alemtuzumab, is a monoclonal antibody.
A monoclonal antibody is an antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure (called an antigen) that is found in certain cells in the body.
In CLL, too many lymphocytes are produced.
Alemtuzumab has been designed to bind to a glycoprotein (a protein that is coated with

As a result of this binding, the lymphocytes die, and this helps to control the CLL.
How has MabCampath been studied?
MabCampath has been examined in four main studies involving a total of 446 patients with CLL.
One study included 297 patients who had not received treatment before.
It compared the effectiveness of a 12-week course of MabCampath with that of a year-long course of chlorambucil (another anticancer medicine).
The main measure of effectiveness was how long it took until the disease got worse or the patient died.
The other three studies looked at a total of 149 patients who had already received other treatments.
In these studies, MabCampath was not compared with any other treatment.
The main study included 93 patients in whom previous treatment with fludarabine had stopped working.
The main measure of effectiveness was the overall response to treatment.
What benefit has MabCampath shown during the studies?
In patients who had not received treatment before, MabCampath was more effective than chlorambucil.
In the patients receiving MabCampath, it took an average of 14.6 months for the disease to get worse or for the patient to die, compared with 11.7 months in those taking chlorambucil.
In the main study of patients who had been treated before, 33% responded partially or completely to treatment with MabCampath.
Similar results were seen in the other two studies of previously treated patients.
What is the risk associated with MabCampath?
Side effects occur in about 97% of patients who have not been treated before and about 80% of those who have previously received treatment.
The most common side effects (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are infections, hypotension (low blood pressure), nausea (feeling sick), urticaria (hives), rash, fever, chills, low counts of blood cells (granulocytes, platelets and red blood cells), anorexia (loss of appetite), headache, dyspnoea (breathlessness), vomiting, diarrhoea, pruritus (itching), hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) and fatigue (tiredness).
For the full list of all side effects reported with MabCampath, see the Package Leaflet.
MabCampath should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to alemtuzumab, mouse proteins, or any of the other ingredients.
MabCampath must not be used in patients: • who have an active infection that has spread throughout the body; • with HIV infection; • who have active, secondary cancers; • who are pregnant.
Why has MabCampath been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that the effectiveness of MabCampath had been demonstrated, but that there is no information from studies directly comparing MabCampath with treatment combinations including fludarabine, which are widely used to treat patients with CLL.
Therefore, the Committee concluded that MabCampath’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with B-cell CLL for whom fludarabine combination chemotherapy is not appropriate.
The Committee recommended that MabCampath be given marketing authorisation.
MabCampath was originally authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’, because, for scientific reasons, it had not been possible to obtain complete information on the medicine.
As the company had supplied the additional information requested, the ‘ Exceptional Circumstances ’ ended on 04 July 2008.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of MabCampath?
The company that makes MabCampath will provide a brochure containing information on the medicine ’ s safety to all doctors in all Member States who prescribe the medicine.
