Returns:
TRUE on success, FALSE on error
sybase_close() closes the link to a Sybase database that's associated with the specified link identifier.
If the link identifier isn 't specified, the last opened link is assumed.
Note that this isn' t usually necessary, as non-persistent open links are automatically closed at the end of the script's execution.
sybase_close() will not close persistent links generated by sybase_pconnect().
See also: sybase_connect(), sybase_pconnect().
