EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
PRIALT
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Prialt?
Prialt is a solution for infusion containing the active substance ziconotide, at concentrations of 100 or 25 micrograms per millilitre.
What is Prialt used for?
Prialt is used to treat severe, chronic (long-term) pain in patients who need a painkiller by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord and the brain).
Because the number of patients who have chronic pain requiring intraspinal analgesia (painkilling drugs injected directly into the spine) is low, the disease is considered ‘ rare’, and Prialt was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 9 July 2001.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Prialt used?
Treatment with Prialt should only be carried out by a doctor who has experience in intrathecal dosing of medicines.
Prialt must be given as a very slow continuous infusion through an intrathecal catheter (a tube inserted into the spinal canal) using an infusion pump capable of delivering an accurate amount of the medicine.
Prialt may need to be diluted before use, especially with the lower doses needed at the start of treatment.
The starting dose of Prialt is 2.4 micrograms per day.
The dose may be increased at intervals of 1-2 days or more, to obtain the best balance between pain relief and possible side effects.
Most patients need doses lower than 9.6 micrograms per day.
The maximum daily dose is 21.6 micrograms per day.
Prialt is not recommended for children.
How does Prialt work?
The active substance in Prialt, ziconotide, is a copy of a natural substance, omega-conopeptide, extracted from the venom of a type of sea snail.
Ziconotide acts by attaching to special channels (calcium channels) on the surface of the nerve cells that transmit the pain signals.
By blocking the flow of calcium into the nerve cells, ziconotide interferes with the transmission of pain signals within the spine and this helps to bring relief from pain.
How has Prialt been studied?
The effects of Prialt were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
Prialt has been studied in 589 patients with severe chronic pain in 3 main studies and its effectiveness compared with that of placebo (a dummy treatment).
There were 2 short-term studies (5 and 6 days), 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

The third study looked at the use of the medicine over 3 weeks in adult patients with severe chronic pain.
In all studies, the main measure of effectiveness was the change in the Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI).
This is a score given by the patients of their pain on a scale from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (maximum pain)
What benefit has Prialt shown during the studies?
Prialt was more effective than placebo in the first 2 studies.
Before treatment, patients had VASPI scores between 74 and 80 mm.
After treatment, the scores in patients receiving Prialt were 35 mm (malignant pain) and 54 mm (non-malignant pain).
The scores in patients receiving placebo were 61 and 72 mm, respectively.
In the third study, there was a trend for Prialt to be more effective than placebo, with the VASPI score changing from 81 mm before treatment to 68 mm in patients receiving Prialt and to74 mm in patients receiving placebo.
What is the risk associated with Prialt?
The most common side effects (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are confusion, dizziness, nystagmus (uncontrolled eye movement), impaired memory (forgetfulness), headache, somnolence (sleepiness), blurred vision, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, abnormal gait (difficulty walking) and asthenia (weakness).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Prialt, see the Package Leaflet.
Prialt should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ziconotide or any of the other ingredients.
Prialt should not be used in patients at the same time as intrathecal chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs injected into the spinal canal).
Why has Prialt been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Prialt provides an alternative to other intrathecal painkillers, such as opioids.
They decided that Prialt’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of severe, chronic pain in patients who require intrathecal analgesia.
They recommended that Prialt be given marketing authorisation.
Prialt has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that because the disease is rare, it has not been possible to obtain complete information about Prialt.
Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary.
What information is still awaited for Prialt?
The company that makes Prialt is carrying out a study looking at the long term use of the medicine, looking in particular at the possibility of development of tolerance to treatment (when doses of a medicine that were effective become less effective over time).
Other information about Prialt:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Prialt on 21 February 2005.
The marketing authorisation holder is Eisai Limited.
The record of Prialt’ s designation as an orphan medicine is available here.
