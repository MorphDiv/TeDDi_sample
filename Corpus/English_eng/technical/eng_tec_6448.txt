Keyboard Layout Here you can choose your keyboard layout and model. The'model 'refers to the type of keyboard that is connected to your computer, while the keyboard layout defines "which key does what" and may be different for different countries.
Keyboard & model:
Here you can choose a keyboard model. This setting is independent of your keyboard layout and refers to the "hardware" model, i. e. the way your keyboard is manufactured. Modern keyboards that come with your computer usually have two extra keys and are referred to as "104-key" models, which is probably what you want if you do not know what kind of keyboard you have.
Available layouts:
...
Active layouts:
Command:
This is the command which will be executed to initialize configured layouts.
Layout variant:
Here you can choose a variant of selected keyboard layout. Layout variants usually represent different key maps for the same language. For example, Ukrainian layout might have four variants: basic, winkeys (as in Windows), typewriter (as in typewriters) and phonetic (each Ukrainian letter is placed on a transliterated latin one).
Label:
Switching Options
If you select "Application" or "Window" switching policy, changing the keyboard layout will only affect the current application or window.

Shortcuts for Switching Layout
Main shortcuts:
This is a shortcut for switching layouts which is handled by X. org. It allows modifier-only shortcuts.
3rd level shortcuts:
This is a shortcut for switching to a third level of the active layout (if it has one) which is handled by X. org. It allows modifier-only shortcuts.
Alternative shortcut:
This is a shortcut for switching layouts which is handled by KDE. It does not support modifier-only shortcuts and also may not work in some situations (e. g. if popup is active or from screensaver).
Advanced
& Reset old options
This is the command which will be executed to initialize configured options.
Your names
Your emails
Here you can set xkb extension options instead of, or in addition to, specifying them in the X11 configuration file.
Xkb Options
Add > >
< < Remove
This is the command which is executed when switching to the selected layout. It may help you if you want to debug layout switching, or if you want to switch layouts without the help of KDE.
Sticky Switching
If you have more than two layouts and turn this option on, switching with the keyboard shortcut or clicking on the kxkb indicator will only cycle through the last few layouts. You can specify the number of layouts to rotate below. You can still access all layouts by right-clicking on the kxkb indicator.

Layout name
Options
If more than one layout is present in this list, the KDE panel will offer a docked flag. By clicking on this flag you can easily switch between layouts. The first layout will be default one.
Keymap
This is the list of available keyboard layouts in your system. You can add a layout to the active list by selecting it and pressing "Add" button.
If you check this option, pressing and holding down a key emits the same character over and over again. For example, pressing and holding down the Tab key will have the same effect as that of pressing that key several times in succession: Tab characters continue to be emitted until you release the key.
& Enable keyboard repeat
& Delay:
If supported, this option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes. The'Repeat rate 'option controls the frequency of these keycodes.
& Rate:
If supported, this option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed.
If supported, this option allows you to setup the state of NumLock after KDE startup. You can configure NumLock to be turned on or off, or configure KDE not to set NumLock state.

Leave unchanged
Turn on
If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. This might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys, or if the sound that the keys make is very soft. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin box. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.
