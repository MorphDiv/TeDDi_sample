MCAL stands for Modular Calendar Access Library.
Libmcal is a C library for accessing calendars.
It 's written to be very modular, with pluggable drivers.
MCAL is the calendar equivalent of the IMAP module for mailboxes.
With mcal support, a calendar stream can be opened much like the mailbox stream with the IMAP support.
Calendars can be local file stores, remote ICAP servers, or other formats that are supported by the mcal library.
Calendar events can be pulled up, queried, and stored.
There is also support for calendar triggers (alarms) and recurring events.
With libmcal, central calendar servers can be accessed, removing the need for any specific database or local file programming.
Most of the functions use an internal event structure that is unique for each stream.
This alleviates the need to pass around large objects between functions.
There are convenience functions for setting, initializing, and retrieving the event structure values.
Note:
PHP had an ICAP extension previously, but the original library and the PHP extension is not supported anymore.
The suggested replacement is MCAL.
Note:
This extension is not available on Windows platforms.
This extension requires the mcal library to be installed.
Grab the latest version from http: / /mcal.chek.com / and compile and install it.
After you installed the mcal library, to get these functions to work, you have to compile PHP -with-mcal[ =DIR].
This extension has no configuration directives defined in php.ini.
This extension has no resource types defined.
The constants below are defined by this extension, and will only be available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.
