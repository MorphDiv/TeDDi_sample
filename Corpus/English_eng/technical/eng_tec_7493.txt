OCRFeeder Document Conversion System
Joaquim Rocha
jrocha@igalia.com
OCRFeeder is a document layout analysis and optical character recognition system.
OCRFeeder was created to allow users to easily convert document images (for example, a PNG image with text) into editable documents (for example, an ODT version with that text).
Given the images it will automatically outline its contents, perform OCR and distinguish between what's graphics and text. It generates multiple formats being its main one ODT.
This guide will explain you how to configure and use OCRFeeder.

Importing PDF
Some documents are nothing more than images placed in a PDF document. For cases like this,

Each PDF page will be converted to an image and placed in the pages' area.
The PDF conversion can be a demanding process and take some time for large PDF files.

Since just removing newlines in an hyphenized text would result in wrongly separated words, hyphenization is also detected and removed in this process.

A good window size should be slightly bigger than the text line spacing in an image.
Users may want to manually set this value if automatic one doesn't produce any valid content areas but normally it is easier to use the automatic one and perform any needed corrections directly in the content areas.

Automatic Recognition

After an image is added it can be automatically recognized by clicking
Since there are many different document layouts out there, the automatic recognition, mainly the page segmentation, may turn out not to be accurate for you document. In this case, some manual editing of the recognition results might be needed.
The automatic recognition performs some complex operations and may take some time depending on the size of the image and the complexity of the layout.
The automatic recognition will replace all the content areas in the currently selected page.
Adding an image to be recognized
Adding An Image
Adding an image to OCRFeeder is usually the first step when converting a document.
Each added image represents a page in the final document. A thumbnail of the image will be shown in the pages area (left area of
The order of the pages in the final document will be the same as the images' order in the pages' area. This way, pages can be reordered by dragging them in the images' thumbnails in the pages' area.
