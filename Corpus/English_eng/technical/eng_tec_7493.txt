Active substance:
Difloxacin (as hydrochloride)
100 mg
Excipients:
Benzyl alcohol
100 mg
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Oral solution
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Chickens (broilers and future breeders) Turkeys (young turkeys up to 2 kg body weight)
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
In chickens and turkeys:
Dicural oral solution is indicated for treatment of chronic respiratory infections caused by sensitive strains of Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma gallisepticum.
In turkeys:
Dicural oral solution is also indicated for the treatment of infections caused by Pasteurella multocida.
4.3 Contraindications
Since no studies were performed in clinically lame birds, Dicural should not be used in birds with existing leg-weakness or in birds suffering from osteoporosis.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals Heavy reliance on a single class of antibiotics may result in the induction of resistance in a bacterial population.
It is prudent to reserve the fluoroquinolones for the treatment of clinical conditions that have responded poorly, or are expected to respond poorly, to other classes of antibiotics.
Official and local antimicrobial policies should be taken into account when the product is used.
Whenever possible, fluoroquinolones should only be used based on susceptibility testing.
2/ 64 Use of the product deviating from the instructions given in the SPC may increase the prevalence of bacteria resistant to the fluoroquinolones and may decrease the effectiveness of treatment with other quinolones due to the potential for cross resistance.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals People with a known hypersensitivity to quinolones should avoid any contact with the product.
In order to avoid irritation of skin and/ or eyes, use gloves and a face-protecting device when handling this product.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
None known.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in birds in lay and/ or within 4 weeks before the onset of the laying period.
4.8 Interaction with other veterinary medicinal products and other forms of interaction
None known.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route.
Dicural oral solution must be administered daily in the drinking water in such a concentration that the dose is 10 mg/ kg bodyweight.
The administration must be continued for 5 days.
Taking into account the content of difloxacin in the oral solution (10%w/ v), the following calculation should be made to determine the volume (ml) to be added for each 1000 litres of water:
number of animals in the house X mean weight of individual animal (kg) X 100 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- total water consumption of the house on the previous day (litres)
The medicated drinking water should be prepared freshly each day.
No other source of drinking water should be available during the medication period.
At concentrations in the water of 0.03% (= 300 ml in 1000 litres) or greater, palatability for turkeys may be affected.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes)
Target animal safety studies in chickens and turkeys demonstrated that, when administered in drinking water at 30 mg/ kg (chickens) or 22 mg/ kg (turkeys) for three times the recommended duration (15 consecutive days), difloxacin hydrochloride appeared to be safe for the birds.
4.11 Withdrawal periods
Meat and offal (chickens and turkeys):
24 hours.
Not authorised for use in laying birds producing eggs for human consumption.
3/ 64 5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: general anti-infectives for systemic use; antibacterials for systemic use, quinolone antibacterials.
ATC vet code:
QJ01MA94
The fluoroquinolones exert their antibacterial effect against both replicating and non-replicating micro-organisms.
Difloxacin hydrochloride is bactericidal in activity and acts by inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase.
Strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma gallisepticum isolated from broilers and turkeys have been shown to be sensitive to difloxacin.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Difloxacin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration to reach steady state plasma concentrations in a few hours after initiation of medication.
Difloxacin is well distributed throughout the animal body, as was demonstrated by the tissue to plasma ratios.
Difloxacin concentrations equal to or greater than the MICs for the relevant pathogens are achieved in all relevant tissues and maintained for as long as medication is continued.
Chickens:
In chickens difloxacin is nearly completely absorbed after oral administration (approx.
96%).
It is well distributed in the body (Vd = 4.7 l/ kg) and has a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 7 hours.
Following continuous oral dosing with Dicural oral solution at 10 mg/ kg/ day for five consecutive days the mean difloxacin steady state plasma concentrations are approximately 200 ng/ ml.
Tissue to plasma ratios range from 0.6 (abdominal fat), 2.4 (lung), 4.5 (muscle) to 14.1 (liver).
Turkeys:
In turkeys difloxacin has a moderate oral bioavailability (approx.
58%).
It is very well distributed in the body (Vd = 9.9 l/ kg) and has a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 7 hours.
Following continuous oral dosing of Dicural oral solution at 10 mg/ kg/ day for five consecutive days the mean difloxacin steady state plasma concentrations are approximately 60 ng/ ml.
Tissue to plasma ratios range from 2.5 (abdominal fat), 3.7 (muscle), 4.8 (lung) to 36.5 (liver).
In both species difloxacin may be conjugated (glucuronidated or sulphated), desmethylated into sarafloxacin or oxidised into N-oxide-difloxacin.
The main metabolites are hydrolysable conjugates of difloxacin, the other metabolites are proportionally minor ones.

It is prudent to reserve the fluoroquinolones for the treatment of clinical conditions that have responded poorly, or are expected to respond poorly, to other classes of antibiotic.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals.
People with a known hypersensitivity to quinolones should avoid any contact with the product.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Adverse reactions were rare in dogs treated with difloxacin.
The observed reactions were inappetence, emesis, diarrhoea and anal irritation.
These adverse reactions were self-limiting within one or two days and did not require additional treatment.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The reproductive safety of the veterinary medicinal product has only been evaluated in laboratory animals, the use of difloxacin in pregnant or lactating bitches or male stud dogs is therefore not recommended.
4.8 Interaction with other veterinary medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The use of fluoroquinolones in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may cause seizures.
Antacids may interfere with gastro-intestinal absorption.
Nitrofurantoin may impair quinolone efficacy if used concurrently in the treatment of urinary tract infections.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
The recommended dose of difloxacin is 5 mg/ kg bodyweight per day.
Dicural coated tablets should be given once a day for at least 5 days.
Superficial pyoderma may require treatment for up to a maximum of 21 days.
The tablets should be administered for at least 2 days beyond the cessation of clinical signs.
Therapy should be re-evaluated if no improvement is seen within 5 days, or 10 days in the case of superficial pyoderma.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes)
Dogs treated orally with difloxacin (as hydrochloride) at 10 times the recommended dose for 10 days occasionally showed mild adverse reactions such as orange/ yellowing discoloration of the faeces, emesis and hypersalivation.
Histopathological changes were noted in the articular cartilage of weight bearing joints of young (3.5 months old) beagle dogs after the oral administration of difloxacin at doses of greater than 5 mg/ kg/ day for 90 days.
No specific antidotes for difloxacin (or other quinolones) are known, therefore, in case of overdose symptomatic treatment should be given.
8/ 64 4.11 Withdrawal period
Not applicable.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: general anti-infectives for systemic use; antibacterials for systemic use, quinolone antibacterials.
ATC vet code:
QJ01MA94
Difloxacin is an aryl-fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity.
Difloxacin can be bactericidal against many Gram-negative micro-organisms and a selection of Gram-positive micro- organisms.
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
The fluoroquinolones exert their antibacterial effects against both replicating and dormant micro- organisms.
Difloxacin acts primarily through inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase.
The following organisms were tested and found to be susceptible to difloxacin in vitro:
Escherichia coli Klebsiella spp.
Pasteurella spp.
Pseudomonas spp.
Staphylococcus intermedius
The following organisms were found to be of intermediate susceptibility:
Proteus spp.
Staphylococcus spp.
Streptococcus canis (beta) Streptococcus spp.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following an oral dose (a plain tablet) in dogs of 5 mg/ kg bodyweight, difloxacin reached its average peak plasma concentration of 1.8 µg/ ml in approximately 3 hours.
Approximately 95% of the oral dose was absorbed.
The elimination half-life averaged 9.3 hours.
Long term daily oral treatment over 180 days at 5 mg/ kg bodyweight did not influence difloxacin kinetics, neither by accumulation nor by increased drug metabolism.

Taking into account the content of difloxacin in the oral solution (10%w/ v), the following calculation should be made to determine the volume (ml) to be added for each 1000 litres of water:
number of animals in the house X mean weight of individual animal (kg) X 100 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- total water consumption of the house on the previous day (litres)

OTHER INFORMATION
For animal treatment only - to be supplied only on veterinary prescription.
Dicural Coated Tablets consist of a core tablet containing difloxacin hydrochloride and a highly palatable coating.
Each strength of the product is available in packs of 10, 20 and 100 tablets.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
Difloxacin is an aryl-fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity.
Difloxacin can be bactericidal against many Gram-negative micro-organisms and a selection of Gram-positive micro- organisms.
The fluoroquinolones exert their antibacterial effects against both replicating and dormant micro- organisms.
Difloxacin acts primarily through inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase.
The following organisms were tested and found to be susceptible to difloxacin in vitro:
Escherichia coli Klebsiella spp.
Pasteurella spp.
Pseudomonas spp.
Staphylococcus intermedius
The following organisms were found to be of intermediate susceptibility:
Proteus spp.
Staphylococcus spp.
Streptococcus canis (beta) Streptococcus spp.
Following an oral dose (a plain tablet) in dogs of 5 mg/ kg bodyweight, difloxacin reached its average peak plasma concentration of 1.8 µg/ ml in approximately 3 hours.
Approximately 95% of the oral dose was absorbed.
The elimination half-life averaged 9.3 hours.
50/ 64 Long term daily oral treatment over 180 days at 5 mg/ kg bodyweight did not influence difloxacin kinetics, neither by accumulation nor by increased drug metabolism.

Overdosage may also give rise to oedema and swelling in the knee joints.
Dogs:
In dogs the oral administration of difloxacin at up to 5 times the recommended dose rate for 30 days did not result in any adverse reactions.
In another study dogs treated orally with difloxacin at 10 times the recommended dose for 10 days showed occasionally mild adverse reactions such as orange/ yellowing discoloration of the faeces, emesis and hypersalivation.
No specific antidotes for difloxacin (or other quinolones) are known, therefore in case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be given
