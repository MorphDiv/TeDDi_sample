This screen is useful for getting specific information about your X server and the current session of X.
When you open this module, you are presented with some information. The left hand side of the window is organized into a tree. Some of the elements have a plus sign in front of the label. Clicking this sign opens a submenu related to the label. Clicking on a minus sign in front of a label hides the submenu.
The right hand side of the window contains the individual values for each of the parameters on the left.
The information presented will vary depending on your setup.
Some setups may not be able to determine some or all of the parameters.
You can not change any values from this menu. It is for information only.
