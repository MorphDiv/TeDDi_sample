Introduction
& umbrello; is a & UML; diagram tool that can support you in the software development process. Especially during the analysis and design phases of this process, & umbrello; will help you to get a high quality product. & UML; can also be used to document your software designs to help you and your fellow developers.
Having a good model of your software is the best way to communicate with other developers working on the project and with your customers. A good model is extremely important for medium and big-size projects, but it is also very useful for small ones. Even if you are working on a small one man project you will benefit from a good model because it will give you an overview that will help you code things right the first time.
& UML; is the diagramming language used to describing such models. You can represent your ideas in & UML; using different types of diagrams. & umbrello; 1.2 supports the following types:
Class Diagram
Sequence Diagram
Collaboration Diagram
Use Case Diagram
State Diagram
Activity Diagram
Component Diagram
Deployment Diagram
More information about & UML; can be found at the website of OMG, http: / /www. omg. org who create the & UML; standard.
We hope you enjoy & umbrello; and that it helps you create high quality software. & umbrello; is Free Software and available at no cost, the only thing we ask from you is to report any bugs, problems, or suggestions to the & umbrello; developers at uml-devel@lists. sourceforge. net or http: / /bugs. kde. org.
