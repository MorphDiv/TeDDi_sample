Managing your Certificates
If you are using Microsoft Windows, you can manage your certificates from the Control Panel applet &quot; Internet Options &quot; on the &quot; Contents &quot; tab page.
Import your new root certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities list.
If you are using Solaris or Linux, you must install a recent version of Thunderbird, Mozilla Suite, or Firefox software to install some system files that are needed for encryption.
If you have created different profiles in Thunderbird, Mozilla, or Firefox, and you want %PRODUCTNAME to use one specified profile for certificates, then you can set the environment variable MOZILLA_CERTIFICATE_FOLDER to point to the folder of that specified profile.
Open your Web browser's preferences dialogue box, select the Privacy & Security tab page, click on Certificates - Manage Certificates.
Import your new root certificate, then select and edit the certificate.
Enable the root certificate to be trusted at least for web and email access.
This ensures that the certificate can sign your documents.
You may edit any intermediate certificate in the same way, but it is not mandatory for signing documents.
When you have edited the new certificates, restart %PRODUCTNAME.

The result of the signature validation is displayed in the status bar and within the Digital Signature dialogue box.
Several documents and macro signatures can exist inside an ODF document.
If there is a problem with one signature, then the validation result of that one signature is assumed for all signatures.
That is, if there are ten valid signatures and one invalid signature, then the status bar and the status field in the dialogue box will flag the signature as invalid.
Signing the macros inside a document
Normally, macros are part of a document.
If you sign a document, the macros inside the document are signed automatically.
If you want to sign only the macros, but not the document, proceed as follows:
Tools - Macros - Digital Signature
