ERROR __call__ error with %(method)s %(path)s
No super_admin_key set in conf file! Exiting.
THERE ARE ACCOUNTS IN YOUR auth.db THAT DO NOT BEGIN WITH YOUR NEW RESELLER
PREFIX OF "%(reseller)s".
YOU HAVE A FEW OPTIONS:
 1. RUN "swift-auth-update-reseller-prefixes %(db_file)s %(reseller)s",
 "swift-init auth-server restart", AND
 "swift-auth-recreate-accounts -K ..." TO CREATE FRESH ACCOUNTS.
 OR
 2. REMOVE %(db_file)s, RUN "swift-init auth-server restart", AND RUN
 "swift-auth-add-user ..." TO CREATE BRAND NEW ACCOUNTS THAT WAY.
 OR
 3. ADD "reseller_prefix = %(previous)s" (WITHOUT THE QUOTES) TO YOUR
 proxy-server.conf IN THE [filter:auth] SECTION AND TO YOUR
 auth-server.conf IN THE [app:auth-server] SECTION AND RUN
 "swift-init proxy-server restart" AND "swift-init auth-server restart"
 TO REVERT BACK TO YOUR PREVIOUS RESELLER PREFIX.

 %(note)s
SINCE YOUR PREVIOUS RESELLER PREFIX WAS AN EMPTY STRING, IT IS NOT
 RECOMMENDED TO PERFORM OPTION 3 AS THAT WOULD MAKE SUPPORTING MULTIPLE
 RESELLERS MORE DIFFICULT.
