Organizing your photos
Import
You can import photos from your hard drive or your camera. When you import your photos into F-Spot from your camera, it will always make a copy of them, leaving you free to clear your camera's memory. By default, F-Spot will make a copy of photos imported from your hard drive. Uncheck the
By default, F-Spot copies your photos to the
If there is a tiny chance that some of your photos are already imported from the chosen source, you can use
If all the photos you are importing at one time are from a particular event, or have some other characteristic in common, you can create a tag for them so you can later find them with ease. To do this, follow the instructions from
F-Spot uses a database stored at
After an import, F-Spot will display the pictures of the latest import roll only. Read
You can also import directly from Mozilla
Edit
If you double click or press enter on an image, you enter Edit mode, where you can remove red-eye, crop, and adjust brightness and colors.
Versions
When you edit your photos, a new copy (called a version) is created, so your original is never altered. After your first edit to a photo, subsequent edits will modify the same version. If you want to create multiple versions of your photo, perhaps with different cropping or coloring, you can do so via the
Crop
Cropping an image is a great way to improve the quality of a photograph by change how it is framed. You crop a photo by selecting the part of the photo you want to keep. If you want your photo to be the exact dimensions necessary for a certain print size, you can constrain the kind of selection F-Spot will allow you to draw by choosing the appropriate size from the constraint drop down. See the
Crop tool
Once you have made your crop selection, you must click the crop button beneath the image to finalize the crop. If you are working with the original photo, cropping creates a new version your photo.
Straighten
Straighten effect is a tool to level a photo, quite helpful for landscapes taken without a tripod, when (imaginary) line of horizon is not at 0°. This tool rotates an image by a specified angle and automagically crops the resulted image, so that you always see a perfect rectangle.
Straighten tool
Adjust Colors
To adjust the brightness, contrast, and colors of a photo, first click the
Adjust Colors tool
AutoColor
This effect automatically adjusts color levels to make a pretty balanced picture color-wise. It serves best for pictures taken with automatical white balance, when camera didn't manage to do the job well.
Desaturate
To make a colorful photo a black and white one, open a photo of choice and press
Desaturation tool
Sepia
To make a colorful photo look like an old-style picture in sepia tones, open a photo of choice and press
Remove Red-Eye
To remove redeye from a photo, you need to select a zone containing the eyes. You may want to zoom in on the image to accurately select the eyes in the photo. You should be able to correct both eyes on the same person in one shot, or even the eyes from multiple people at once. If this doesn't work for you, or the selected zone contains some vivid red parts (lips, ...) you'll probably have to correct one red eye at a time.
To make your selection, click one corner of the rectangle that will be your selection, and drag your mouse to the diagonal corner and release it. You can resize your selection by dragging its edges, and you can move it by clicking in the middle of it and dragging it to where you want it.
Once you have selected a zone, you can remove the red from it by clicking the red-eye button beneath the photo.
Red-Eye tool
You can change the threshold for redeyes detection by changing the gconf key
Soft Focus
In photography sharpening one region of a picture, while blurring all the rest, is a way to make an emphasis and grab attention. It is achieved by using a lens that allows shooting with a short distance in front of and beyond the subject that appears to be in focus. Soft focus effect is a way to emulate such a lens.
Soft Focus tool
Click to choose central point of the area you want to be in focus and adjust amount of blurring, then click
Sharpen
Out-of-focus photographs and most digitized images often need a sharpness correction. The Unsharp Mask effect sharpens edges of the elements without increasing noise or blemish. To sharpen a photo choose



Describe
You can also enter a description of the image by clicking on the text entry box below the image and typing.
Adjust Time
In both 'browse' or 'edit' modes, you can adjust the time of one or multiple pictures (
Tag
F-Spot enables you to organize and enjoy your photos by associating them with various user-customizable tags. A tag is a merely a label. F-Spot comes with default tags to get you started; you are free to change them and add new ones. For example, if you want to create a tag for specific event, you can create a new tag named after that event under the Events tag.
There are many ways to tag photos:
drag and drop the photo(s) onto the tag
drag and drop the tag onto the photo(s)
via the photo's right-click menu
via the Tags and Edit menus
by typing them in. Press
You can also use auto-completion in this entry bar: After entering the beginning of a tag name, press
The first photo you associate with a tag will be used for that tag's icon. You can always edit a tag's name, parent tag, and icon by right clicking on it and choosing
You can change a tag's parent by dragging and dropping it where you like. Also, you can edit the name of a tag by selecting it and pressing
You can also change size of tag icons in the sidebar or even make tag icons invisible by selecting preferred option from
F-Spot can write tags as metadata fields into JPEG files. Tags for various RAW files, PNG, TIFF, and others are written to F-Spot's database. You will have to re-tag these files if you re-import your collection.
Enjoying your photos
Browse
You can use the slider widget to browse your photos by month or by directory. To change this setting, go to
Search
F-Spot uses search filters to help you better define search criteria.
Tags
You can start a search by double clicking or activating a tag from the tag list. Alternatively, you can show the find bar with
To find photos that are tagged with both of two tags, activate the first in the tag view or drag it onto the find bar, then drag the second tag and drop it on top of the first. You can also right click on the second tag in the tag view, or use the
You can drag a tag icon around on the find bar to change from finding it and another tag to finding it or another tag.
You can search for photos that do not have a particular tag by double-clicking on a tag in the find bar. Alternatively, you can right-click a tag in the find bar and select

Import Rolls
F-Spot remembers what pictures were imported every now and then. Use



Every time you change settings of the filter, the amount of selected photos will appear in the bottom part of the dialog.
When you apply Import Roll filter, in the Find bar you will see
If you don't need the Import Roll filter anymore, choose
The number of displayed rolls in the dialog is defined by the gconf key
Type-to-find
There is also a type-to-find entry. Press
This function will also search for the typed text into photos comments and filename.
Fullscreen Mode and Slideshows
For fewer distractions and larger display, you can view your photos in full screen mode. You control when to show the next photo or to return to the previous. Enter fullscreen mode by pressing
FullScreen
In slideshow mode, you can sit back and view your photos as they are presented to you. You can start a slideshow by pressing the button on the toolbar.

Color management
What's color management
When you capture a photo and look at it on a display, it looks different than on a camera's preview display or on any other display. It will also look different when you print it. This is because every device has unique color reproduction capabilities.
Color management system (CMS) is a tool to achieve reliable color reproduction for both display and output (e.g. a printer). A CMS relies on color profiles to map original colors to the color that a device can reproduce so that colors will appear the same way everywhere — on a computer LCD monitor, on a print from your local photolab etc.
What's a color profile
A color profile is a file with either .icc (thus its is often called an ICC profile) or .icm extension that describes how device's colors correspond to a universal description of colors.
There are several types of profiles:
Input device profile. It's profile for a camera or a profile that an application like XSane embeds into a scanned image.
Working space profile. It's a profile that describes color space in which all operations are done inside an application. Usually very wide gamut profiles like AdobeRGB1998 or ProPhotoRGB are used for that.
Display profile. It's a profile for a monitor.
Output profile. This is usually a profile for you printer.
Currently F-Spot allows setting only display and output profiles. All color operations are done in sRGB color space.
How to get my screen/printer color profile
There are few ways to get a color profile.
From CD or Internet
Many hardware manufacturers put color profiles into CD in the bundle. If you have one (from monitor or printer), you can use it. Or you can download it from the Internet (usually, from support section of the manufacturer's web site). Some camera manufacturers (Nikon, Canon) also provide ICC profiles.
Calibrating and profiling
Best results can be achieved by calibrating and profiling devices with a measurement device. It is not so difficult, but it means that you need a spectrophotometer to do all measurements and create an ICC profile.
If you are on Windows or Mac OS X, you can use manufacturer's software coming with a spectrophotometer. On Linux you will have to use either
Please refer to documentation of third party hardware and software vendors for details.
Embedding
Image formats themselves (such as TIFF, JPEG, PNG...) may contain embedded color profiles. If color management is enabled, F-Spot looks for such embedded profiles and takes them into consideration.
How to use color management in F-Spot
Color management in F-Spot can use only RGB profiles at this time (and you can't see other profiles in the F-Spot).
Copy your color profiles into the

Extend functionality
What extensions are
F-Spot extensions are means to add new functionality to the application. F-Spot supports two types of extension: exporters (which allow exporting photos to new web services or data storages) and tools (which allow new ways of color correction, duplicate photos finders etc.). Extensions are distributed in form of extension packages.
In the best traditions of not reinventing the wheel extensions can use other extensions, which means that one extension cannot work, if another extension is not installed. This concept of dependance actually means that
you cannot install an extension, if the extension it depends on, is not present in the system
you cannot remove an extension on which some other extension depends
Managing extensions
To manage extensions choose
Managing extension repositories
Simply put, repositories are extension storages. They can be either network or local. To add a new repository click Repositories button, choose type of the repository you are about to add and provide either URL or path. If the URL or path you specified doesn't contain a description (index) file for extensions, a warning message will pop up to tell you that.
To remove a repository click
