tags
between the HEAD tags of the exported document.
META tags are not displayed in a Web browser, and are used to include information, such as keywords for search engines on your Web page.
To set the properties of the current document, choose
File - Properties
, click the
Description
or
User-defined
tabs, and then type the information you want.
The following file properties are converted to META tags when you export a file as an HTML document:
File Property
< TITLE >
Subject
< META NAME= &quot; CLASSIFICATION &quot; CONTENT= &quot; Field Content &quot; >
Keywords
< META NAME= &quot; KEYWORDS &quot; CONTENT= &quot; Field Content &quot; >
Description
< META NAME= &quot; DESCRIPTION &quot; CONTENT= &quot; Field Content &quot; >
Info fields 1...4
< META NAME= &quot; Info field name &quot; CONTENT= &quot; Field Content &quot; >
When you import an HTML containing these META tags, the contents of the tags are added to the corresponding $[officename] file property box.
Keywords must be separated by commas.
A keyword can contain white space characters or semicolons.
Import Tips
When you import an HTML document, following META tags are automatically converted to $[officename] fields: < META HTTP-EQUIV= &quot; REFRESH &quot; ... > and < META NAME= &quot; ... &quot; ... > , where NAME equals to AUTHOR, CREATED, CHANGED, CHANGEDBY, DESCRIPTION, KEYWORDS or CLASSIFICATION.
Scripts, comments, and META tags that are positioned directly before a TABLE tag are inserted in the first cell of the table.
Scripts and META tags in the header of an HTML document are imported and anchored to the first paragraph in the document.
Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility
.
A known META tag contains either &quot; HTTP-EQUIV &quot; or &quot; NAME &quot; , and are imported as $[officename] comments.
The only exception is < META NAME= &quot; GENERATOR &quot; ... > , which is ignored.
Export Tips
Comments and script fields at the beginning of the first paragraph in a document are exported to the header of an HTML document.
If the document begins with a table, the first paragraph in the first cell of the table is exported to the header of the HTML document.
