PHP Manual

(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Outputs a large amount of information about the current state of PHP.
This includes information about PHP compilation options and extensions, the PHP version, server information and environment (if compiled as a module), the PHP environment, OS version information, paths, master and local values of configuration options, HTTP headers, and the PHP License.
Because every system is setup differently, phpinfo() is commonly used to check configuration settings and for available predefined variables on a given system.
Also, phpinfo() is a valuable debugging tool as it contains all EGPCS (Environment, GET, POST, Cookie, Server) data.
The output may be customized by passing one or more of the following constants bitwise values summed together in the optional what parameter.
One can also combine the respective constants or bitwise values together with the or operator.
