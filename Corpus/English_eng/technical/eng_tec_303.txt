WEEKNUM

WEEKNUM function
WEEKNUM
WEEKNUM calculates the week number of the year for the internal date value.
The International Standard ISO 8601 has decreed that Monday shall be the first day of the week.
A week that lies partly in one year and partly in another is assigned a number in the year in which most of its days lie.
That means that week number 1 of any year is the week that contains 4th January.
Syntax:
WEEKNUM(Number; Mode)
Number
is the internal date number.
Mode
sets the start of the week and the calculation type.
1 = Sunday
2 = Monday
Examples:
=WEEKNUM( &quot; 01/01/1995 &quot; ; 1) returns 1 (01/01/1995 was a Sunday)
=WEEKNUM( &quot; 01/01/1995 &quot; ; 2) returns 52.
If the week starts on Monday, Sunday belongs to the last week of the previous year.
