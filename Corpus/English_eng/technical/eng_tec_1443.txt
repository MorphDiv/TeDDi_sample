Creating Animated GIF Images
You can animate drawing objects, text objects, and graphic objects (images) on your slides to make your presentation more interesting. $[officename] Impress provides you with a simple animation editor with which you can create animation images (frames) by assembling objects from your slide.
The animation effect is achieved by rotating through the static frames that you create.
If you create a bitmap animation (animated GIF), you can assign a delay time to each frame, and specify the number of times the animation is played.
To create an animated GIF:
Insert - Animated Image
.
Do one of the following:
Apply Object
button
Note Icon
to add a single object or a group of objects to the current animation frame.
Apply Objects Individually
button
Tip Icon
to create a separate animation frame for each of the selected objects.
Animation Group
area, select
Bitmap object
.
Use the animation timeline to specify the duration for displaying a frame and the number of times an animation sequence is presented (looping).
Image Number

box (middle box).
Repeat the last two steps for each frame in your animation.
