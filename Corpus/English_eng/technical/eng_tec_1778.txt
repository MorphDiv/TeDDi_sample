Cos function
Cos Function [Run-time]
Calculates the cosine of an angle.
The angle is specified in radians.
The result lies in the range -1 to +1.
Using the angle Alpha, the Cos Function calculates the ratio of the length of the side that is adjacent to the angle, divided by the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.
Cos(Alpha) = Adjacent/Hypotenuse
Syntax:
Cos (Number)
Return value:
Double
Parameters:
Number:
Numerical expression that specifies an angle in radians for which you want to calculate the cosine.
To convert degrees to radians, multiply degrees by Pi/180.
To convert radians to degrees, multiply radians by 180/Pi.
degree=(radian*180)/Pi
radian=(degree*Pi)/180
Pi is here the fixed circle constant with the rounded value 3.1415926...
Example:
REM The following example allows for a right-angled triangle the input of
REM secant and angle (in degrees) and calculates the length of the hypotenuse:
Sub ExampleCosine
REM rounded Pi = 3.1415926...
Dim d1 as Double, dAngle as Double
d1 = InputBox$ ( &quot; &quot; Enter the length of the adjacent side: &quot; , &quot; Adjacent &quot; )
dAngle = InputBox$ ( &quot; Enter the angle Alpha (in degrees): &quot; , &quot; Alpha &quot; )
Print &quot; The length of the hypothenuse is &quot; ; (d1 / cos (dAngle * Pi / 180))
End Sub
