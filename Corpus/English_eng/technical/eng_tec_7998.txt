4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D insufficiency.
FOSAVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dosage is one FOSAVANCE tablet once weekly.
Due to the nature of the disease process in osteoporosis, FOSAVANCE is intended for long-term use.
To permit adequate absorption of alendronate:
FOSAVANCE must be taken with water only (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medicinal product (including antacids, calcium supplements and vitamins) of the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), food and some medicinal products are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following instructions should be followed exactly in order to minimize the risk of oesophageal irritation and related adverse reactions (see section 4.4):
• FOSAVANCE should only be swallowed after getting up for the day with a full glass of water (not less than 200ml or 7fl. oz.).
• Patients should not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to dissolve in their mouths because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.
• Patients should not lie down until after their first food of the day which should be at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
• Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking FOSAVANCE.
2 • FOSAVANCE should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day.
Patients should receive supplemental calcium if intake from diet is inadequate (see section 4.4).
Additional supplementation with vitamin D should be considered on an individual basis taking into account any vitamin D intake from vitamins and dietary supplements.
The equivalence of intake of 2800 IU of vitamin D3 weekly in FOSAVANCE to daily dosing of vitamin D 400 IU has not been studied.
Use in the elderly:
In clinical studies there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profiles of alendronate.
Therefore no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly.
Use in renal impairment:
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35ml/ min.
FOSAVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment where GFR is less than 35ml/ min, due to lack of experience.
Use in children and adolescents:
FOSAVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and therefore should not be given to them.
4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.
• Abnormalities of the oesophagus and other factors which delay oesophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia.
• Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
• Hypocalcaemia.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Alendronate Alendronate can cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa.
Because there is a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when alendronate is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dysphagia, oesophageal disease, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with a recent history (within the previous year) of major gastrointestinal disease such as peptic ulcer, or active gastrointestinal bleeding, or surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions (sometimes severe and requiring hospitalisation), such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, rarely followed by oesophageal stricture, have been reported in patients receiving alendronate.
Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signalling a possible oesophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue alendronate and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain on swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be greater in patients who fail to take alendronate properly and/ or who continue to take alendronate after developing symptoms suggestive of oesophageal irritation.
It is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and are understood by the patient (see section 4.2).
Patients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase their risk of oesophageal problems.
3 While no increased risk was observed in extensive clinical trials with alendronate, there have been rare (post-marketing) reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers, some of which were severe and with complications (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis of the jaw, generally associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in patients with cancer who are receiving treatment regimens including primarily intravenously administered bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in patients with osteoporosis receiving oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease).
While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible.
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition.
For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
Clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment.
Bone, joint, and/ or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates.
In post-marketing experience, these symptoms have rarely been severe and/ or incapacitating (see section 4.8).
The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment.
Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment.
A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same medicinal product or another bisphosphonate.
Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of FOSAVANCE they should take one tablet on the morning after they remember.
They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.
FOSAVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment where GFR is less than 35ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Causes of osteoporosis other than oestrogen deficiency and ageing should be considered.
Hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with FOSAVANCE (see section 4.3).
Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be effectively treated before starting FOSAVANCE.
The content of vitamin D in FOSAVANCE is not suitable for correction of vitamin D deficiency.
In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored during therapy with FOSAVANCE.
Due to the positive effects of alendronate in increasing bone mineral, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
These are usually small and asymptomatic.
However, there have been rare reports of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, which have occasionally been severe and often occurred in patients with predisposing conditions (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the magnitude of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with disease associated with unregulated overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
Urine and serum calcium should be monitored in these patients.
Patients with malabsorption may not adequately absorb vitamin D3.
4 Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Alendronate If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate.
Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products are anticipated.
A number of patients in the clinical trials received oestrogen (intravaginal, transdermal, or oral) while taking alendronate.
No adverse reactions attributable to their concomitant use were identified.
Although specific interaction studies were not performed, in clinical studies alendronate was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed medicinal products without evidence of interactions of clinical relevance.
Colecalciferol Olestra, mineral oils, orlistat, and bile acid sequestrants (e. g. cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides may increase the catabolism of vitamin D.
Additional vitamin D supplements may be considered on an individual basis.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
FOSAVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and therefore it should not be used during pregnancy or in breast-feeding women.
There are no adequate data from the use of FOSAVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, or postnatal development.
Alendronate given during pregnancy in rats caused dystocia related to hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Studies in animals have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity with high doses of vitamin D (see section 5.3).
It is not known whether alendronate is excreted into human breast milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, there is no information to indicate that FOSAVANCE affects a patient’ s ability to drive or operate machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies and/ or post-marketing use with alendronate.
No additional adverse reactions have been identified for FOSAVANCE.
[Common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000, < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1000), very rare (< 1/ 10,000)]

Rare: hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria and angioedema
During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency not known):
Nervous system disorders:
dizziness
Ear and labyrinth disorders:
vertigo
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:
alopecia
Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders:
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated by bisphosphonates.
The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients, but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is generally associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Diagnosis of cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also deemed as risk factors (see section 4.4); joint swelling.
General disorders and administration site conditions:
asthenia, peripheral oedema
Laboratory test findings In clinical studies, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking alendronate 10 mg/ day versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to < 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to ≤ 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) were similar in both treatment groups.
6 4.9 Overdose
Alendronate Hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as upset stomach, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer, may result from oral overdose.
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with alendronate.
In case of overdose with FOSAVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.
Owing to the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright.
Colecalciferol Vitamin D toxicity has not been documented during chronic therapy in generally healthy adults at a dose less than 10,000 IU/ day.
In a clinical study of healthy adults a 4000 IU daily dose of vitamin D3 for up to five months was not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1.
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Bisphosphonates, combinations, ATC code:
M05BB03.
FOSAVANCE is a combination tablet containing the two active substances alendronate sodium trihydrate and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies have shown preferential localisation of alendronate to sites of active resorption.
Activity of osteoclasts is inhibited, but recruitment or attachment of osteoclasts is not affected.
The bone formed during treatment with alendronate is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 by ultraviolet light.
In the absence of adequate sunlight exposure, vitamin D3 is an essential dietary nutrient.
Vitamin D3 is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver, and stored until needed.
Conversion to the active calcium-mobilizing hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is tightly regulated.
The principal action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of both calcium and phosphate as well as regulate serum calcium, renal calcium and phosphate excretion, bone formation and bone resorption.
Vitamin D3 is required for normal bone formation.
Vitamin D insufficiency develops when both sunlight exposure and dietary intake are inadequate.
Insufficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss, and increased risk of skeletal fracture.
In severe cases, deficiency results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia, further increasing the risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic individuals.
Supplemental vitamin D reduces these risks and their consequences.
Osteoporosis is defined as bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine or hip 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean value of a normal young population or as a previous fragility fracture, irrespective of BMD.
FOSAVANCE studies The effect of FOSAVANCE (alendronate 70 mg/ vitamin D3 2800 IU) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multinational study that enrolled 682 osteoporotic post-menopausal women (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at baseline: mean, 56 nmol/ l [22.3 ng/ ml]; range, 22.5- 225 nmol/ l [9-90 ng/ ml]).
Patients received the lower strength (70 mg/ 2800 IU) of FOSAVANCE (n=350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg (n=332) once a week; additional vitamin D supplements
7 were prohibited.
After 15 weeks of treatment, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher (26%) in the FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) group (56 nmol/ l [23 ng/ ml]) than in the alendronate-only group (46 nmol/ l [18.2 ng/ ml]).
The percentage of patients with vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 37.5 nmol/ l [< 15 ng/ ml]) was significantly reduced by 62.5% with FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) vs. alendronate-only (12% vs.
32%, respectively), through week 15.
The percentage of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <  22.5 nmol/ l [<  9 ng/ ml]) was significantly reduced by 92% with FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) vs. alendronate-only (1% vs 13%, respectively).
In this study, mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients with vitamin D insufficiency at baseline (25- hydroxyvitamin D, 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l [9 to < 15 ng/ ml]) increased from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) at week 15 in the FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) group (n=75) and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at baseline to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) at week 15 in the alendronate-only group (n=70).
There were no differences in mean serum calcium, phosphate, or 24-hour urine calcium between treatment groups.
Alendronate studies The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate once weekly 70 mg (n=519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n=370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicentre study of post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
The mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg once-weekly group and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
The mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% at the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% at the total hip in the 70 mg once weekly and 10 mg daily groups, respectively.
The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were examined in two initial efficacy studies of identical design (n=994) as well as in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT: n=6,459).
In the initial efficacy studies, the mean BMD increases with alendronate 10 mg/ day relative to placebo at three years were 8.8%, 5.9% and 7.8% at the spine, femoral neck and trochanter, respectively.
Total body BMD also increased significantly.
There was a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs placebo 6.2%) in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate experiencing one or more vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo.
In the two-year extension of these studies BMD at the spine and trochanter continued to increase and BMD at the femoral neck and total body were maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies using alendronate daily (5 mg daily for two years and 10 mg daily for either one or two additional years):
• FIT 1:
A three-year study of 2,027 patients who had at least one baseline vertebral (compression) fracture.
In this study alendronate daily reduced the incidence of ≥ 1 new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a statistically significant reduction was found in the incidence of hip fractures (1.1% vs.
2.2%, a reduction of 51%).
• FIT 2:
A four-year study of 4,432 patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference was observed in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the global population who correspond with the above definition of osteoporosis) in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%, a reduction of 56%) and in the incidence of ≥ 1 vertebral fracture (2.9% vs.
5.8%, a reduction of 50%).

Pharmacokinetic properties
Alendronate
Absorption Relative to an intravenous reference dose, the oral mean bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardised breakfast.
Bioavailability was decreased similarly to an estimated 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was administered one hour or half an hour before a standardised breakfast.
In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before the first food or beverage of the day.
The alendronate component in the FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) combination tablet is bioequivalent to the alendronate 70 mg tablet.
Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate was administered with, or up to two hours after, a standardised breakfast.
Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.
In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) did not produce a clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20% to 44%).
Distribution Studies in rats show that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/ kg intravenous administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine.
The mean steady-state volume of distribution, exclusive of bone, is at least 28 litres in humans.
Concentrations of alendronate in plasma following therapeutic oral doses are too low for analytical detection (< 5 ng/ ml).
Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%.
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
Elimination Following a single intravenous dose of [14C]alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces.
Following a single 10 mg intravenous dose, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min, and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within six hours following intravenous administration.
The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed ten years, reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton.
Alendronate is not excreted through the acidic or basic transport systems of the kidney in rats, and thus it is not anticipated to interfere with the excretion of other medicinal products by those systems in humans.
Colecalciferol
Absorption In healthy adult subjects (males and females), following administration of FOSAVANCE after an overnight fast and two hours before a meal, the mean area under the serum-concentration-time curve (AUC0-120 hrs) for vitamin D3 (unadjusted for endogenous vitamin D3 levels) was 296.4 ng• hr/ ml.
The mean maximal serum concentration (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng/ ml, and the median time to maximal serum concentration (Tmax) was 12 hours.
The bioavailability of the 2800 IU vitamin D3 in FOSAVANCE is similar to 2800 IU vitamin D3 administered alone.
Distribution Following absorption, vitamin D3 enters the blood as part of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed mostly to the liver where it undergoes metabolism to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the major storage form.
Lesser amounts are distributed to adipose and muscle tissue and stored as vitamin D3 at
9 these sites for later release into the circulation.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein.
Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly metabolized by hydroxylation in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and subsequently metabolized in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which represents the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs prior to elimination.
A small percentage of vitamin D3 undergoes glucuronidation prior to elimination.
Elimination When radioactive vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean urinary excretion of radioactivity after 48 hours was 2.4%, and the mean faecal excretion of radioactivity after 4 days was 4.9%.
In both cases, the excreted radioactivity was almost exclusively as metabolites of the parent.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum following an oral dose of FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) is approximately 24 hours.
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies show that alendronate that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the urine.
No evidence of saturation of bone uptake was found after chronic dosing with cumulative intravenous doses up to 35 mg/ kg in animals.
Although no clinical information is available, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function.
Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical studies with the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol have not been conducted.
Alendronate Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.
Studies in rats have shown that treatment with alendronate during pregnancy was associated with dystocia in dams during parturition which was related to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, rats given high doses showed an increased incidence of incomplete foetal ossification.
The relevance to humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol At doses far higher than the human therapeutic range, reproductive toxicity has been observed in animal studies.

4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients who are not receiving vitamin D supplementation and are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency.
FOSAVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The recommended dosage is one FOSAVANCE tablet once weekly.
Due to the nature of the disease process in osteoporosis, FOSAVANCE is intended for long-term use.
To permit adequate absorption of alendronate:
FOSAVANCE must be taken with water only (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medicinal product (including antacids, calcium supplements and vitamins) of the day.
Other beverages (including mineral water), food and some medicinal products are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate (see section 4.5).
The following instructions should be followed exactly in order to minimize the risk of oesophageal irritation and related adverse reactions (see section 4.4):
• FOSAVANCE should only be swallowed after getting up for the day with a full glass of water (not less than 200ml or 7fl. oz.).
• Patients should not chew the tablet or allow the tablet to dissolve in their mouths because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.
• Patients should not lie down until after their first food of the day which should be at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
12 • Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking FOSAVANCE.
• FOSAVANCE should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day.
Patients should receive supplemental calcium if intake from diet is inadequate (see section 4.4)..
The equivalence of intake of 5600 IU of vitamin D3 weekly in FOSAVANCE to daily dosing of vitamin D 800 IU has not been studied.
Use in the elderly:
In clinical studies there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profiles of alendronate.
Therefore no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly.
Use in renal impairment:
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 35ml/ min.
FOSAVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment where GFR is less than 35ml/ min, due to lack of experience.
Use in children and adolescents:
FOSAVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and therefore should not be given to them.
4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.
• Abnormalities of the oesophagus and other factors which delay oesophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia.
• Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
• Hypocalcaemia.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Alendronate Alendronate can cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa.
Because there is a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when alendronate is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dysphagia, oesophageal disease, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with a recent history (within the previous year) of major gastrointestinal disease such as peptic ulcer, or active gastrointestinal bleeding, or surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).
Oesophageal reactions (sometimes severe and requiring hospitalisation), such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, rarely followed by oesophageal stricture, have been reported in patients receiving alendronate.
Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signalling a possible oesophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue alendronate and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain on swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be greater in patients who fail to take alendronate properly and/ or who continue to take alendronate after developing symptoms suggestive of oesophageal irritation.
It is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and are understood by the patient (see section 4.2).
Patients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase their risk of oesophageal problems.
13 While no increased risk was observed in extensive clinical trials with alendronate, there have been rare (post-marketing) reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers, some of which were severe and with complications (see section 4.8).
Osteonecrosis of the jaw, generally associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis) has been reported in patients with cancer who are receiving treatment regimens including primarily intravenously administered bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in patients with osteoporosis receiving oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease).
While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible.
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition.
For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
Clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment.
Bone, joint, and/ or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates.
In post-marketing experience, these symptoms have rarely been severe and/ or incapacitating (see section 4.8).
The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment.
Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment.
A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same medicinal product or another bisphosphonate.
Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of FOSAVANCE they should take one tablet on the morning after they remember.
They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.
FOSAVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment where GFR is less than 35ml/ min (see section 4.2).
Causes of osteoporosis other than oestrogen deficiency and ageing should be considered.
Hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with FOSAVANCE (see section 4.3).
Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be effectively treated before starting FOSAVANCE.
The content of vitamin D in FOSAVANCE is not suitable for correction of vitamin D deficiency.
In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored during therapy with FOSAVANCE.
Due to the positive effects of alendronate in increasing bone mineral, decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur.
These are usually small and asymptomatic.
However, there have been rare reports of symptomatic hypocalcaemia, which have occasionally been severe and often occurred in patients with predisposing conditions (e. g. hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption) (see section 4.8).
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the magnitude of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with disease associated with unregulated overproduction of calcitriol (e. g. leukaemia, lymphoma, sarcoidosis).
Urine and serum calcium should be monitored in these patients.
Patients with malabsorption may not adequately absorb vitamin D3.
14 Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Alendronate If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate.
Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
No other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products are anticipated.
A number of patients in the clinical trials received oestrogen (intravaginal, transdermal, or oral) while taking alendronate.
No adverse reactions attributable to their concomitant use were identified.
Although specific interaction studies were not performed, in clinical studies alendronate was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed medicinal products without evidence of interactions of clinical relevance.
Colecalciferol Olestra, mineral oils, orlistat, and bile acid sequestrants (e. g. cholestyramine, colestipol) may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants, cimetidine and thiazides may increase the catabolism of vitamin D.
Additional vitamin D supplements may be considered on an individual basis.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
FOSAVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and therefore it should not be used during pregnancy or in breast-feeding women.
There are no adequate data from the use of FOSAVANCE in pregnant women.
Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, or postnatal development.
Alendronate given during pregnancy in rats caused dystocia related to hypocalcaemia (see section 5.3).
Studies in animals have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity with high doses of vitamin D (see section 5.3).
It is not known whether alendronate is excreted into human breast milk.
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, there is no information to indicate that FOSAVANCE affects a patient’ s ability to drive or operate machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies and/ or post-marketing use with alendronate.
No additional adverse reactions have been identified for FOSAVANCE.

Musculoskeletal,
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated by
connective tissue and bisphosphonates.
The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients, bone disorders:
but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is generally associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Diagnosis of cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also deemed as risk factors (see section 4.4); joint swelling.
General disorders and asthenia, peripheral oedema administration site conditions:
Laboratory test findings In clinical studies, asymptomatic, mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking alendronate 10 mg/ day versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo.
However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to < 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to ≤ 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) were similar in both treatment groups.
16 4.9 Overdose
Alendronate Hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as upset stomach, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer, may result from oral overdose.
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with alendronate.
In case of overdose with FOSAVANCE, milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate.
Owing to the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright.
Colecalciferol Vitamin D toxicity has not been documented during chronic therapy in generally healthy adults at a dose less than 10,000 IU/ day.
In a clinical study of healthy adults a 4000 IU daily dose of vitamin D3 for up to five months was not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1.
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Bisphosphonates, combinations, ATC code:
M05BB03.
FOSAVANCE is a combination tablet containing the two active substances alendronate sodium trihydrate and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate Alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation.
Preclinical studies have shown preferential localisation of alendronate to sites of active resorption.
Activity of osteoclasts is inhibited, but recruitment or attachment of osteoclasts is not affected.
The bone formed during treatment with alendronate is of normal quality.
Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 by ultraviolet light.
In the absence of adequate sunlight exposure, vitamin D3 is an essential dietary nutrient.
Vitamin D3 is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver, and stored until needed.
Conversion to the active calcium-mobilizing hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the kidney is tightly regulated.
The principal action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of both calcium and phosphate as well as regulate serum calcium, renal calcium and phosphate excretion, bone formation and bone resorption.
Vitamin D3 is required for normal bone formation.
Vitamin D insufficiency develops when both sunlight exposure and dietary intake are inadequate.
Insufficiency is associated with negative calcium balance, bone loss, and increased risk of skeletal fracture.
In severe cases, deficiency results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia, further increasing the risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic individuals.
Supplemental vitamin D reduces these risks and their consequences.
Osteoporosis is defined as bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine or hip 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean value of a normal young population or as a previous fragility fracture, irrespective of BMD.
FOSAVANCE studies The effect of the lower dose of FOSAVANCE (alendronate 70 mg/ vitamin D3 2800 IU) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week, multinational study that enrolled 682 osteoporotic post- menopausal women (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at baseline: mean, 56 nmol/ l [22.3 ng/ ml]; range, 22.5-225 nmol/ l [9-90 ng/ ml]).
Patients received the lower strength (70 mg/ 2800 IU) of FOSAVANCE (n=350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg (n=332) once a week; additional vitamin
17 D supplements were prohibited.
After 15 weeks of treatment, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher (26%) in the FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) group (56 nmol/ l [23 ng/ ml]) than in the alendronate-only group (46 nmol/ l [18.2 ng/ ml]).
The percentage of patients with vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 37.5 nmol/ l [< 15 ng/ ml]) was significantly reduced by 62.5% with FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) vs. alendronate-only (12% vs.
32%, respectively), through week 15.
The percentage of patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D <  22.5 nmol/ l [<  9 ng/ ml]) was significantly reduced by 92% with FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) vs. alendronate-only (1% vs 13%, respectively).
In this study, mean 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients with vitamin D insufficiency at baseline (25- hydroxyvitamin D, 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l [9 to < 15 ng/ ml]) increased from 30 nmol/ l (12.1 ng/ ml) to 40 nmol/ l (15.9 ng/ ml) at week 15 in the FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) group (n=75) and decreased from 30 nmol/ l (12.0 ng/ ml) at baseline to 26 nmol/ l (10.4 ng/ ml) at week 15 in the alendronate-only group (n=70).
There were no differences in mean serum calcium, phosphate, or 24-hour urine calcium between treatment groups.
The effect of the lower dose of FOSAVANCE (alendronate 70 mg/ vitamin D3 2800 IU) plus an additional 2800 IU Vitamin D3 for a total of 5600 IU (the amount of vitamin D3 in the higher dose of FOSAVANCE) once weekly was demonstrated in a 24-week, extension study that enrolled 619 osteoporotic post-menopausal women.
Patients in the Vitamin D3 2800 group received FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) (n=299) and patients in the Vitamin D3 5600 group received FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) plus an additional 2800 IU vitamin D3 (n=309) once a week; additional vitamin D supplements were allowed.
After 24-weeks of treatment, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher in the Vitamin D3 5600 group (69 nmol/ l [27.6 ng/ ml]) than in the Vitamin D3 2800 group (64 nmol/ l [25.5 ng/ ml]).
The percentage of patients with vitamin D insufficiency was 5.4% in the Vitamin D3 2800 group vs.
3.2% in the Vitamin D3 5600 group through the 24-week extension.
The percentage of patients with vitamin D deficiency was 0.3% in the Vitamin D3 2800 group vs. zero in the Vitamin D3 5600 group.
There were no differences in mean serum calcium, phosphate, or 24-hour urine calcium between treatment groups.
The percentage of patients with hypercalciuria at the end of the 24-week extension was not statistically different between treatment groups.
Alendronate studies The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate once weekly 70 mg (n=519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n=370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicentre study of post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.
The mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 5.1% (95% CI:
4.8, 5.4%) in the 70 mg once-weekly group and 5.4% (95% CI:
5.0, 5.8%) in the 10 mg daily group.
The mean BMD increases were 2.3% and 2.9% at the femoral neck and 2.9% and 3.1% at the total hip in the 70 mg once weekly and 10 mg daily groups, respectively.
The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites.
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were examined in two initial efficacy studies of identical design (n=994) as well as in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT: n=6,459).
In the initial efficacy studies, the mean BMD increases with alendronate 10 mg/ day relative to placebo at three years were 8.8%, 5.9% and 7.8% at the spine, femoral neck and trochanter, respectively.
Total body BMD also increased significantly.
There was a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs placebo 6.2%) in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate experiencing one or more vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo.
In the two-year extension of these studies BMD at the spine and trochanter continued to increase and BMD at the femoral neck and total body were maintained.
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies using alendronate daily (5 mg daily for two years and 10 mg daily for either one or two additional years):
• FIT 1:
A three-year study of 2,027 patients who had at least one baseline vertebral (compression) fracture.
In this study alendronate daily reduced the incidence of ≥ 1 new
18 vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).
In addition, a statistically significant reduction was found in the incidence of hip fractures (1.1% vs.
2.2%, a reduction of 51%).
• FIT 2:
A four-year study of 4,432 patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture.
In this study, a significant difference was observed in the analysis of the subgroup of osteoporotic women (37% of the global population who correspond with the above definition of osteoporosis) in the incidence of hip fractures (alendronate 1.0% vs. placebo 2.2%, a reduction of 56%) and in the incidence of ≥ 1 vertebral fracture (2.9% vs.
5.8%, a reduction of 50%).
5.2.
Pharmacokinetic properties
Alendronate
Absorption Relative to an intravenous reference dose, the oral mean bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardised breakfast.
Bioavailability was decreased similarly to an estimated 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was administered one hour or half an hour before a standardised breakfast.
In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before the first food or beverage of the day.
The alendronate component in the FOSAVANCE (70mg/ 5600 IU) combination tablet is bioequivalent to the alendronate 70 mg tablet.
Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate was administered with, or up to two hours after, a standardised breakfast.
Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.
In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) did not produce a clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20% to 44%).
Distribution Studies in rats show that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/ kg intravenous administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine.
The mean steady-state volume of distribution, exclusive of bone, is at least 28 litres in humans.
Concentrations of alendronate in plasma following therapeutic oral doses are too low for analytical detection (< 5 ng/ ml).
Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%.
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans.
Elimination Following a single intravenous dose of [14C]alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces.
Following a single 10 mg intravenous dose, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min, and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within six hours following intravenous administration.
The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed ten years, reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton.
Alendronate is not excreted through the acidic or basic transport systems of the kidney in rats, and thus it is not anticipated to interfere with the excretion of other medicinal products by those systems in humans.
19 Colecalciferol
Absorption In healthy adult subjects (males and females), following administration of FOSAVANCE 70 mg/ 5600 IU after an overnight fast and two hours before a meal, the mean area under the serum- concentration-time curve (AUC0-80 hrs) for vitamin D3 (unadjusted for endogenous vitamin D3 levels) was 490.2 ng• hr/ ml.
The mean maximal serum concentration (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 12.2 ng/ ml and the median time to maximal serum concentration (Tmax) was 10.6 hours.
The bioavailability of the 5600 IU vitamin D3 in FOSAVANCE is similar to 5600 IU vitamin D3 administered alone.
Distribution Following absorption, vitamin D3 enters the blood as part of chylomicrons.
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed mostly to the liver where it undergoes metabolism to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the major storage form.
Lesser amounts are distributed to adipose and muscle tissue and stored as vitamin D3 at these sites for later release into the circulation.
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein.
Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly metabolized by hydroxylation in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and subsequently metabolized in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which represents the biologically active form.
Further hydroxylation occurs prior to elimination.
A small percentage of vitamin D3 undergoes glucuronidation prior to elimination.
Elimination When radioactive vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean urinary excretion of radioactivity after 48 hours was 2.4%, and the mean faecal excretion of radioactivity after 4 days was 4.9%.
In both cases, the excreted radioactivity was almost exclusively as metabolites of the parent.
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum following an oral dose of FOSAVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) is approximately 24 hours.
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies show that alendronate that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the urine.
No evidence of saturation of bone uptake was found after chronic dosing with cumulative intravenous doses up to 35 mg/ kg in animals.
Although no clinical information is available, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function.
Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical studies with the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol have not been conducted.
Alendronate Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.
Studies in rats have shown that treatment with alendronate during pregnancy was associated with dystocia in dams during parturition which was related to hypocalcaemia.
In studies, rats given high doses showed an increased incidence of incomplete foetal ossification.
The relevance to humans is unknown.
Colecalciferol At doses far higher than the human therapeutic range, reproductive toxicity has been observed in animal studies.

1.
WHAT FOSAVANCE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
What is FOSAVANCE?
FOSAVANCE is a tablet containing the two active substances, alendronate sodium trihydrate and colecalciferol known as vitamin D3.
What is alendronate?
Alendronate belongs to a group of non-hormonal medicines called bisphosphonates.
Alendronate prevents the loss of bone that occurs in women after they have been through the menopause, and helps to rebuild bone.
It reduces the risk of spine and hip fractures.
What is vitamin D?
Vitamin D is an essential nutrient, required for calcium absorption and healthy bones.
The body can only absorb calcium properly from our food if it has enough vitamin D.
Very few foods contain vitamin D.
The main source is through exposure to summer sunlight, which makes vitamin D in our skin.
As we get older our skin makes less vitamin D.
Too little vitamin D may lead to bone loss and osteoporosis.
Severe vitamin D deficiency may cause muscle weakness which can lead to falls and a greater risk of fractures.
What is FOSAVANCE used for?
Your doctor has prescribed FOSAVANCE to treat your osteoporosis and because you are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency.
FOSAVANCE reduces the risk of spine and hip fractures.
FOSAVANCE is a once weekly treatment.
What is osteoporosis?
Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones.
It is common in women after the menopause.
At the menopause, the ovaries stop producing the female hormone, oestrogen, which helps to keep a woman’ s skeleton healthy.
As a result, bone loss occurs and bones become weaker.
The earlier a woman reaches the menopause, the greater the risk of osteoporosis.
38 Early on, osteoporosis usually has no symptoms.
If left untreated, however, it can result in broken bones.
Although these usually hurt, breaks in the bones of the spine may go unnoticed until they cause height loss.
Broken bones can happen during normal, everyday activity, such as lifting, or from minor injury that would not generally break normal bone.
Broken bones usually occur at the hip, spine, or wrist and can lead not only to pain but also to considerable problems like stooped posture (‘ dowager’ s hump’) and loss of mobility.
How can osteoporosis be treated?
Osteoporosis can be treated and it is never too late to begin treatment.
FOSAVANCE not only prevents the loss of bone but actually helps to rebuild bone you may have lost and reduces the risk of bones breaking in the spine and hip.
As well as your treatment with FOSAVANCE, your doctor may suggest you make changes to your lifestyle to help your condition, such as:
Stopping smoking
Smoking appears to increase the rate at which you lose bone and, therefore, may increase your risk of broken bones.
Exercise
Like muscles, bones need exercise to stay strong and healthy.
Consult your doctor before you begin any exercise programme.
Eating a balanced diet Your doctor can advise you about your diet or whether you should take any dietary supplements.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE FOSAVANCE
Do not take FOSAVANCE (1) if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to alendronate sodium trihydrate, colecalciferol or any of the other ingredients, (2) if you have certain problems with your gullet (oesophagus - the tube that connects your mouth with your stomach) such as narrowing or difficulty swallowing, (3) if you cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes, (4) if your doctor has told you that you have low blood calcium.
If you think any of these apply to you, do not take the tablets.
Talk to your doctor first and follow the advice given.
Take special care with FOSAVANCE It is important to tell your doctor before taking FOSAVANCE • if you suffer from kidney problems, • if you have any allergies, • if you have any swallowing or digestive problems, • if you have low blood calcium levels, • if you have cancer, • if you are undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy, • if you are taking steroids, • if you don’ t receive routine dental care.
Irritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet (oesophagus – the tube that connects your mouth with your stomach) often with symptoms of chest pain, heartburn, or difficulty or pain upon swallowing may occur, especially if patients do not drink a full glass of water and/ or if they lie down less than 30 minutes after taking FOSAVANCE.
These side effects may worsen if patients continue to take FOSAVANCE after developing these symptoms.
39 Children and adolescents FOSAVANCE should not be given to children and adolescents.
Taking other medicines It is likely that calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicines will interfere with the absorption of FOSAVANCE if taken at the same time.
Therefore, it is important that you follow the advice given in section 3.
HOW TO TAKE FOSAVANCE.
It is likely that certain medicines or food additives may prevent the vitamin D in FOSAVANCE from getting into your body, including artificial fat substitutes, mineral oils, orlistat and the cholesterol- lowering medicines, cholestyramine and colestipol.
Medicines for fits (seizures) may decrease the effectiveness of vitamin D.
Additional vitamin D supplements may be considered on an individual basis.
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Taking FOSAVANCE with food and drink It is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water) will make FOSAVANCE less effective if taken at the same time.
Therefore, it is important that you follow the advice given in section 3.
HOW TO TAKE FOSAVANCE.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding FOSAVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women.
You should not take FOSAVANCE if you are or think you may be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines FOSAVANCE should not affect your ability to drive or operate machines.
