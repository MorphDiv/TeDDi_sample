The desktop
How do I add an application to the desktop?
Just choose the desired application from the K menu and drag and drop it to the Desktop.
For applications not listed in the K menu, use the & RMB; on the desktop and choose Create New Link to Application... and fill in the configuration for the application you want to link to.
How do I mount/ unmount a device from the desktop?
First, make sure you are allowed to mount / umount the relevant device as a user.
Then you can add any device by clicking on the desktop with the & RMB; and then choosing Create New Link to Device. Select the device of the type you wish to control. Fill in the settings for the device in the dialog that appears and click OK. You can use the resulting desktop icon to mount/ unmount the device from the desktop.
Where are the icons kept?
The icons can be found only in $KDEDIRS / share/ icons or $HOME /. kde/ share/ icons. To use icons stored in other locations, you must either copy them into one of the above-mentioned fixed & kde; locations or make symlinks.
How do I use the mouse scroll wheel in & kde;?
Mouse wheel support comes with & Qt; 2.0 and above, so & kde; based on that will automatically support the use of the mouse scroll wheel if your system is configured correctly. Check that your & X-Server; settings support the use of a scrollwheel if it is not working.
How do I launch applications in a particular desktop?
& kde; comes with a program called & kstart;. To start an xterm on the second desktop and then activate it use: kstart --desktop 2 --activate --window "xterm" xterm.
Note that the --window option is important. It takes an argument which is a regular expression matching the title of the window to apply the settings to.
Please read kstart --help-all for more magic available with & kstart; (and there is an abundance).
Where do I save my files if I want them to appear directly on the desktop?
$HOME / Desktop. You might need to refresh your desktop after you have saved your files.
I've deleted the Trash icon on my desktop. How can I get it back?
Right-click on the desktop and in the context menu that appears, choose Create New... Link to Location (URL).... Set the File name to Trash and the location to trash: /. Click on OK and you're done.
