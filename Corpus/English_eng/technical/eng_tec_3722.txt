On error the function returns FALSE.
If the IV is ignored in the specified cipher / mode combination zero is returned.
cipher is one of the MCRYPT_ciphername constants of the name of the algorithm as string.
mode is one of the MCRYPT_MODE_modename constants of one of "ecb", "cbc", "cfb", "ofb", "nofb" or "stream ".
