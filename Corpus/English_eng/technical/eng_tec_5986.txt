Spell Options
Auto spell check enabled by default
If a mark is placed in this checkbox, the spelling of words will be check in your document as you type them. Misspelled will have a red line drawn under them.
Skip all uppercase words
If a mark is placed in this checkbox, the spelling of any word which consists of all capital letters will not be checked.
This is useful for document using a large number of acronyms. If this box is left unchecked, most of those acronyms will be incorrectly marked. By placing a mark in this checkbox, the acronyms will not be marked as misspelled.
Skip run-together words
If this box is not checked, then words that appear in the dictionary separately, but have been run together, are considered to be spelling errors. Examples of such words are shutout, cannot, and blackout.
Checking this box will help prevent applications from flagging website and email addresses for spelling errors. These addresses often contain words run together.
Ignoring words
The bottom half of the dialog box allows you to designate specific words (they may be specialized terminology, proper names, & etc;) which should be ignored by the spelling program.
Adding a word to the ignore list
To add a word, type the word in the text box and click the Add button.
Deleting a word from the ignore list
To remove a word, select the word in the listbox containing all the currently ignored words by clicking on it with the & LMB;. Now click the Remove button.
Changing the order a word appears in the list
To move a word in the list, select the word in the listbox containing all the currently ignored words by clicking on it with the & LMB;. Now click the Move Up button or the Move Down button to move the word within the list.
When you are happy with the changes, simply click Apply.
Clicking on the Defaults button restores all values to their default values.
Create root/ affix combinations not in dictionary
Selecting this option allows the spell checker to register as correct combinations of root words with suffixes or prefixes even if the particular combination is not listed in its dictionary database of words.
Consider run-together words as spelling errors
Dictionary:
Encoding:
You should select the one that matches the character set you are using. In some cases, dictionaries will support more than one encoding. A dictionary might, for example, accept accented characters when Latin1 is selected, but accept email-style character combinations (like'a for an accented a) when 7-Bit-ASCII is selected. Please see your dictionary's distribution for more information.
Client:
You can choose which of the installed client applications on your system to use. For example, you can choose ispell.
