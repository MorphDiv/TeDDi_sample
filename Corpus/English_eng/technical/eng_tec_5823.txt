File Splitter
File Splitter
This function splits one (large) file up into multiple smaller files so that they can be placed on smaller media (e. g. zip-drives,...) or sent by e-mail. The multiple files can be combined again to recreate the original file. & krusader; and Total Commander split/ combine functions are compatible. To split a file choose File Split or Ctrl; P A Split dialog will open to confirm the operation.
If the name of the original file is foo, then the name of the smaller files will be foo.000 foo.001 foo.002 & etc; There is no theoretical limit in the number of smaller files, but it is recommended to limit the number to a maximum of 1023 files. & krusader; creates a foo. crc file. This file contains the name, size and the crc checksum of the original file. It is possible to combine the file without the foo. crc file but in this case & krusader; cannot check if the original file was recreated correctly.
An example of a foo. crc file:
filename=foo size=432998467868 crc32=21EB719A
To combine the multiple files choose, select a partial file foo. xxx and choose File Combine files or Ctrl; B. The target directory is the inactive panel and can be changed. The file names must be numbered in ascending order: foo.001, foo.002, foo.003 & etc; or have letters in ascending order: ("split -b letter method") fileaa, fileab, fileac & etc; If the file foo. crc is found in the same directory as the partial files, & krusader; will use this file to check the combined file for errors.
