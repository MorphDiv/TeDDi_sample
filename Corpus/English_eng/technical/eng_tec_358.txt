Select the data range.
Click one of the options for data series in rows or in columns.
Check whether the data range has labels in the first row or in the first column or both.
Organising data series
In the Data Series list box you will see a list of all data series in the current chart.
The column data series are positioned at the top of the list, the line data series at the bottom of the list.
To organise the data series, select an entry from the list.
Click Add to add another data series below the selected entry.
The new data series has the same type as the selected entry.
Click Remove to remove the selected entry from the Data Series list.
Use the Up and Down arrow buttons to move the selected entry in the list up or down.
This way you can convert a Column data series to a List data series and back.
This does not change the order in the data source table, but changes only the arrangement in the chart.
Editing data series
Click an entry in the list to view and edit the properties for that entry.
In the Data Ranges list box you will see the role names and cell ranges of the data series components.
Click an entry, then edit the contents in the text box below.
The label next to the text box states the currently selected role.
Select data range
to minimise the dialogue box and select the range with the mouse.
The range for a data role, like Y-Values, must not include a label cell.
Editing categories or data labels
Enter or select a cell range that will be used as text for categories or data labels.
The values in the Categories range will be shown as labels on the x-axis.
