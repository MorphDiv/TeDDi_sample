Create New Adabas Database
/text/shared/explorer/database/30100000.xhp
Create New Adabas Database
Adabas database
.
Database name
Type the name of the database.
The name is added to the
Data source URL
field.
User settings
Administrator
Enter the name of the database administrator.
The administrator name and password is assigned when you create an Adabas database.
Apart from the administrator, two more users can access the Adabas database.
Control User
Enter the name of a user that you want to give limited control to modify some parameters of the database.
Normally, the default settings for the name and the password of the control user are not changed.
The control user does not affect the three-user limitation.
Domain User
Enter the name of the domain user that is used by Adabas internally.
Normally, the default settings for the name and password of the domain user are not changed.
The domain user does not affect the three-user limit.
Password
Enter a password.
Database settings
Drives containing parts of the Serverdb are called DEVSPACEs.
To improve performance, store each DEVSPACE on separate drives.
The file path for a DEVSPACE, including its file name, cannot exceed 40 characters.
SYSDEVSPACE
Enter the path for the system DEVSPACE.
The SYSDEVSPACE manages the configuration data for the database.
The size of the SYSDEVSPACE depends on the size of the database.
TRANSACTIONLOG
Enter the path for the transaction log file.
This file records all modifications that are made to the database during a transaction, and overwrites them when the transaction is completed.
The TRANSACTIONLOG is also used for rolling back a transaction.
DATADEVSPACE
Enter the path for the data DEVSPACE.
This file stores user data, such as tables and indexes, as well as the SQL catalogue (schema info).
The data contained in one user table is evenly distributed across all DATADEVSPACEs.
The combined size of all DATADEVSPACEs corresponds to the size of the database.
The maximum size for a DATADEVSPACE in the limited version Adabas database is 100MB.
If the DATADEVSPACE reaches full capacity during a database operation, Adabas shuts down, increases the capacity of the DATADEVSPACE (up to 100 MB), and restarts the database.
Saved data is not lost.
...
OK
.
Transaction file (MB)
Enter the size of the transaction file in megabytes.
Database size (MB)
Enter the size of the database in megabytes here.
The maximum size is 100 MB.
Data buffer size (MB)
Enter the size of the data cache in megabytes.
The data buffer can be simultaneously accessed by all users and stores the most recently accessed pages from the DATADEVSPACEs.
