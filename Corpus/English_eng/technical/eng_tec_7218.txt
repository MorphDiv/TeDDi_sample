6. Bookmarks
Storing and retrieving objects

You are not limited to a single object: You can set up to six bookmarks per environment. You can also save bookmarks so that they will persist from Orca session to Orca session.
Having set a bookmark you can navigate to it later, and do so regardless of whether or not you have chosen to permanently save the bookmarks associated with your current environment. Navigation can be based on the number of the bookmark should you wish to jump directly to a specific item. Alternatively, you can navigate to the next or previous bookmark just like you can a
Bookmarkable objects can be widgets within an application or objects on the web page you are reading. Which environment you are in determines what happens as you navigate amongst bookmarks: If you are in web content, the caret will be moved to the bookmark so that you can continue reading; otherwise,
Finally, there is Where Am I information for bookmarks which lets you know where the specified bookmark is relative to your current location.
The specific keybindings associated with each of the above tasks can be found in

In addition, if the window's contents change of their own accord, the Flat Review context will not automatically be updated. You can cause a new context to be built by toggling Flat Review off and back on.

6. Live Regions
Interacting with dynamic web content
A live region is a dynamically-updated portion of a web page, such as a table of sports statistics, a list of current stock prices, a log from a chat, or an alert displayed by the page you are reading. While live regions appear quite frequently, fully accessible web pages with live regions are encountered less often. This problem is actively being addressed by a number of organizations.
Live Region Politeness Levels
Live regions have an associated "politeness" level which is set by the author as a means to convey the importance of the information and to suggest when users should be informed by their assistive technology of updates made within that region. Live regions can be "off", "polite", or "aggressive" to the point of being "rude."

Because you might not agree with the politeness level specified by the author whose page you are viewing,

5. Notifications
Reading previously-received messages
Notifications
The GNOME Desktop includes a "notification area" which can be used by applications to present information to the user. Examples of notifications include incoming chat messages, the details associated with the song your media player is starting to play, and warnings that your battery level is getting low.
Because notifications are intended to present information to users without interrupting what the user is doing, these messages tend to appear and disappear relatively quickly. They are also not focusable. While
Present the last (most recent) notification message
Present the previous notification message
Present list of all notification messages
The first two commands are designed mainly for quick access to a message you just received. The last command is the most powerful as it stores your notification message history.
When you enter the list of notification messages, you will be told the size of the list and prompted with the following choices:
Press H for help.
Use Up, Down, Home or End to navigate in the list.
Press Escape to exit.

Don't Forget To Toggle Structural Navigation On!
Depending on where you are, it may be necessary for you to explicitly toggle Structural Navigation on before you can use it.
When Toggling Structural Navigation On Is Required
In web pages, explicitly toggling Structural Navigation on is generally unnecessary because your interaction with the document largely consists of reading its content. Thus there is no question as to whether the 'H' you just pressed was meant to be a writing command or a navigation command.

Depending on where you are, it may be necessary for you to explicitly toggle Structural Navigation on before you can use it. To learn more, read
Dynamic Headers
Many of the tables you will encounter while reading have cells which serve as the header for a row or a column. Whether or not the creator of that table correctly marked those cells as headers is hard to say. In many cases, the text was simply formatted to be larger and/or bold. And even if the table is correctly marked up, that is no guarantee that the application or toolkit exposes that text as header information to assistive technologies.
Setting Column Headers

Identifying Misspelled Words
Most applications and toolkits indicate that a word is misspelled by underlining that word with a red, squiggly line. The presence of this line is typically exposed to assistive technologies as a text attribute. As a result, you will find spelling errors amongst the text attributes you can choose. By default, the spelling error attribute is enabled for both speech and braille and will therefore be presented along with any other attributes whose indication you have enabled.
In addition to accessing the presence of spelling errors as a text attribute, if you have key echo and/or word echo enabled and type a word which is misspelled, when the spelling error indication appears,

WhereAmI
In addition to dedicated commands for reading the title bar and the status bar, Orca provides two context-sensitive Where Am I commands: Basic Where Am I and Detailed Where Am I. Basic Where Am I is implemented for all objects. Detailed Where Am I is implemented just for those objects for which there is a significant amount of information you may wish to know, but likely will not wish to know all of the time.
The best way to become familiar with what Where Am I will present is to give the
For most widgets, you will at least be told the label and/or name, the type or role of the widget, and the mnemonic and/or accelerator key if they happen to exist. In addition:
If the widget is text, and you perform a basic Where Am I, you will be told the current line if no text is selected. If text is selected, however, a basic Where Am I will tell you what text is selected. A detailed Where Am I within the text will also include the text attributes.
If the widget can be checked, as is the case with checkboxes and radio buttons, the checked state will be included.
If the widget is a list or list-like object, such as a combo box, radio button group, or page tab list, the position of the current item will be included.
If the widget is hierarchical, such as a tree, and you are on an expandable node, you will be told if that node is expanded or not. And if it is expanded, you will also be told how many children it contains. In addition, the nesting level will also be provided.
If the widget is a progress bar or a slider, you will be told the current percent.
If the widget is an icon within an icon group, a basic Where Am I will include the object you are in, the item you are on, and the number of items which are selected. In a detailed Where Am I, you will also be told which items are selected.
If you are on a link, the type of link (same site, different site, FTP link, etc.) will be included.

Configuring what is spoken as you type
Key Echo Preferences
Enable key echo
Orca's key echo setting controls what happens each time you press a key. To enable key echo, check the "Enable key echo" checkbox. Doing so causes additional checkboxes to become available through which you can choose exactly which keys should and should not be echoed to best suit your needs.
Enable alphanumeric and punctuation keys
Enable modifier keys
Enable function keys
Enable action keys
This option controls whether or not
Enable navigation keys
This option controls whether or not
Enable non-spacing diacritical keys
This option controls whether or not "dead keys" used to generate accented letters should be spoken when pressed.
Enable echo by character
Enabling this option causes Orca to echo the character you just typed.
While echo by character seems quite similar to the key echo of alphanumeric and punctuation keys, there are important differences, especially with respect to accented letters and other symbols for which there is no dedicated key:
Key echo causes
Character echo causes
Thus to have accented characters spoken as you type them, you should enable character echo.
Enabling both key echo and character echo
If you like key echo and you frequently type accented characters, consider enabling both.
Enable echo by word and Enable echo by sentence

Pronunciation Preferences
Sometimes your speech synthesizer just doesn't say the right thing for a given string. You might prefer to hear "laughing out loud" rather than "LOL," or "accessibility" rather than "a11y". Or there may be a name or a technical term which the synthesizer mispronounces.

8. Text Attributes
Configuring what formatting is presented
Text Attributes Preferences
The term "text attributes" refers to all of the font, style, alignment, and other formatting associated with a given character or series of characters.
The text attributes table
The text attributes table is where you specify what attributes will and will not be presented and under what conditions. Each row consists of four columns.




For example, by default the "underline" text attribute has a value of "none". This causes
Undoing changes
Beneath the list of text attributes, there is a Reset button (
Rearranging the order of presentation
When you initially display the text attribute page, all of your enabled attributes are placed at the top of the table in the order in which they will be spoken. There are four buttons which can be used to rearrange the order of presentation.
