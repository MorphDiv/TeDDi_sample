Common Tasks

Hopefully, these tutorials will not only help you with your current task, but also get you ready to learn more complex tools and methods later, when you have the time and inspiration.
All you need to know to start this tutorial, is how to find and open your image. (

Scale
You have a huge image, possibly from a digital camera, and you want to resize it so that it displays nicely on a web page, online board or email message.

The first thing that you might notice after opening the image, is that
The other thing to look at in the title-bar is the mode. If the mode shows as RGB in the title bar, you are fine. If the mode says

The unit of size for the purpose of displaying an image on a screen is the pixel. You can see the dialog has two sections: one for

As discussed before, pixels don't have a set size in the real world. When you set out to print an image on paper,
By default, most images open with the resolution set to 72. This number was chosen for historical reasons as it was the resolution of screens in the past, and means that when printed, every pixel is 1/72 of an inch wide. When printing images are taken with modern digital cameras, this produces very large but chunky images with visible pixels. What we want to do is tell

If you have images that take up a large space on disk, you can reduce that space even without changing the image dimensions. The best image compression is achieved by using the

Crop An Image

Image after cropping
There are many reasons to crop an image; for example, fitting an image to fill a frame, removing a portion of the background to emphasize the subject, etc. There are two methods to activate the crop tool. Click the
Select a Region to Crop
Click on one corner of the desired crop area and drag your mouse to create the crop rectangle. You don't have to be accurate as you can change the exact shape of the rectangle later.
Dialog for Cropping
After completing the click and drag motion, a rectangle with special regions is shown on the canvas. As the cursor is moved over the different areas of the selected crop area, the cursor changes. You can then drag the rectangle's corners or edges to change the dimensions of the selected area. As shown in the figure above, as the crop area is resized, the dimensions and ratio are shown in the status bar. See

Finding Info
When you need to find out information about your image, Use

As with anything else, images come in different kinds and serve different purposes. Sometimes, a small size is important (for web sites) and at other times, retaining a high color depth (e.g., a family portrait) is what you want.
Dialog for changing the mode


Dialog
As you might expect, since the information needed to represent the color at each pixel is less, the file size is smaller. However, sometimes, there are options in the various menus that are grayed-out for no apparent reason. This usually means that the filter or option cannot be applied when your image is in its current mode. Changing the mode to RGB, as outlined above, should solve this issue. If RGB mode doesn't work either, perhaps the option you're trying requires your layer to have the ability to be transparent. This can be done just as easily via
Add Alpha Channel

There is no need to convert an image to a specific mode before saving it in your favorite format, as

Separating an Object From Its Background
Object with Background
Sometimes you need to separate the subject of an image from its background. You may want to have the subject on a flat color, or keep the background transparent so you can use it on an existing background, or any other thing you have in mind. To do this, you must first use
