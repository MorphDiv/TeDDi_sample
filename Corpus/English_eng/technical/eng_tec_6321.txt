Joystick configuration module
This module provides an interface to calibrate your joystick device as well as see which functions on your joystick are mapped to which logical button or axis.
Here's a screenshot of the joystick module
The joystick module
Device
Here you can see the logical location of the device. If you have more than one joystick device, you can also select which one to configure.
Position
The plotted location of the X and Y axes of the joystick. Enable Show trace to plot the path of the joystick from one point to another.
If the joystick cannot reach every point on this graph, or if it does not center correctly, you need to calibrate your device.
Buttons
A place to see the pressed state of buttons on your joystick and if the buttons are mapped correctly. When a joystick button is pressed, PRESSED will appear next to the logical number (as the computer sees it) of the button which was pressed.
Axes
This displays the numerical values of the axis positions. 0 is centered and the maximum and minimum values depend on the joystick and the particular axis.
Calibrate
Clicking on Calibrate will open a dialog to calibrate every axis on your joystick.

Calibrating your joystick
Each axis will have to be moved to the minimum position, then the center, and finally the maximum position. A meter in the bottom left corner of the dialog will help determine which way increases and which way decreases the values.
