EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
GONAL-F
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is GONAL-f?
GONAL-f is available either as a solution for injection in a pre-filled pen or as a powder and solvent to be made up into a solution for injection.
GONAL-f contains the active substance follitropin alfa.
What is GONAL-f used for?
GONAL-f is used to treat women in the following cases: • Women who are anovulatory (do not produce eggs) and do not respond to treatment with clomiphene citrate (another medicine that stimulates ovulation). • Women who are undergoing fertility treatment (assisted reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilisation).
GONAL-f is administered to stimulate the ovaries to produce more than one egg at the time. • Women with severe hormone deficiency for luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).
GONAL-f is administered together with a LH preparation to stimulate egg maturation in the ovaries.
GONAL-f can also be used together with human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) to stimulate sperm production in men who have hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (a rare hormone deficiency disease).
GONAL-f can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is GONAL-f used?
Treatment with GONAL-f should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is given subcutaneously (under the skin).
If using the powder, it should be mixed with the solvent provided just before use, and the contents of more than one vial of powder can be dissolved in one vial of solvent if needed.
The patient or their partner may carry out subcutaneous injection of GONAL-f if they have been properly instructed.
The dosage and frequency of administration of GONAL-f depend on its use (see above) and the patient ’ s response to treatment.
For a full description of the dosages, please see the Package Leaflet.
How does GONAL-f work?
The active substance in GONAL-f, follitropin alfa, is a copy of the natural hormone FSH (follicle stimulating hormone).
In the body, FSH regulates the reproductive function: in women, it stimulates the production of eggs and in men, it stimulates the production of sperm by the testicles.
Previously, the FSH used as a medicine was extracted from urine.
The follitropin alpha in GONAL-f is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’.
It is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce human FSH.

The effectiveness of GONAL-f has been studied as part of an assisted reproductive procedure in 470 patients, and in 222 women who could not ovulate.
In these studies, GONAL-f was compared to human FSH that had been extracted from urine.
GONAL-f has also been studied in 38 women with severe LH/ FSH deficiency and in 19 men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.
Because of the rarity of the conditions, these two studies were uncontrolled (GONAL-f was not compared to another treatment).
What benefit has GONAL-f shown during the studies?
GONAL-f was as effective as the comparator to stimulate ovaries during assisted reproductive procedures.
In women who could not ovulate, GONAL-f produced ovulation in 84% of women compared with 91% for the Comparator.
It was also effective in triggering egg development in women with severe LF/ FSH deficiency.
In the study in men GONAL-f was effective in stimulating sperm production:
63% of patients achieved sperm counts above 1.5 million/ ml.
The studies in women with severe LH/ FSH deficiency and in men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism had low numbers of patients but were acceptable because these are rare conditions.
What is the risk associated with GONAL-f?
The most common side effects (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are ovarian cysts, local reactions at the site of the injection (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation), and headache.
For the full list of all side effects reported with GONAL-f, see the Package Leaflet.
Sometimes, the ovaries can over-respond to treatment, especially when hCG has been used (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome), and both doctors and patients must be aware of this possibility.
GONAL-f must not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to follitropin alfa, FSH, or any of the other ingredients, or in patients with tumours of the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, breast, uterus, or ovary.
It should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained (such as in patients with primary ovarian or testicular failure).
In women, it must not be used when there is ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease, or vaginal bleeding.
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
Why has GONAL-f been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that GONAL-f’ s benefits are greater than its risks for women who are anovulatory, women who need to ovulate before fertility treatment, with luteinising hormone for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency, and in men who have hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.
They recommended that GONAL-f be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about GONAL-f:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for GONAL-f to Serono Europe Limited on 20 October 1995.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 20 October 2000 and 20 October 2005.
The full EPAR for GONAL-f is available here.
