Save a File
You have opened a file that was saved with an old version of Planner.

When loading old files, all tasks will use the constraint 'Must Start On', since the old version did not fully support automatic rescheduling. To take advantage of this new feature, you should add predecessor relations between tasks that are dependent on each other.

You can add a predecessor relation by clicking on the predecessor and dragging to the successor.

After doing this, you can remove all constraints by selecting the menu item 'Remove all constraints' in the 'Edit' menu.
