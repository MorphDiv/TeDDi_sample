(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
Returns information about an existing stream.
The stream can be any stream created by fopen(), fsockopen() and pfsockopen().
The result array contains the following items:
timed_out (bool) - TRUE if the stream timed out while waiting for data on the last call to fread() or fgets().
blocked (bool) - TRUE if the stream is in blocking IO mode.
See socket_set_blocking().
eof (bool) - TRUE if the stream has reached end-of-file.
Note that for socket streams this member can be TRUE even when unread_bytes is non-zero.
To determine if there is more data to be read, use feof() instead of reading this item.
unread_bytes (int) - the number of bytes currently contained in the read buffer.
The following items were added in PHP 4.3:
stream_type (string) - a label describing the underlying implementation of the stream.
wrapper_type wrapper_type (string) - a label describing the protocol wrapper implementation layered over the stream.
See Appendix I for more information about wrappers.
wrapper_data (mixed) - wrapper specific data attached to this stream.
See Appendix I for more information about wrappers and their wrapper data.
filters (array) - and array containing the names of any filters that have been stacked onto this stream.
Filters are currently undocumented.
Note:
This function was introduced in PHP 4.3, but prior to this version, socket_get_status() could be used to retrieve the first four items, for socket based streams only.
In PHP 4.3 and later, socket_get_status() is an alias for this function.
Note:
This function does NOT work on sockets created by the Socket extension.
