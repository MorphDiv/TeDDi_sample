KDE

Introduction
This plugin can be used for batch resize images in an image collection. It use "convert" program from "ImageMagick" package. You can resize up or down the images size. 3 resizing types have been implemented:
Proportional (1 dim.): standard auto-resizing using one dimension. The width or the height of the images will be automatically selected in depending of the images orientation. The images aspect ratio are preserved.
Proportional (2 dim.): auto-resizing using two dimensions. The images aspect ratio are preserved. For example, you can use that for to adapt your images size to your screen size.
Non proportional: non proportional resizing using two dimensions. The images aspect ratio are n't preserved.
Prepare to print: prepare the image for a photographic printing. The user can set the print resolution and the photographic paper size. The target image will be adapted to the good dimensions (included the background size, margin size, and background color).
