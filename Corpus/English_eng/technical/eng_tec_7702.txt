4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Tygacil is indicated for the treatment of the following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1):
• Complicated skin and soft tissue infections • Complicated intra-abdominal infections
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose for adults is an initial dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days.
The duration of therapy should be guided by the severity, site of the infection, and the patient’ s clinical response.
Hepatic insufficiency No dosage adjustment is warranted in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A and Child Pugh B).
In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), the dose of Tygacil should be reduced to 25 mg every 12 hours following the 100 mg loading dose.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) should be treated with caution and monitored for treatment response (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
2 Renal insufficiency No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment or in patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 5.2).
Elderly patients No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients (see section 5.2).
Paediatric patients Tygacil is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see sections 5.2 and 4.4).
Method of administration:
Tygacil is administered only by intravenous infusion over 30 to 60 minutes (see section 6.6).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients hypersensitive to tetracycline class antibiotics may be hypersensitive to tigecycline.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions, potentially life-threatening, have been reported with tigecycline (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).
Glycylcycline class antibiotics are structurally similar to tetracycline class antibiotics.
Tigecycline may have adverse reactions similar to tetracycline class antibiotics.
Such reactions may include photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, pancreatitis, and anti-anabolic action which has led to increased BUN, azotaemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphataemia (see section 4.8).
Acute pancreatitis, which can be serious, has occurred (frequency: uncommon) in association with tigecycline treatment (see section 4.8).
The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be considered in patients taking tigecycline who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute pancreatitis.
Most of the reported cases developed after at least one week of treatment.
Cases have been reported in patients without known risk factors for pancreatitis.
Patients usually improve after tigecycline discontinuation.
Consideration should be given to the cessation of the treatment with tigecycline in cases suspected of having developed pancreatitis.
Experience in the use of tigecycline for treatment of infections in patients with severe underlying diseases is limited.
In clinical trials in complicated skin and soft tissue infections, the most common type of infection in tigecycline treated-patients was cellulitis (59%), followed by major abscesses (27.5%).
Patients with severe underlying disease, such as those that were immunocompromised, patients with decubitus ulcer infections, or patients that had infections requiring longer than 14 days of treatment (for example, necrotizing fasciitis), were not enrolled.
Few patients with diabetic foot infections (5%) were enrolled.
A limited number of patients were enrolled with co-morbid factors such as diabetes (20%), peripheral vascular disease (7%), intravenous drug abuse (2%), and HIV-positive infection (1%).
Limited experience is also available in treating patients with concurrent bacteraemia (3%).
Therefore, caution is advised when treating such patients.
3 In clinical trials in complicated intra-abdominal infections, the most common type of infection in tigecycline treated-patients was complicated appendicitis (51%), followed by other diagnoses less commonly reported such as complicated cholecystitis (14%), intra-abdominal abscess (10%), perforation of intestine (10%) and gastric or duodenal ulcer perforation less than 24 hours (5%).
Of these patients, 76% had associated diffuse peritonitis (surgically-apparent peritonitis).
There were a limited number of patients with severe underlying disease such as immunocompromised patients, patients with APACHE II scores > 15 (4%), or with surgically apparent multiple intra-abdominal abscesses (10%).
Limited experience is also available in treating patients with concurrent bacteraemia (6%).
Therefore, caution is advised when treating such patients.
Consideration should be given to the use of combination antibacterial therapy whenever tigecycline is to be administered to severely ill patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) secondary to clinically apparent intestinal perforation or patients with incipient sepsis or septic shock (see section 4.8).
The effect of cholestasis in the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline has not been properly established.
Biliary excretion accounts for approximately 50% of the total tigecycline excretion.
Therefore, patients presenting with cholestasis should be closely monitored.
Prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be used to monitor patients if tigecycline is administered with anticoagulants (see section 4.5).
Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild to life threatening.
Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the administration of any antibacterial agent (see section 4.8).
The use of tigecycline may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi.
Patients should be carefully monitored during therapy.
If super infection occurs, appropriate measures should be taken (see section 4.8).
Results of studies in rats with tigecycline have shown bone discolouration.
Tigecycline may be associated with permanent tooth discolouration in humans if used during tooth development (see section 4.8).
Tygacil should not be used in children under 8 years of age because of teeth discolouration, and is not recommended in adolescents below 18 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
Concomitant administration of tigecycline and warfarin (25 mg single-dose) to healthy subjects resulted in a decrease in clearance of R-warfarin and S-warfarin by 40% and 23%, and an increase in AUC by 68% and 29%, respectively.
The mechanism of this interaction is still not elucidated.
Available data does not suggest that this interaction may result in significant INR changes.
However, since tigecycline may prolong both prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the relevant coagulation tests should be closely monitored when tigecycline is co-administered with anticoagulants (see section 4.4).
Warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline.
4 Tigecycline is not extensively metabolised.
Therefore, clearance of tigecycline is not expected to be affected by active substances that inhibit or induce the activity of the CYP450 isoforms.
In vitro, tigecycline is neither a competitive inhibitor nor an irreversible inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes (see section 5.2).
Tigecycline in recommended dosage did not affect the rate or extent of absorption, or clearance of digoxin (0.5 mg followed by 0.25 mg daily) when administered in healthy adults.
Digoxin did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline.
Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary when tigecycline is administered with digoxin.
In in vitro studies, no antagonism has been observed between tigecycline and other commonly used antibiotic classes.
Concurrent use of antibiotics with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of tigecycline in pregnant women.
Results from animal studies have shown tigecycline may cause foetal harm when administered during pregnancy (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
As it is known for tetracycline class antibiotics, tigecycline may also induce permanent dental defects (discolouration and enamel defects) and a delay in ossification processes in foetuses, exposed in utero during the last half of gestation, and in children under eight years of age due to the enrichment in tissues with a high calcium turnover and formation of calcium chelate complexes (see section 4.4).
Tigecycline should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
It is not known whether this medicinal product is excreted in human milk.
In animal studies tigecycline is excreted into milk of lactating rats.
Because a potential risk to the breast-feeding infant cannot be ruled out, when treating with tigecycline, caution should be exercised and interruption of breast-feeding should be considered (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects of tigecycline on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Dizziness may occur and this may have an effect on driving and use of machines (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The total number of patients treated with tigecycline in Phase 3 clinical studies was 1415.
Adverse reactions were reported in approximately 41% of patients treated with tigecycline.
Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of patients.
In clinical trials, the most common drug-related treatment emergent adverse reactions were reversible nausea (20%) and vomiting (14%), which usually occurred early (on treatment days 1-2) and were generally mild or moderate in severity.
Adverse reactions reported with Tygacil, including clinical trials and post-marketing experience, are listed below:
Frequency categories are expressed as:
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); Common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); Very Rare (< 1/ 10,000)

Antibiotic Class Effects:
Pseudomembranous colitis which may range in severity from mild to life threatening (see section 4.4)
Overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi (see section 4.4)
Tetracycline Class Effects:
Glycylcycline class antibiotics are structurally similar to tetracycline class antibiotics.
Tetracycline class adverse reactions may include photosensitivity, pseudotumour cerebri, pancreatitis, and anti-anabolic action which has led to increased BUN, azotaemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphataemia (see section 4.4).
Tigecycline may be associated with permanent tooth discolouration if used during tooth development (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage.
Intravenous administration of tigecycline at a single dose of 300 mg over 60 minutes in healthy volunteers resulted in an increased incidence of nausea and vomiting.
Tigecycline is not removed in significant quantities by haemodialysis.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Tetracyclines, ATC code:
J01AA12.
Mode of action
Tigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic, inhibits protein translation in bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome.
This prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains.
7 In general, tigecycline is considered bacteriostatic.
At 4 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), a 2-log reduction in colony counts was observed with tigecycline against Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.
Mechanism of resistance
Tigecycline is able to overcome the two major tetracycline resistance mechanisms, ribosomal protection and efflux.
However, it is vulnerable to chromosomally-encoded multidrug efflux pumps of Proteeae (see below) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MexXY-OprM efflux system).
There is no target-based cross-resistance between tigecycline and most classes of antibiotics.
Pathogens of the family Proteeae (Proteus spp., Providencia spp., and Morganella spp.) are generally less susceptible to tigecycline than other members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
In addition, some acquired resistance has been detected in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae.
Decreased susceptibility in both groups has been attributed to the overexpression of the non-specific AcrAB multi-drug efflux pump.
Decreased susceptibility in Acinetobacter baumannii has been attributed to the overexpression of the AdeABC efflux pump.
Breakpoints
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints established by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are as follows:
Staphylococcus spp.
S ≤ 0.5 mg/ L and R > 0.5 mg/ L Streptococcus spp. other than S. pneumoniae S ≤ 0.25 mg/ L and R > 0.5 mg/ L Enterococcus spp.
S ≤ 0.25 mg/ L and R > 0.5 mg/ L Enterobacteriaceae S ≤ 1(^) mg/ L and R > 2 mg/ L (^) Tigecycline has decreased in vitro activity against Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella spp.
For anaerobic bacteria there is clinical evidence of efficacy in polymicrobial intra-abdominal infections, but no correlation between MIC values, PK/ PD data and clinical outcome.
Therefore, no breakpoint for susceptibility is given.
It should be noted that the MIC distributions for organisms of the genera Bacteroides and Clostridium are wide and may include values in excess of 2 mg/ L tigecycline.
There is limited evidence of the clinical efficacy of tigecycline against enterococci.
However, polymicrobial intra-abdominal infections have shown to respond to treatment with tigecycline in clinical trials.
Susceptibility
The prevalence of acquired resistance may vary geographically and with time for selected species, and local information on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections.
As necessary, expert advice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the agent in at least some types of infections is questionable.

5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Tigecycline is administered intravenously and therefore has 100% bioavailability.
Distribution
The in vitro plasma protein binding of tigecycline ranges from approximately 71% to 89% at concentrations observed in clinical studies (0.1 to 1.0 µg/ ml).
Animal and human pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that tigecycline readily distributes to tissues.
In rats receiving single or multiple doses of 14C-tigecycline, radioactivity was well distributed to most tissues, with the highest overall exposure observed in bone marrow, salivary glands, thyroid gland, spleen, and kidney.
In humans, the steady-state volume of distribution of tigecycline averaged 500 to 700 L (7 to 9 L/ kg), indicating that tigecycline is extensively distributed beyond the plasma volume and concentrates into tissues.
9 No data are available on whether tigecycline can cross the blood-brain barrier in humans.
In clinical pharmacology studies using the therapeutic dosage regimen of 100 mg followed by 50 mg q12h, serum tigecycline steady-state Cmax was 866±233 ng/ ml for 30-minute infusions and 634±97 ng/ ml for 60-minute infusions.
The steady-state AUC0-12h was 2349±850 ng• h/ ml.
Metabolism
On average, it is estimated that less than 20% of tigecycline is metabolised before excretion.
In healthy male volunteers, following the administration of 14C-tigecycline, unchanged tigecycline was the primary 14 C-labelled material recovered in urine and faeces, but a glucuronide, an N-acetyl metabolite and a tigecycline epimer were also present.
In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tigecycline does not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following 6 cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms:
1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 by competitive inhibition.
In addition, tigecycline did not show NADPH-dependency in the inhibition of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A, suggesting the absence of mechanism-based inhibition of these CYP enzymes.
Elimination
The recovery of the total radioactivity in faeces and urine following administration of 14C-tigecycline indicates that 59% of the dose is eliminated by biliary/ faecal excretion, and 33% is excreted in urine.
Overall, the primary route of elimination for tigecycline is biliary excretion of unchanged tigecycline.
Glucuronidation and renal excretion of unchanged tigecycline are secondary routes.
The total clearance of tigecycline is 24 L/ h after intravenous infusion.
Renal clearance is approximately 13% of total clearance.
Tigecycline shows a polyexponential elimination from serum with a mean terminal elimination half-life after multiple doses of 42 hours although high interindividual variability exists.
Special populations
Hepatic Insufficiency The single-dose pharmacokinetic disposition of tigecycline was not altered in patients with mild hepatic impairment.
However, systemic clearance of tigecycline was reduced by 25% and 55% and the half-life of tigecycline was prolonged by 23% and 43% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B and C), respectively (see section 4.2).
Renal Insufficiency The single dose pharmacokinetic disposition of tigecycline was not altered in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min, n=6).
In severe renal impairment, AUC was 30% higher than in subjects with normal renal function (see section 4.2).
Elderly Patients No overall differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between healthy elderly subjects and younger subjects (see section 4.2).
10 Paediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in patients less than 18 years of age has not been established (see section 4.2).
Gender There were no clinically relevant differences in the clearance of tigecycline between men and women.
AUC was estimated to be 20% higher in females than in males.
Race There were no differences in the clearance of tigecycline based on race.
Weight Clearance, weight-normalised clearance, and AUC were not appreciably different among patients with different body weights, including those weighing ≥ 125 kg.
AUC was 24% lower in patients weighing ≥ 125 kg.
No data is available for patients weighing 140 kg and more.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, lymphoid depletion/ atrophy of lymph nodes, spleen and thymus, decreased erythrocytes, reticulocytes, leukocytes, and platelets, in association with bone marrow hypocellularity, and adverse renal and gastrointestinal effects have been seen with tigecycline at exposures of 8 and 10 times the human daily dose based on AUC in rats and dogs, respectively.
These alterations were shown to be reversible after two weeks of dosing.
Bone discolouring was observed in rats which was not reversible after two weeks of dosing.
Results of animal studies indicate that tigecycline crosses the placenta and is found in foetal tissues.
In reproduction toxicity studies, decreased foetal weights in rats and rabbits (with associated delays in ossification) and foetal loss in rabbits have been observed with tigecycline.
Tigecycline was not teratogenic in the rat or rabbit.
Results from animal studies using 14C-labelled tigecycline indicate that tigecycline is excreted readily via the milk of lactating rats.
Consistent with the limited oral bioavailability of tigecycline, there is little or no systemic exposure to tigecycline in the nursing pups as a result of exposure via maternal milk.
Lifetime studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of tigecycline have not been performed, but short-term genotoxicity studies of tigecycline were negative.
Bolus intravenous administration of tigecycline has been associated with a histamine response in animal studies.
These effects were observed at exposures of 14 and 3 times the human daily dose based on the AUC in rats and dogs respectively.
No evidence of photosensitivity was observed in rats following administration of tigecycline.

Further Information
1.
WHAT TYGACIL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Tygacil is an antibiotic of the glycylcycline group that works by stopping the growth of bacteria that cause infections.
Your doctor prescribed Tygacil because you have one of the following types of serious infections:
• Complicated infection of the skin and soft tissues • Complicated infection in the abdomen
2.
BEFORE YOU RECEIVE TYGACIL
Do not use Tygacil • If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to tigecycline, the active substance of Tygacil.
If you are allergic to tetracycline class antibiotics (e. g., minocycline, doxycycline, etc.), you may be allergic to tigecycline.
Take special care with Tygacil • Tell your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms of an allergic reaction. • Tell your doctor immediately if you develop severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
These may be symptoms of acute pancreatitis. • Tell your doctor if you are suffering from diarrhoea before you are given Tygacil.
If you develop diarrhoea during or after your treatment, tell your doctor at once.
Do not take any diarrhoea medicine without first checking with your doctor. • Tell your doctor if you have or previously had any side effects due to antibiotics belonging to the tetracycline class (e. g., skin sensitization to sun light, staining on developing teeth, pancreas inflammation, and alteration of certain laboratory values aimed at measuring how well your blood clots).
22 • In certain serious infections, your doctor may consider to use Tygacil in combination with other antibiotics. • Tell your doctor if you are taking certain medicines (named anticoagulants) aimed at avoiding an excess of blood clotting (see also Using other medicines in this leaflet). • Tell your doctor if you are taking the contraceptive pill as you may need an additional method of contraception while receiving Tygacil (see also Using other medicines in this leaflet). • Tell your doctor if you have, or previously had liver problems.
Depending on the condition of your liver, your doctor may reduce the dose to avoid potential side effects. • While antibiotics including Tygacil fight certain bacteria, other bacteria and fungi may continue to grow.
This is called overgrowth.
Your doctor will monitor you for any potential infections and treat you if necessary. • Tygacil is not to be used in children or adolescents (under 18 years of age).
In children less than 8 years, tigecycline may induce permanent dental defects such as staining on the developing teeth.
Using other medicines Always tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines you buy without a prescription.
Tygacil may prolong certain tests that measure how well your blood is clotting.
It is important that you tell your doctor if you are taking medicines to avoid an excess of blood clotting.
If this were the case, your doctor will monitor you closely.
Tygacil may interfere with the contraceptive pill (birth control pill).
Talk to your doctor about the need for an additional method of contraception while receiving Tygacil.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tygacil may cause foetal harm.
If you are pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, talk to your doctor before receiving Tygacil.
It is not known if Tygacil passes into breast milk in humans.
Ask your doctor for advice before breast-feeding your baby.
Driving and using machines Tygacil may cause side effects such as dizziness.
This may impair your ability to drive or operate machinery.

Instructions for use and handling (see also 3.
HOW TYGACIL IS GIVEN in this leaflet)
The lyophilised powder should be reconstituted with 5.3 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution for injection to achieve a concentration of 10 mg/ ml of tigecycline.
The vial should be gently swirled until the active substance is dissolved.
Thereafter, 5 ml of the reconstituted solution should be immediately withdrawn from the vial and added to a 100 ml intravenous bag for infusion or other suitable infusion container (e. g. glass bottle).
For a 100 mg dose, reconstitute using two vials into a 100 ml intravenous bag for infusion or other suitable infusion container (e. g. glass bottle).
Note:
The vial contains a 6% overage.
Thus, 5 ml of reconstituted solution is equivalent to 50 mg of the active substance.
The reconstituted solution should be yellow to orange in colour; if not, the solution should be discarded.
Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration (e. g. green or black) prior to administration.
Tygacil may be administered intravenously through a dedicated line or through a Y-site.
If the same intravenous line is used for sequential infusion of several active substances, the line should be flushed before and after infusion of Tygacil with either sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection or dextrose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution for injection.
Injection should be made with an infusion solution compatible with tigecycline and any other medicinal product(s) via this common line.
Compatible intravenous solutions include: sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection and dextrose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution for injection.
When administered through a Y-site, compatibility of Tygacil diluted in sodium chloride 0.9% for injection is demonstrated with the following medicinal products or diluents: amikacin, dobutamine, dopamine HCl, gentamicin, haloperidol, Lactated Ringer’ s, lidocaine HCl, morphine, norepinephrine, piperacillin/ tazobactam (EDTA formulation), potassium chloride, propofol, ranitidine HCl, theophylline, and tobramycin.
Once reconstituted and diluted in the bag or other suitable infusion container (e. g. glass bottle) tigecycline should be used immediately.
For single use only, any unused solution should be discarded.
