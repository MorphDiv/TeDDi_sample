& kwrite; is a text editor for & kde; allowing you to edit one file at the time per window.
KDE
KWrite
text
editor
Introduction
& kwrite; is more than a text editor for the & kde; Desktop. It is meant to be a programmer's editor, and could be considered as at least a partial alternative to more powerful editors. It may be best used in conjunction with & konqueror; or & dolphin; for source file browsing for different languages. & kwrite; also works very well as a simple text editor. One of & kwrite; 's main features is the colorized syntax, customized for many different programming languages such as: C/ C++, & Java;, Python, Perl, Bash, Modula 2, & HTML;, and Ada.
& kwrite; has a single document interface (SDI) allowing you to edit one file at the time per window.
& kappname; features two different modes, a simple mode with a straightforward interface and an advanced mode with more features and more extensive menu items. The advanced mode is enabled by checking the option Enable power user mode (kde; 3 mode) on the Appearance page in & kappname; s settings.
Some Fundamentals
& kwrite; is very simple to use. Anyone that has used a text editor should have no problems.
Drag and Drop
& kwrite; uses the & kde; Drag and Drop protocol. Files may be dragged and dropped onto & kwrite; from the Desktop, the filemanager & dolphin;, or some remote & FTP; site opened in one of & dolphin; 's windows.
Command Line Options
Though & kwrite; may most often be started from the & kde; program menu, or a desktop icon, it can also be opened at the command line prompt of a terminal window. There are a few useful options that are available when doing this.
Specify a File
By specifying the path and name of a particular file the user can have & kwrite; open (or create) that file immediately upon startup. This option might look something like the following:
% kwrite / home/ myhome/ docs/ myfile. txt
Specify a file on the Internet
The above-mentioned method could even be used to open files on the Internet (if the user has an active connection at the time.) An example of this might look like the following:
% kwrite ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde/ README
Other Command Line Options
The following command line help options are available
kwrite --help
This lists the most basic options available at the command line.
kwrite --help-qt
This lists the options available for changing the way & kwrite; interacts with & Qt;.
kwrite --help-kde
This lists the options available for changing the way & kwrite; interacts with & kde;.
kwrite --help-all
This lists all of the command line options.
kwrite --author
Lists & kwrite; 's authors in the terminal window
kwrite -v, --version
Lists version information for & Qt;, & kde;, and & kwrite;. Also available through kwrite -v
kwrite; --license
Shows license information.
kwrite --stdin
Causes & kwrite; to read the document content from STDIN. This is similar to the common option - used in many command line programs, and allows you to pipe command output into & kwrite;.
kwrite --encoding encoding URL;
Causes & kwrite; to use the specified encoding for the document.
kwrite --line line URL;
Navigate to the specified line after opening the document.
kwrite --column column URL;
Navigate to the specified column after opening the document.
Shortcuts
Many of the shortcuts are configurable by way of the Settings menu. By default & kwrite; honors the following shortcuts:
Insert
Toggle between Insert and Overwrite mode. When in insert mode the editor will add any typed characters to the text while pushing along any data to the right of the text cursor. Overwrite mode causes the entry of each character to eliminate the character immediately to the right of the text cursor.
Left Arrow
Move the cursor one character to the left
Right Arrow
Move the cursor one character to the right
Up Arrow
Move the cursor up one line
Down Arrow
Move the cursor down one line
Page Up
Move the cursor up one page
& Alt; Page Up
Previous Bookmark
Page Down
Move the cursor down one page
& Alt; Page Down
Next Bookmark
Backspace
Delete the character to the left of the cursor
Home
Move the cursor to the beginning of the line
End
Move the cursor to the end of the line
Delete
Delete the character to the right of the cursor (or any selected text)
& Shift; Enter
Insert newline including leading characters of the current line which are not letters or numbers. It is useful & eg; to write comments in the code: At the end of the line / / some text press this shortcut and the next line starts already with / /. So you do not have to enter the comment characters at the beginning of each new line with comments.
& Shift; Left Arrow
Mark text one character to the left
& Shift; Right Arrow
Mark text one character to the right

The Menu Entries
There are different menus and menu items in simple and advanced mode. The advanced mode is enabled by checking the option Enable power user mode (kde; 3 mode) on the Appearance page in & kappname; s settings.
The File Menu
Ctrl; N File New
This starts a new document in a new and independent editor window.
Ctrl; O File Open...
Displays a standard & kde; Open File dialog. Use the file view to select the file you want to open, and click on Open to open it. You can find more information about the & kde; Open File dialog in the & kde; User Guide.
File Open Recent
This is a shortcut to open recently saved documents. Clicking on this item opens a list to the side of the menu with several of the most recently saved files. Clicking on a specific file will open it in & kappname; - if the file still resides at the same location.
Ctrl; S File Save
This saves the current document. If there has already been a save of the document then this will overwrite the previously saved file without asking for the user's consent. If it is the first save of a new document the save as dialog (described below) will be invoked.
File Save As...
This allows a document to be saved with a new file name. This is done by means of the file dialog box described above in the Open section of this help file.
F5 File Reload
Reloads the active file from disk. This command is useful if another program or process has changed the file while you have it open in & kappname;.
Ctrl; P File Print...
Opens a simple print dialog allowing the user to specify what, where, and how to print.
File Export as HTML
Export your file in & HTML; format so your document can be viewed as a web page.
Ctrl; W File Close
Close the active file with this command. If you have made unsaved changes, you will be prompted to save the file before & kappname; closes it.
Ctrl; Q File Quit
This will close the editor window, if you have more than one instance of & kappname; running, through the New or New Window menu items, those instances will not be closed.
The Edit Menu
Ctrl; Z Edit Undo
This is used to eliminate or reverse the most recent user action or operation.
Ctrl; Shift; Z Edit Redo
This will reverse the most recent change (if any) made using Undo
Ctrl; X Edit Cut
This command deletes the current selection and places it on the clipboard. The clipboard is a feature of & kde; that works invisibly to provide a way to transfer data between applications.
Ctrl; C Edit Copy
This copies the currently selected text to the clipboard so that it may be pasted elsewhere. The clipboard is a feature of & kde; that works invisibly to provide a way to transfer data between applications.
Edit Copy as HTML...
This copies the currently selected text to the clipboard as & HTML;.
Ctrl; V Edit Paste
This will insert the contents of the clipboard at the cursor position. The clipboard is feature of & kde; that works invisibly to provide a way to transfer data between applications.
Ctrl; A Edit
This will select the entire document. This could be very useful for copying the entire file to another application.
Ctrl; Shift; A Edit Deselect
Deselects the selected text in the editor if any.
Ctrl; Shift; B Edit
Toggles Selection Mode. When the Selection Mode is BLOCK, you can make vertical selections, & eg; select column 5 to 10 in lines 9 to 15. The status bar shows the current state of the Selection Mode, either BLOCK or LINE.
Meta Ctrl; V Edit
Switch to a vi-like, modal editing mode. This mode supports the most used commands and motions from vim's normal and visual mode and has an optional vi mode statusbar. This status bar shows commands while they are being entered, output from commands and the current mode. The behavior of this mode can be configured in the Vi Input Mode section of the Editing page in & kappname; 's settings dialog.
Ins Edit
Toggles the Insert/ Overwrite modes. When the mode is INS, you insert characters where the cursor is. When the mode is OVR, writing characters will replace the current characters if your cursor is positioned before any character. The status bar shows the current state of the Overwrite Mode, either INS or OVR.
Ctrl; F Edit Find...
This opens the incremental search bar at the bottom of the editor window. On the left side of the bar is an icon to close the bar, followed by a small text box for entering the search pattern.
When you start entering characters of your search pattern, the search starts immediately. If there is a match in the text this is highlighted and the background color of the entry field changes to light green. If the search pattern does not match any string in the text, this is indicated by a light red background color of the entry field and Not found is displayed at the right side of the bar.
Use the Next or Previous button to jump to the next or previous match in the document.
You can modify the search behavior by selecting different Options: The Highlight all option highlights all matches in the document. Selecting Match case will limit finds to entries that match the case (upper or lower) of each of the characters in the search pattern. The From cursor option begins the search from the current position of the cursor within the document rather than from the beginning.
Click on the green arrow icon at the right side of the incremental search bar to switch to the power search and replace bar.
F3 Edit Find Next
This repeats the last find operation, if any, without calling the incremental search bar.
Shift; F3 Edit Find Previous
This repeats the last find operation, if any, without calling the incremental search bar, and searching backwards instead of forwards through the document.
Ctrl; R Edit Replace...
This command opens the power search and replace bar. On the upper left side of the bar is an icon to close the bar, followed by a small text box for entering the search pattern.
You can control the search mode by selecting Plain text Alt; 1, Whole words Alt; 2, Escape sequences Alt; 3 or Regular expression Alt; 4.
If Escape sequences or Regular expression are selected, the Add... menuitem at the bottom of the context menu of the text boxes will be enabled and allows you to add escape sequences or regular expression items to the search or replace pattern from predefined lists.
Enter the text to replace with in the text box labeled Replace and click the Replace button to replace only the highlighted text or the Replace All button to replace the search text in the whole document.
You can modify the search and replace behavior by selecting different options on the right side of the bar. The Highlight all option highlights all matches in the document. Selecting Match case will limit finds to entries that match the case (upper or lower) of each of the characters in the search pattern. The From cursor option begins the search from the current position of the cursor within the document rather than from the beginning. Selection only will search and replace within the current selection only.
Click on the green arrow icon at the right side of the power search and replace bar to switch to the incremental search bar.
Ctrl; H Edit Find Selected
Finds next occurrence of selected text.
Ctrl; Shift; H Edit Find Selected Backwards
Finds previous occurrence of selected text.
Ctrl; G Edit Go to Line...
This opens the goto line bar at the bottom of the window which is used to have the cursor jump to a particular line (specified by number) in the document. The line number may be entered directly into the text box or graphically by clicking on the up or down arrow spin controls at the side of the text box. The little up arrow will increase the line number and the down arrow decrease it. Close the bar with a click on the icon on the left side of the bar.

Tools Spelling...
This initiates the spellchecking program - a program designed to help the user catch and correct any spelling errors. Clicking on this entry will start the checker and bring up the speller dialog box through which the user can control the process. There are four settings lined up vertically in the center of the dialog with their corresponding labels just to the left. Starting at the top they are:
Unknown word:
Here, the spellchecker indicates the word currently under consideration. This happens when the checker encounters a word not in its dictionary - a file containing a list of correctly spelled words against which it compares each word in the editor.
Replace with:
If the checker has any similar words in its dictionary the first one will be listed here. The user can accept the suggestion, type in his or her own correction, or choose a different suggestion from the next box.
Language:
If you have installed multiple dictionaries, here you can select which dictionary/ language should be used.
On the right side of the dialog box are 6 buttons that allow the user to control the spellcheck process. They are:
Add to Dictionary
Pressing this button adds the Unknown word to the checker's dictionary. This means that in the future the checker will always consider this word to be correctly spelled.
Suggest
The checker may list here a number of possible replacements for the word under consideration. Clicking on any one of the suggestions will cause that word to be entered in the Replace with box, above.
Replace
This button has the checker replace the word under consideration in the document with the word in the Replace with box.
Replace All
This button causes the checker to replace not only the current Unknown word: but to automatically make the same substitution for any other occurrences of this Unknown word in the document.
Ignore
Activating this button will have the checker move on without making any changes.
Ignore All
This button tells the checker to do nothing with the current Unknown word: and to pass over any other instances of the same word.
This only applies to the current spellcheck run. If the checker is run again later it will stop on this same word.
Three more buttons are located horizontally along the bottom of the spellcheck dialog. They are:
Help
This invokes the & kde; help system starting at the & kappname; help pages (this document).
Finished
This button ends the spellcheck process, and returns to the document.
Cancel
This button cancels the spellcheck process, all modifications are reverted, and you will return to your document.
Tools Spelling (from cursor)...
This initiates the spellchecking program but it starts where your cursor is instead of at the beginning of the document.
Tools Spellcheck Selection...
Spellchecks the current selection.
Ctrl; I Tools Indent
This increases the paragraph's indentation by one step. The size of the step depends on the indentation settings.
Ctrl; Shift; I Tools Unindent
This reduces the paragraph's indentation by one step. The size of the step depends on the indentation settings.
Tools Clean Indentation
This cleans the indentation for the current selection or for the line the cursor is currently in. Cleaning the indentation ensures that all your selected text follows the indentation mode you choose.
Tools Align
Causes a realign of the current line or selected lines using the indentation mode and indentation settings in the document.
Ctrl; D Tools Comment
This adds one space to the beginning of the line where the text cursor is located or to the beginning of any selected lines.
Ctrl; Shift; D Tools Uncomment
This removes one space (if any exist) from the beginning of the line where the text cursor is located or from the beginning of any selected lines.
Ctrl; U Tools Uppercase
Put the selected text or the letter after the cursor in uppercase.
Ctrl; Shift; U Tools Lowercase
Put the selected text or the letter after the cursor in lowercase.
Alt; Ctrl; U Tools Capitalize
Capitalize the selected text or the current word.
Ctrl; J Tools
Joins the selected lines, or the current line and the line below with one white space character as a separator. Leading/ trailing white space on joined lines is removed in the affected ends.
Tools Word Wrap Document
Apply static word wrapping on all the document. That means that a new line of text will automatically start when the current line exceeds the length specified by the Wrap words at option in the Editing tab in Settings Configure Editor...
Menu items for the selected plugins are displayed at the end of this menu
The Settings Menu
Settings Show Statusbar
When checked, this displays a small bar at the bottom of the editor containing information about the status of the current document. When unchecked the status bar is hidden.
Settings Show Toolbar
When checked, this displays a movable toolbar containing buttons used to initiate frequently used commands. When unchecked the toolbar is hidden.
Settings Show Path
When selected, this displays in the titlebar the path (its location in the file system) of the current document. When unchecked the path is hidden.
Settings Configure Editor...
This menu item opens a dialog whereby several different settings may be adjusted.
Settings Configure Shortcuts...
This command opens a dialog box whereby the shortcuts may be changed. A display window shows the list of commands (actions) and their assigned shortcuts, alternates and global shortcuts. The Search line above the list window is used to filter the shortcut list. Selecting an action with a & LMB; click (either on the action name or shortcut cell for the default shortcut or on the alternate cell for an alternative) displays the Default and Custom radio buttons below the selected action.
To assign or change a shortcut click on the None button. Its label changes then to Input, now press the new key combination for the action.
For example, with the About & kde; action selected in the display window, press the & Ctrl;, & Alt; and the K key on the keyboard. This would mean that anytime you hold down the & Ctrl; and & Alt; buttons and pressed K (while using & kappname;) the About & kde; display box would be called.
Use the buttons at the bottom of the dialog to set all shortcuts back to their defaults, print the shortcut list or cancel all changes. Click the OK button to close the dialog and accept all changes.
Settings Configure Toolbars...
This will open the dialog whereby the toolbar configuration may be changed. The user can choose which shortcut buttons should appear on the toolbar. A display window on the left lists the commands available to placed on the toolbar. A display on the right lists those commands already on the toolbar. A set of four arrow buttons between the two displays manipulates the selections. The right pointing arrow places any command selected in the left pane onto the right pane, i. e., it is added to the toolbar. The left arrow does just the opposite, removing any action selected in the right window from the toolbar. The up and down pointing arrows change the position of an action selected in the right window which changes the position of its button in the toolbar.
The Help Menu
& help. menu. documentation;
Configure & kappname;
Selecting Settings Configure Editor... from the menu brings up the Configure Editor dialog box. This dialog can be used to alter a number of different settings. The settings available for change vary according to which category the user chooses from a vertical list on the left side of the dialog. By means of three buttons along the bottom of the box the user can control the process.
You may invoke the Help system, accept the current settings and close the dialog by means of the OK button, or Cancel the process. The categories Appearance, Fonts & Colors, Editing, Open/ Save and Extensions are detailed below.
Appearance
Word Wrap
Dynamic Word Wrap
If this option is checked, the text lines will be wrapped at the view border on the screen.
Dynamic word wrap indicators (if applicable)
Choose when the Dynamic word wrap indicators should be displayed.
Align dynamically wrapped lines to indentation depth:
Enables the start of dynamically wrapped lines to be aligned vertically to the indentation level of the first line. This can help to make code and markup more readable.
Additionally, this allows you to set a maximum width of the screen, as a percentage, after which dynamically wrapped lines will no longer be vertically aligned. For example, at 50%, lines whose indentation levels are deeper than 50% of the width of the screen will not have vertical alignment applied to subsequent wrapped lines.
Borders
Show folding markers (if available)
If this option is checked, the current view will display marks for code folding, if code folding is available.
Show icon border
If this is checked, you will see an icon border on the left hand side. The icon border shows bookmark signs for instance.
Show line numbers
If this is checked, you will see line numbers on the left hand side.
Show scrollbar marks
If this option is checked the current view will show marks on the vertical scrollbar. These marks will for instance show bookmarks.
Sort Bookmarks Menu
These options are only displayed, if Enable power user mode (kde; 3 mode) in the next section is checked.
By position
The bookmarks will be ordered by the line numbers they are placed at.
By creation
Each new bookmark will be added to the bottom, independently from where it is placed in the document.
Advanced
Enable power user mode (kde; 3 mode)
Switch between simple and advanced mode. Changing this mode affects only newly opened / created documents. In & kappname; a restart is recommended.
Show indentation lines
If this is checked, the editor will display vertical lines to help identifying indent lines.
Highlight range between selected brackets
If this is enabled, the range between the selected matching brackets will be highlighted.
Fonts & Colors
This section of the dialog lets you configure all fonts and colors in any color scheme you have, as well creating new schemes or deleting existing ones. Each scheme has settings for colors, fonts and normal and highlight text styles.
& kappname; will preselect the currently active scheme for you, if you want to work on a different scheme start by selecting that from the Schema combobox. With the New and Delete button you can create a new scheme or delete existing ones.
At the bottom of the page you can select the Default schema for & kappname;.
Colors
Text Area Background
Normal text
This is the default background for the editor area, it will be the dominant color on the editor area.
Selected text
This is the background for selected text. The default is the global selection color, as set in your & kde; color preferences.
Current line
Set the color for the current line. Setting this a bit different from the Normal text background helps to keep focus on the current line.
Bookmark
This combobox lets you set overlay colors for various mark types. The color is mixed into the background color of a marked line, so that a line with more marks or a marked line that is current has a background that is a mix of more colors. The mark colors are also used if you enable display of scrollbar marks.
Additional Elements
Left border background
This color is used for the marks, line numbers and folding marker borders in the left side of the editor view when they are displayed.
Line numbers
This color is used to draw the line numbers on the left side of the view when displayed.
Bracket highlight
This color is used to draw the background of matching brackets.
Word wrap markers
This color is used to draw a pattern to the left of dynamically wrapped lines when those are aligned vertically, as well as for the static word wrap marker.
Tab and space markers
This color is used to draw white space indicators when enabled.
Fonts
Here you can choose the font for the schema. You can choose from any font available on your system, and set a default size. A sample text displays at the bottom of the dialog, so you can see the effect of your choices.
Normal Text Styles
The normal text styles are inherited by the highlight text styles, allowing the editor to present text in a very consistent way, for example comment text is using the same style in almost all of the text formats that & kappname; can highlight.
The name in the list of styles is using the style configured for the item, providing you with an immediate preview when configuring a style.
Each style lets you select common attributes as well as foreground and background colors. To unset a background color, rightclick to use the context menu.
Highlighting Text Styles
Here you can edit the text styles used by a specific highlight definition. The editor preselects the highlight used by your current document. To work on a different highlight, select one in the Highlight combobox above the style list.
Each style lets you select common attributes as well as foreground and background colors. To unset a background color, rightclick to use the context menu. In addition you can see if a style is equal to the default style used for the item, and set it to that if not.
You will notice that many highlights contain other highlights represented by groups in the style list. For example most highlights import the Alert highlight, and many source code formats imports the Doxygen highlight. Editing colors in those groups only affects the styles when used in the edited highlight format.
Editing
General
Tabulators
Insert spaces instead of tabulators
When this is enabled the editor will insert a calculated number of spaces according to the position in the text and the tab-width setting when you press the & Tab; key.
Highlight tabulators
When this is enabled & kappname; will display a small dot as a visual representation of tabulator characters.
This also causes dots to be drawn to indicate trailing white space. This will be fixed in a future version of & kappname;
Tab width
If the Insert spaces instead of tabulators option is selected this entry determines the number of spaces with which the editor will automatically replace tabs.
Static Word Wrap
Word wrap is a feature that causes the editor to automatically start a new line of text and move (wrap) the cursor to the beginning of that new line. & kappname; will automatically start a new line of text when the current line reaches the length specified by the Wrap Words At: option.
Enable static word wrap
Turns static word wrap on or off.
Show static word wrap markers (if applicable)
Wrap words at:
If the Enable static word wrap option is selected this entry determines the length (in characters) at which the editor will automatically start a new line.
Misc
Remove trailing spaces
& kappname; will automatically eliminate extra spaces at the ends of lines of text.
Highlight trailing spaces
& kappname; will highlight extra spaces at the ends of lines of text.
Auto brackets
When the user types a left bracket ([, (, or {) & kappname; automatically enters the right bracket (},), or]) to the right of the cursor.

When selected, pressing the home key will cause the cursor to skip white space and go to the start of a line's text.
Wrap cursor
When on, moving the insertion cursor using the Left and Right keys will go on to previous/ next line at beginning/ end of the line, similar to most editors.
When off, the insertion cursor cannot be moved left of the line start, but it can be moved off the line end, which can be very handy for programmers. When this option is chosen, moving the cursor with the arrow keys off the end of a line (to the right) causes it to jump down to the beginning of the next line. Likewise when the cursor is moved past the beginning of a line (to the left) it jumps up to the end of the preceding line. When this option is not selected, moving the cursor right past the end of a line merely causes it to continue horizontally in the same line and trying to move it left past the beginning does nothing.
PageUp/ PageDown moves cursor
This option changes the behavior of the cursor when the user presses the Page Up or Page Down key. If unselected the text cursor will maintain its relative position within the visible text in & kappname; as new text becomes visible as a result of the operation. So if the cursor is in the middle of the visible text when the operation occurs it will remain there (except when one reaches the beginning or end.) With this option selected, the first key press will cause the cursor to move to either the top or bottom of the visible text as a new page of text is displayed.
Autocenter cursor (lines):
Sets the number of lines to maintain visible above and below the cursor when possible.
Text Selection Mode
Normal
Selections will be overwritten by typed text and will be lost on cursor movement.
Persistent
Selections will stay even after cursor movement and typing.
Indentation
Default Indentation mode:
Select the automatic indentation mode you want to use as default. It is strongly recommended to use None or Normal here, and use filetype configurations to set other indentation modes for text formats like C/ C++ code or & XML;.
Indentation Properties
Indentation width:
The indentation width is the number of spaces which is used to indent a line. If the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators on the General tab in the Editing page is disabled, a & Tab; character is inserted if the indentation is divisible by the tab width.
Keep Extra Spaces
If this option is disabled, changing the indentation level aligns a line to a multiple of the width specified in Indentation width.
Adjust indentation of code pasted from the clipboard
If this option is selected, pasted code from the clipboard is indented. Triggering the Undo action removes the indentation.
Indentation Actions
Backspace key in leading blank space unindents
If this option is selected, the Backspace key decreases the indentation level if the cursor is located in the leading blank space of a line.
Tab key action (if no selection exists)
If you want & Tab; to align the current line in the current code block like in emacs, make & Tab; a shortcut to the action Align.
Always advance to the next tab position
If this option is selected, the & Tab; key always inserts white space so that the next tab position is reached. If the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators on the General tab in the Editing page is enabled, spaces are inserted; otherwise, a single tabulator is inserted.
Always increase indentation level
If this option is selected, the & Tab; key always indents the current line by the number of character positions specified in Indentation width.
Increase indentation level if in leading blank space
If this option is selected, the & Tab; key either indents the current line or advances to the next tab position. If the insertion point is at or before the first non-space character in the line, or if there is a selection, the current line is indented by the number of character positions specified in Indentation width. If the insertion point is located after the first non-space character in the line and there is no selection, white space is inserted so that the next tab position is reached: if the option Insert spaces instead of tabulators on the General tab in the Editing page is enabled, spaces are inserted; otherwise, a single tabulator is inserted.
Auto Completion
General
Auto Completion enabled
If this is enabled, the editor will calculate the number of spaces up to the next tab position as defined by the tab width, and insert that number of spaces instead of a & Tab; character.
Vi Input Mode
Use the VI Input mode
When selected, the vi input mode will be enabled when opening a new view. You can still toggle the vi input mode on/ off for a particular view in the Edit menu.
Let VI commands override Kate shortcuts
When selected, vi commands will override & kate; 's built-in commands. For example: Ctrl; R will redo, and override the standard action (showing the search and replace dialog).
Hide the VI mode status bar
By default, an extra status bar will be used when the Vi input mode is enabled. This status bar shows commands while they are being typed and messages/ errors produced by Vi commands.
Checking this options will hide this extra status line.
Open & Save
File Format
Encoding:
This sets the default character encoding for your files.
Encoding autodetection
Select an item from the drop down box, either to disable autodetection or use Universal to enable autodetection for all encodings. But as this may probably only detect utf-8/ utf-16, selecting a region will use custom heuristics for better results.
End of line:
Choose your preferred end of line mode for your active document. You have the choice between & UNIX;, DOS/ Windows; or Macintosh.
Automatic end of line detection
Check this if you want the editor to autodetect the end of line type. The first found end of line type will be used for the whole file.
Automatic Cleanups on Load/ Save
The editor will automatically eliminate extra spaces at the ends of lines of text while loading/ saving the file.
Advanced
Folder Config File
Search depth for config file:
The editor will search the given number of folder levels upwards for & kappname; config file and load the settings line from it.
Backup on Save
Backing up on save will cause & kappname; to copy the disk file to & lt; prefixgt; lt; filenamegt; lt; suffixgt; before saving changes. The suffix defaults to ~ and prefix is empty by default.
Local files
Check this if you want backups of local files when saving.
Remote files
Check this if you want backups of remote files when saving.
Prefix
Enter the prefix to prepend to the backup file names.
Suffix
Enter the suffix to add to the backup file names.
Modes & Filetypes
This page allows you to override the default configuration for documents of specified mimetypes. When the editor loads a document, it will try if it matches the file masks or mimetypes for one of the defined filetypes, and if so apply the variables defined. If more filetypes match, the one with the highest priority will be used.
Filetype:
The filetype with the highest priority is the one displayed in the first drop down box. If more filetypes were found, they are also listed.
New
This is used to create a new filetype. After you click on this button, the fields below get empty and you can fill the properties you want for the new filetype.
Delete
To remove an existing filetype, select it from the drop down box and press the Delete button.
Properties of current filetype
Name:
The name of the filetype will be the text of the corresponding menu item. This name is displayed in the Tools Filetypes
Section:
The section name is used to organize the file types in menus. This is also used in the Tools Filetypes menu.
Variables:
This string allows you to configure & kappname; 's settings for the files selected by this mimetype using & kappname; variables. You can set almost any configuration option, such as highlight, indent-mode, encoding, etc.
For a full list of known variables, see the manual.
Highlighting:
If you create a new file type, this drop down box allows you to select a filetype for highlighting.
File extensions:
The wildcards mask allows you to select files by filename. A typical mask uses an asterisk and the file extension, for example *. txt; *. text. The string is a semicolon-separated list of masks.
MIME types:
Displays a wizard that helps you easily select mimetypes.
Priority:
Sets a priority for this file type. If more than one file type selects the same file, the one with the highest priority will be used.

F10 View
& kwrite; is a text editor for & kde;
Find again
& Alt; Ctrl; U
This starts a new Document in the editor. If there is a current document with unsaved changes the user is given a chance to save it.
This opens the find dialog which is used to specify the Text to Find in the document. There is small text box for entering the search pattern which also doubles as a dropdown box. Clicking on the dropdown arrow at the side of the box makes available other recent search patterns. Other parameters are included to make the search more efficient. Selecting Case Sensitive will limit finds to entries that match the case (upper or lower) of each of the characters in the search pattern. Find Backwards directs the search to proceed in an upwardly direction. The Selected Text option keeps the search within currently selected text. Checking Whole Words Only prevents the search from stopping on words that contain the searched for pattern. The Search from Cursor option begins the search from the current position of the cursor within the document rather than from the beginning.
This command opens the replace dialog box. The replace dialog is almost identical to the above-mentioned find dialog. In addition to the features in the find dialog it contains a Replace With: text entry/ dropdown box. Using this dialog the user can specify both the text to be found and text with which to replace it. The additional Prompt On Replace option allows the user to have & kwrite; ask for confirmation before each replacement.
Code Folding
Tools Filletype
Settings Choose Editor...
This command opens a dialog box whereby the shortcuts may be changed. A display window at the top of the dialog box shows the list of commands (actions) that can have keyboard shortcuts. Below the display are three radio buttons. The user may choose between No Key, Default Key, and Custom Key. (Note that a set of radio buttons only allows the selection of one of the offered items - in the way that buttons on a car radio only offer the selection of one preset station. Also, the Default Key selection is only available for those commands that actually have a'default 'shortcut.) Selecting the Custom Key option activates the three check boxes and key button at the bottom of the dialog. The user may then select a key combination for the command in question by means of the check boxes and key button. For example, with the About & kde; command selected in the display window, the user could select & Ctrl; and & Alt;, click on the key button, and then press the K key on the keyboard. This would mean that anytime he or she held down the & Ctrl; and & Alt; buttons and pressed K (while using & kwrite;) the About & kde; display box would be called.
Remove Trailing Spaces
Maximum undo steps:
Here the user may specify the number of steps & kwrite; will retain in memory for purposes of undoing entries and actions. This means that the higher the number of steps set the more memory & kwrite; will use for this. Setting this entry to 10 would mean that the user would be be able reverse the last ten operations, i. e. click the undo button 10 times and obtain results.
Automatic indentation
Indentations of more than the selected number of spaces will not be shortened.
Tab key indents
This allows the Tab; key to be used to indent.
This allows the backspace key to be used to indent.
This allows the Tab; key insert indent characters.
This allows the Tab; key insert a tab.
This allows the Tab; key indent the current line.
