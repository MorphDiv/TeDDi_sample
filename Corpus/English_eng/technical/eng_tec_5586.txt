The DOM Tree Viewer
Using the DOM Tree Viewer
To begin using The DOM Tree Viewer in & konqueror;, select Tools Show DOM Tree. This will open a new window which displays the DOM of the current web page you are viewing. By default the display starts at the root node of the document, example: documentElement, all other nodes that you will see are children or descendants of the root node.
If you wish to manipulate the DOM tree in any way you will have to use an external script to do so.
