(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Like array(), this is not really a function, but a language construct. list() is used to assign a list of variables in one operation.
Example 1. list() examples
?php $info = array( 'coffee', 'brown', 'caffeine'); / / Listing all the variables list($drink, $color, $power) = $info; print "$drink is $color and $power makes it special.\n"; / / Listing some of them list($drink,, $power) = $info; print "$drink has $power.\n"; / / Or let's skip to only the third one list (,, $power) = $info; print "I need $power!\n";?
Example 2.
An example use of list()
table tr th Employee name / th th Salary / th / tr ?php $result = mysql_query ("SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees",$conn); while (list ($id, $name, $salary) = mysql_fetch_row ($result)) {print ("tr \n"." td a href=\"info.php?id=$id\ "$name / a / td \n"." td $salary / td \n". "/ tr \n");}? / table
Warning
list() assigns the values starting with the right-most parameter.
If you are using plain variables, you don 't have to worry about this.
But if you are using arrays with indices you usually expect the order of the indices in the array the same you wrote in the list() from left to right; which it isn't.
It 's assigned in the reverse order.
Example 3.
Using list() with array indices
?php $info = array( 'coffee', 'brown', 'caffeine'); list($a[0], $a[1], $a[2]) = $info; var_dump($a);?
array( 3) {[2]= string(8) "caffeine "[1]= string(5) "brown" [0]= string(6) "coffee "}
