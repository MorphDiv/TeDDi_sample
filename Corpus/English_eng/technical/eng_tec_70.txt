Java Platform Support
/text/shared/main0650.xhp
Java Platform Support
$[officename] supports the Java platform for running applications and components based on the JavaBeans architecture.
For $[officename] to support the Java platform, you must install the Java 2 Run-time Environment software from Sun Microsystems.
When you installed $[officename], you automatically received the option to install these files if they were not yet installed.
You can also install these files now if required.
The executable set-up file is located in the $[officename]/program folder and on the $[officename] CD.
The Java platform support needs to be activated under $[officename] to run Java applications.
Tools - Options - $[officename] - Java
.
Before you can use a JDBC driver, you need to add its class path.
Choose Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME- Java, and click the Class Path button.
After you add the path information, restart %PRODUCTNAME.
Tools - Options - $[officename] - Java
tab page will be used even if the Java Virtual Machine (JVM, a virtual machine for the Java platform) already has been started.
After modifications to the ClassPath you must restart $[officename].
The same is true for modifications under
Tools - Options - Internet - Proxy
.
Only the two boxes &quot; Http Proxy &quot; and &quot; Ftp Proxy &quot; and their ports don't require a restart, they will be evaluated when you click
OK
.
