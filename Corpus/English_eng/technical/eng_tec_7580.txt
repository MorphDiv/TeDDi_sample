EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR) CERENIA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
This document cannot replace a face- to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Cerenia?
Cerenia contains the active substance maropitant and is available as tablet or as solution for injection.
The tablets are pale-orange and have a score line on both sides so that they can be halved.
Each tablet is marked with the Pfizer logo on one side and with the letters “ MPT” and the quantity of maropitant on the other side.
The solution for injection is clear and colourless to light yellow.
What is Cerenia used for?
Cerenia is an anti-emetic, this means that it stops vomiting.
It is used in dogs to prevent vomiting such as vomiting caused by chemotherapy (medicines used for the treatment of cancer, some of which are known to cause vomiting).
In combination with supportive measures such as other veterinary treatment or a special diet, Cerenia can also be used in the treatment of vomiting (either as injection or as injection followed by tablets).
For these purposes, Cerenia can be given for up to five days.
Cerenia tablets can also be used in a higher dosage for a maximum of two days to prevent vomiting due to motion (travel) sickness when a dog tends to vomit when travelling by car.
How does Cerenia work?
Cerenia blocks a neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, which acts in the central nervous system.
It prevents a peptide (“ Substance P”) from binding to the NK1 receptors, which is involved in causing vomiting.
By stopping “ Substance P”, Cerenia acts as an anti-emetic.
How has Cerenia been studied?
A large number of studies with Cerenia were carried out either in laboratory dogs or in animal patients at veterinary practises in several European countries and in the USA.
For the prevention of vomiting, Cerenia was studied in dogs who received either Cerenia or a placebo (this is a dummy tablet or injection without any active ingredient) before another substance known to trigger vomiting (such as those used in chemotherapy) was given to them.
For the treatment of vomiting, the effect of Cerenia (or a placebo) was examined in sick dogs that were vomiting for various reasons, for example because of a gastrointestinal infection.
Most of these dogs also received 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

Dogs were treated with either 1 mg/ kg (injection) or 2 mg/ kg (tablet) once daily up to 5 days.
In order to study the effect of Cerenia in motion sickness, dogs known to vomit when travelling were taken on car journeys lasting several hours for up to 2 days.
The animals received either Cerenia tablets at a dose of 8 mg/ kg bodyweight or a placebo of up to 2 days.
What benefit has Cerenia shown during the studies?
The results of the studies showed that Cerenia was more effective than the placebo: less vomiting was seen in dogs that received the medicine than in dogs that received a placebo, both in the treatment or in the prevention of vomiting.
The treatment of a vomiting dog should be started with the injection, since vomiting animals might not be able to keep a tablet down (as they might throw the intact tablet up again).
For follow-up treatment, the animal owner can administer the tablets to the dog.
Also, the treatment of vomiting should only be together with other supportive measure or other veterinary therapy while addressing the underlying causes of the vomiting.
What is the risk associated with Cerenia?
Cerenia was generally well tolerated when administered daily at dosages up to 5 times the recommended doses for an extended period of time (up to 3 times the recommended maximum duration of treatment).
A common side effect in the high dose group of 8 mg/ kg (motion sickness) was vomiting before the car journey started.
Since this was mainly observed in dogs with an empty stomach, it is recommended to feed a light meal or snack a while before the tablets are given.
Other reported side effects were decreased activity levels and tiredness.
The active substance in Cerenia, maropitant, is broken down via the liver and it is, therefore, recommended to use it with caution in dogs with liver disease.
And because maropitant might affect the heart activity and Cerenia should be used with caution in animals with certain heart conditions.
Since Cerenia has not been studied in very young dogs or pregnant or lactating bitches, any use of Cerenia in these animals should be discussed with your veterinarian.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
Cerenia does not represent a particular risk for people.
However, maropitant can produce acute eye irritation and in the case of accidental eye exposure, flush the eyes with plenty of water and seek medical attention.
In case of accidental ingestion seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Why has Cerenia been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of Cerenia exceed its risks for the treatment and prevention of vomiting including that induced by chemotherapy or motion sickness, and recommended that Cerenia be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about Cerenia:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Cerenia to Pfizer Ltd. on 29/ 09/ 2006.
Information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label/ outer package.
