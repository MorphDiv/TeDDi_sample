My Bookmarks This module lets you configure the bookmarks home page. The bookmarks home page is accessible at bookmarks: /.
Cache This module lets you configure your cache settings. The cache is an internal memory in Konqueror where recently read web pages are stored. If you want to retrieve a web page again that you have recently read, it will not be downloaded from the Internet, but rather retrieved from the cache, which is a lot faster.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or other KDE applications using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer, initiated by a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie, allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that you trust, you might want to set the policy to accept, then you can access the web sites without being prompted every time KDE receives a cookie.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or any other KDE application using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer from a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. You might, for example want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie or simply reject or accept everything. For example, you might choose to accept all cookies from your favorite shopping web site. For this all you have to do is either browse to that particular site and when you are presented with the cookie dialog box, click on This domain under the'apply to' tab and choose accept or simply specify the name of the site in the Domain Specific Policy tab and set it to accept. This enables you to receive cookies from trusted web sites without being asked every time KDE receives a cookie.
Variable Proxy Configuration
You must specify at least one valid proxy environment variable.
Make sure you entered the actual environment variable name rather than its value. For example, if the environment variable is HTTP_PROXY=http: / /localhost:3128 you need to enter HTTP_PROXY here instead of the actual value http: / /localhost:3128.

Proxy A proxy server is an intermediate program that sits between your machine and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching and/ or filtering. Caching proxy servers give you faster access to sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching the content of those pages; filtering proxy servers, on the other hand, provide the ability to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block. Note: Some proxy servers provide both services.

Reject the so called third-party cookies. These are cookies that originate from a site other than the one you are currently browsing. For example, if you visit www. foobar. com while this option is on, only cookies that originate from www. foobar. com will be processed per your settings. Cookies from any other site will be rejected. This reduces the chances of site operators compiling a profile about your daily browsing habits.
Only accept cookies from originating server
Automatically accept temporary cookies meant to expire at the end of the current session. Such cookies will not be stored in your computer's hard drive or storage device. Instead, they are deleted when you close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. NOTE: Checking this option along with the next one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.
Automatically accept session cookies
Treat all cookies as session cookies. Session cookies are small pieces of data that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory until you quit or close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. Unlike regular cookies, session cookies are never stored on your hard drive or other storage medium. NOTE: Checking this option along with the previous one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.
Treat & all cookies as session cookies
Determines how cookies received from a remote machine will be handled: Ask will cause KDE to ask for your confirmation whenever a server wants to set a cookie. Accept will cause cookies to be accepted without prompting you. Reject will cause the cookiejar to refuse all cookies it receives. NOTE: Domain specific policies, which can be set below, always take precedence over the default policy.

Disable Passive FTP
When FTP connections are passive the client connects to the server, instead of the other way round, so firewalls do not block the connection; old FTP servers may not support Passive FTP though.

While a file is being uploaded its extension is ". part". When fully uploaded it is renamed to its real name.
Setup proxy configuration. A proxy server is an intermediate machine that sits between your computer and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching and filtering. Caching proxy servers give you faster access to web sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching those pages; filtering proxy servers usually provide the ability to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block. If you are uncertain whether or not you need to use a proxy server to connect to the Internet, consult your Internet service provider's setup guide or your system administrator.

Windows Shares Konqueror is able to access shared Microsoft Windows file systems, if properly configured. If there is a specific computer from which you want to browse, fill in the Browse server field. This is mandatory if you are not running Samba locally. The Broadcast address and WINS address fields will also be available, if you use the native code, or the location of the'smb. conf 'file from which the options are read, when using Samba. In any case, the broadcast address (interfaces in smb. conf) must be set up if it is guessed incorrectly or you have multiple cards. A WINS server usually improves performance, and reduces the network load a lot. The bindings are used to assign a default user for a given server, possibly with the corresponding password, or for accessing specific shares. If you choose to, new bindings will be created for logins and shares accessed during browsing. You can edit all of them from here. Passwords will be stored locally, and scrambled so as to render them unreadable to the human eye. For security reasons, you may not want to do that, as entries with passwords are clearly indicated as such.

Browser Identification The browser-identification module allows you to have full control over how Konqueror will identify itself to web sites you browse. This ability to fake identification is necessary because some web sites do not display properly when they detect that they are not talking to current versions of either Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, even if the browser actually supports all the necessary features to render those pages properly. For such sites, you can use this feature to try to browse them. Please understand that this might not always work, since such sites might be using non-standard web protocols and or specifications. NOTE: To obtain specific help on a particular section of the dialog box, simply click on the quick help button on the window title bar, then click on the section for which you are seeking help.
Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker. More information about LISa can be found at the LISa Homepage or contact Alexander Neundorf & lt; neundorf@kde. org gt;.
