Introduction
& klipper; is the & kde; clipboard utility. It stores clipboard history, and allows you to link clipboard contents to application actions. Please report any problems or feature requests to Esben Mose Hansen (see http: / /mosehansen. dk/ about for contact details).
Using & klipper;
Basic Usage
The & klipper; icon.
The & klipper; icon
To display the clipboard history, click on the & klipper; icon in the & kde; panel, or press Ctrl; Alt; V. Previous clipboard entries are shown at the top of the popup menu which appears. Selecting one of these copies it to the clipboard, from where it can be pasted into any & kde; or X application as usual.
You can search through the clipboard history by opening it (click on & klipper;) and typing your query. The results are updated as you type. In case you're wondering how to use the accelerator keys in the & klipper; menu, just press & Alt; and the accelerator you want. For example, to clear the clipboard history when the & klipper; menu is open, press Alt; L.
To remove & klipper;, click on the handle next to it (a small black triangle), and from the menu that appears, select Remove Klipper.
Actions
& klipper; can perform actions on the contents of the clipboard, based on whether they match a particular regular expression. For example, any clipboard contents starting with http: / / can be passed to & Netscape; or & konqueror; as & URL; s to open.
To use this feature, just copy a & URL; or filename to the clipboard. If there is a matching regular expression in & klipper; 's list, a menu will appear showing you the options you have (eg; Open & URL; in & konqueror;, open & URL; in & Netscape;). Use the mouse or keyboard to select the option you want, and & klipper; will run the program you have selected, opening the address pointed to by the clipboard contents.
If you do not want to perform any actions on the clipboard contents, select Do Nothing on the pop-up menu to return to what you were doing before. If you leave the menu, it will disappear, leaving you to continue your work. You can change the time that the menu remains for in the Configure Klipper... dialog, with the option Timeout for action pop-ups under the General tab.
Actions can be disabled completely by clicking on & klipper; and selecting Actions Enabled, or by pressing Ctrl; Alt; X.
Clipboard contents which match a regular expression can also be edited before performing an action on them. Select Edit contents... on the & klipper; pop-up menu, and you can change the clipboard contents in the dialog which appears, before clicking the OK button to run the appropriate action.
Pressing Ctrl; Alt; R shows the pop-up menu to repeat the last action which & klipper; performed.
Clipboard/ Selection Behavior
General
& klipper; can be used to set the behavior of the clipboard and selection in & kde;.
The & X-Window; uses two separate clipboard buffers: the selection and the clipboard. Text is placed in the selection buffer by simply selecting it, and can be pasted with the middle mouse button. To place text in the clipboard buffer, select it and press Ctrl; X or Ctrl; C. Text from the clipboard buffer is pasted using Ctrl; V or by selecting Edit Paste.
Changing Clipboard/ Selection Behavior
In order to change clipboard/ selection behavior, select Configure Klipper... from the & klipper; pop-up menu, and in the dialog box that appears, select the General tab. Selecting Separate clipboard and selection makes the clipboard and selection function as completely separate buffers as described above. With this option set, the option Ignore selection will prevent & klipper; from including the contents of the selection in its clipboard history and from performing actions on the contents of the selection. Selecting Synchronize contents of the clipboard and the selection causes the clipboard and selection buffers to always be the same, meaning that text in the selection can be pasted with either the middle mouse button or the key combination Ctrl; V, and similarly for text in the clipboard buffer.
Configuring & klipper;
Viewing the Configuration Dialog
To view or change & klipper; 's settings, open the & klipper; pop-up menu, and select Configure Klipper.... The & klipper; configuration dialog will appear. Its contents are described below.
General Options
Popup menu at mouse-cursor position
Make the & klipper; popup menus appear at the position of the mouse cursor, instead of their default position (in the & kde; Panel). Useful if you use the mouse more than the keyboard.
Save clipboard contents on exit
If this option is on, the clipboard history will be saved when & klipper; exits, allowing you to use it next time & klipper; starts.
Remove white space when executing actions
If selected, any white space (spaces, tabs, & etc;) at the beginning and end of the clipboard contents will be removed before passing the clipboard contents to an application. This is useful, for example, if the clipboard contains a & URL; with spaces which, if opened by a web browser, would cause an error.
Replay actions on an item selected from history
If this is switched on, selecting an item from the history causes & klipper; to display the actions pop-up on that item, if appropriate.
Prevent empty clipboard
If selected, the clipboard will never be empty: & klipper; will insert the most recent item from the clipboard history into the clipboard instead of allowing it to be empty.
Ignore selection
Sets the clipboard mode. See.
Synchronize contents of the clipboard and the selection
Separate clipboard and selection
Timeout for Action pop-ups
Set the time that a popup menu will remain for if you do nothing with it.
Clipboard history size
Sets the number of items that are stored in the clipboard history.
Actions Options
Editing Expressions/ Actions
On the Actions tab, double-click the regular expression or action that you want to edit. An in-place text editing box will appear in which the text can be edited as you wish. Make sure you press Enter when you are done.
Adding Expressions/ Actions
Click the Add Action button to add a regular expression for & klipper; to match. & klipper; uses & Qt; 's QRegExp, which understands most regular expressions as you would use in grep or egrep for instance.
You can add a description of the regular expression type (eg; HTTP URL) by left clicking in the Description column.
You can find detailed information about the use of QRegExp regular expressions at http: / /doc. trolltech. com/ qregexp. html#details. Note that & klipper; does not support the wildcard mode mentioned on this page.
Edit the regular expression as described above. To add a command to execute, right click, select Add Command and edit the command which appears in the tree under the regular expression.
Note that %s in the command line is replaced with the clipboard contents, & eg; if your command definition is kedit %s and your clipboard contents are / home/ phil/ textfile, the command kedit / home/ phil/ textfile will be run. To include %s in the command line, escape it with a backslash, as so: \\%s.
Advanced...
Brings up the Disable Actions for windows of type WM_CLASS dialog.
Some programs, such as & konqueror;, use the clipboard internally. If you get unwanted & klipper; pop-ups all the time when using a certain application, do the following:
Open the application.
From a terminal, run xprop | grep WM_CLASS and then click on the window of the application you are running.
The first string after the equals sign is the one to enter.
Once the WM_CLASS is added, no more actions will be generated for windows of that application.
Shortcuts Options
The shortcuts tab allows you to change the keyboard shortcuts which are used to access & klipper; functions. You can change the shortcut to one of three things:
None
The selected action cannot be accessed directly from the keyboard
Default
The selected action uses & klipper; 's default key. These are the shortcuts referred to in this manual.
Custom
The selected action is assigned to the keys you choose.
To choose a custom key for the action you have selected, click on the representation of a key in the lower right of the screen to activate it, and type the desired key combination on your keyboard, as in any & kde; application.
