(PHP 3 CVS only)
Returns:
TRUE on success, FALSE on errors
sesam_commit() commits any pending updates to the database.
Note that there is no "auto-commit" feature as in other databases, as it could lead to accidental data loss.
Uncommitted data at the end of the current script (or when calling sesam_disconnect()) will be discarded by an implied sesam_rollback() call.
See also: sesam_rollback().
Example 1.
Committing an update to the SESAM database
?php if (sesam_connect ("mycatalog", "myschema", "otto")) {if (!sesam_execimm ("INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (*, 'Small Test', 0, 8, 15 )")) die("insert failed"); if (!sesam_commit()) die("commit failed");}?
