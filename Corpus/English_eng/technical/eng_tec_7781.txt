EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
SIKLOS
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Siklos?
Siklos is a medicine containing the active substance hydroxycarbamide.
It is available as tablets (1,000 mg).
What is Siklos used for?
Siklos is used in adults and in children who have sickle cell syndrome (a genetic disease where the red blood cells change shape and become inflexible when they are not carrying oxygen).
It is used to prevent painful vaso-occlusive crises that are recurrent (keep coming back).
Vaso-occlusive crises happen when blood vessels become blocked by the abnormal red blood cells, restricting the flow of blood to an organ.
They can include acute chest syndrome, a life-threatening condition when the patient has sudden chest pain, fever, hard breathing or signs of fluid in the lungs on an X-ray.
Because the number of patients with sickle cell syndrome is low, the disease is considered ‘ rare’, and Siklos was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 9 July 2003.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Siklos used?
Treatment with Siklos should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the management of sickle cell syndrome.
Siklos is taken once a day, preferably in the morning before breakfast.
The starting dose is usually 15 mg per kilogram body weight, to the nearest 250 mg (quarter tablet).
The tablet has special score lines so that it can be easily divided into four equal parts.
The dose is adjusted according to response to treatment, with the usual dose being between 15 and 30 mg per kilogram body weight per day.
Doses of up to 35 mg per kilogram body weight per day can be used in exceptional cases, as long as the patient ’ s blood is monitored for side effects.
Patients who do not respond to this dose or who have side effects may need to stop or suspend treatment.
The dose of Siklos should be reduced in patients who have mild or moderate problems with their kidneys, and it should not be used in patients with severe problems with their kidneys or liver.
Siklos is not recommended for children aged below 2 years.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
How does Siklos work?
The active substance in Siklos, hydroxycarbamide, inhibits the growth and reproduction of some cells, such as blood cells.
Although the precise way that it works in this disease is not understood, hydroxycarbamide can reduce the numbers of cells that are circulating in the blood, as well as prevent 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

This reduces the risk of blood vessels becoming blocked.
Hydroxycarbamide, which used to be known as hydroxyurea, has been available in the European Union (EU) for several decades for use in other illnesses, including some types of cancer.
How has Siklos been studied?
Because hydroxycarbamide is a well-known substance that is already used in other medicines, the company used data from the scientific literature to support the use of Siklos in adults and children with sickle cell syndrome.
In particular, it presented evidence on the effectiveness of Siklos from 11 published studies involving 378 children and from three national registries of information on 155 children who were treated with Siklos for up to 7 years.
It also presented evidence from one study in 299 adults, in which the effects of Siklos were compared with those of placebo (a dummy treatment), as well as the results of other studies involving 430 adults and one national registry of information on 123 adults treated with Siklos.
The studies compared the number of vaso-occlusive crises before and after treatment with Siklos, as defined by any painful episode involving the arms, legs, abdomen (tummy), back or chest.
What benefit has Siklos shown during the studies?
Patients treated with Siklos had fewer vaso-occlusive crises after treatment with Siklos than before treatment, with the frequency falling by between 66% and 80% in children and adults.
The frequency of cases of acute chest syndrome also fell by 25 to 33%.
There were also fewer admissions into hospital, and fewer days spent in hospital.
The effects were sustained for up to 7 years.
In the study comparing Siklos to placebo in adults, there were fewer vaso-occlusive crises in the patients taking Siklos (2.5 crises per year) than in those taking placebo (4.5 crises per year).
What is the risk associated with Siklos?
The most common side effect with Siklos (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) is bone marrow suppression, causing neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), reticulocytopenia (low levels of reticulocytes, a type of immature red blood cell) and macrocytosis (enlargement of red blood cells).
Patients taking Siklos should have blood tests before and regularly during treatment, to check blood cell counts and also to monitor their kidneys and liver.
Blood cell counts normally return to normal within two weeks of stopping Siklos treatment.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Siklos, see the Package Leaflet.
Siklos should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to hydroxycarbamide or any of the other ingredients.
It should also not be used by people who have severe problems with their kidneys or liver, or who have dangerously low blood cell counts.
Breast-feeding should be stopped while taking Siklos.
Why has Siklos been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Siklos’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the prevention of recurrent painful vaso-occlusive crises including acute chest syndrome in paediatric and adult patients suffering from symptomatic sickle cell syndrome.
The Committee recommended that Siklos be given marketing authorisation.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Siklos?
The company that makes Siklos will provide information packs for doctors and for patients describing the safety information on the medicine.
Other information about Siklos:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Siklos to Addmedica on 29 June 2007.
