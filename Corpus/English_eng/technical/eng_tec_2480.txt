(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Makes a copy of a file.
Returns TRUE if the copy succeeded, FALSE otherwise.
Example 1. copy() example
if (!copy($file, $file .'.bak')) {print ("failed to copy $file... br \n");}
Note:
As of PHP 4.3.0, both source and dest may be URLs if the "fopen wrappers" have been enabled.
See fopen() for more details.
If dest is an URL, the copy operation may fail if the wrapper does not support overwriting of existing files.
Warning
If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten.
See also move_uploaded_file(), rename(), and the section of the manual about handling file uploads.
