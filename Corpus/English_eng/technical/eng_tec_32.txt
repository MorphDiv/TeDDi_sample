mw changed &quot; axes;scaling &quot; to &quot; Y axes, scaling &quot;
Scale
Controls the scaling of the y-axis.
The x-axis can also be scaled here for X-Y charts.
Axes are automatically scaled by $[officename] so that all values are optimally displayed.
To achieve specific results, you can manually change the axis scaling.
For example, you can display only the top areas of the columns by shifting the zero line upwards.
Scale
Minimum, Maximum, Major interval, Minor interval count
and
Reference value
.
Minimum
Defines the minimum value for the beginning of the axis.
Maximum
Defines the maximum value for the end of the axis.
Major interval
Defines the interval for the main division of the axes.
The main interval cannot be larger than the value area.
Minor interval count
Defines the interval for the subdivision of the axes.
Reference value
Specifies at which position to display the values along the axis.
Automatic
Automatic
option in order to modify the values.
Disable this feature if you are working with &quot; fixed &quot; values, as it does not permit automatic scaling.
Logarithmic scale
Specifies that you want the axis to be subdivided logarithmically.
Use this feature if you are working with values that differ sharply from each other.
You can use logarithmic scaling to make the grid lines of the axis equidistant but have values that may increase or decrease.
Reverse direction
Defines where the lower and where the higher values are displayed at the axis.
The unchecked state is the mathematical direction.
That means for Cartesian coordinate systems that the x-axis shows the lower values on the left and the y-axis shows the lower values at the bottom.
For polar coordinate systems the mathematical angle axis direction is counterclockwise and the radial axis is from inner to outer.
