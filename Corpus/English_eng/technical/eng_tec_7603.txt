CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Horses
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
Active immunisation of horses from 6 months of age against equine influenza to reduce clinical signs and virus excretion after infection, and active immunisation against tetanus to prevent mortality.
Influenza Onset of immunity:
Duration of immunity:
Tetanus
2 weeks after the primary vaccination course 5 months after the primary vaccination course 12 months after the first revaccination
Onset of immunity:
Duration of immunity:
2 weeks after the primary vaccination course 17 months after the primary vaccination course 24 months after the first revaccination
1 Antigenic units 2 Flocculation equivalents; corresponds with ≥ 30 IU/ ml guinea pig serum in the Ph. Eur. potency test
2/ 17 4.3 Contraindications
None
4.4 Special warnings
Foals should not be vaccinated before the age of 6 months, especially when born to mares that were revaccinated in the last two months of gestation, because of possible interference by maternally derived antibodies.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Only healthy animals should be vaccinated.
Special precautions for use in animals
Not applicable
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
A diffuse hard or soft swelling (max. diameter 5 cm) may occur at the injection site, regressing within 2 days.
Pain at the injection site can occur in rare cases which may result in temporary functional discomfort (stiffness).
In very rare cases, fever, sometimes accompanied by lethargy and inappetence, may occur for 1 day, and up to 3 days in exceptional circumstances.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Can be used during pregnancy and lactation.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy from the concurrent use of this vaccine with any other vaccine.
Safety and efficacy of concurrent use with Tetanus-Serum from Intervet (see section 4.9) has been demonstrated.
It is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered concurrently or simultaneously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Intramuscular use
Vaccination schedule:
Primary vaccination course
Administer one dose (1ml), by intramuscular injection, according to the following schedule: • Primary vaccination course: first injection from 6 months of age, second injection 4 weeks later
3/ 17 Revaccination Influenza
The first revaccination (third dose) against equine influenza is given 5 months after the primary vaccination course.
This revaccination results in immunity to equine influenza lasting at least 12 months.
The second revaccination is given 12 months after the first revaccination.
The alternate use, at 12 months interval, of a suitable vaccine against equine influenza, containing the strains A/ equi 1/ Prague 56, A/ equi 2/ Newmarket-1/ 93 and A/ equi 2/ Newmarket-2/ 93, is recommended to maintain immunity levels for the influenza component (see scheme).
Tetanus The first revaccination is given not later than 17 months after the primary vaccination course.
Thereafter a maximum interval of two years is recommended (see scheme).

In case of increased infection risk or insufficient colostrum intake, an additional initial injection can be given at the age of 4 months followed by the full vaccination programme (Primary vaccination course at 6 months of age and 4 weeks later)
Concurrent active and passive immunisation (emergency vaccination) The vaccine can be used together with Tetanus-Serum from Intervet for treatment of injured horses that have not been immunised against tetanus.
In that case, the first dose (V1) of vaccine can be given concurrently with the appropriate prophylactic dose of Tetanus-Serum from Intervet at a separate injection site, using separate syringes and needles.
This will lead to a passive protection against tetanus for at least 21 days after concurrent administration.
The second dose of the vaccine (V2) should be administered 4 weeks later.
A third vaccination with Equilis Prequenza Te should be repeated at least four weeks later.
Concurrent use of Equilis Prequenza Te and Tetanus-Serum from Intervet may reduce active immunity against tetanus compared to horses vaccinated with Equilis Prequenza Te in the absence of tetanus antitoxin serum.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Following the administration of a double dose of vaccine, no side-effects other than those described under 4.6 have been observed except for some depression at the day of vaccination
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Zero days
