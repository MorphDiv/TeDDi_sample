PHP has already a long history behind him:
Legendary PHP 1.0, PHP / FI, PHP 3.0 and PHP 4.0.

Migrating from PHP 2 to PHP 3?
PHP / FI 2.0 is no longer supported.
Please see appropriate manual section for information about migration from PHP / FI 2.0.
If you are still working with PHP 2, we strongly recommend you to upgrade straight to PHP 4.
