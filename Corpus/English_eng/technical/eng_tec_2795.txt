Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
This function is only available since PHP 4.3
Since DomXsltStylesheet - process() always returns a well-formed XML DomDocument, no matter what output method was declared in xsl:output and similar attributes / elements, it's of not much use, if you want to output HTML 4 or text data.
This function on the contrary honors xsl:output method=" html|text "and other output control directives.
See the example for instruction of how to use it.
Example 1.
Outputting the result of a XSLT transformation
?php $filename = "stylesheet.xsl"; $xmldoc = domxml_open_file("data.xml"); $xsldoc = domxml_xslt_stylesheet_file($filename); $result = $xsldoc - process($xmldoc); print $xsldoc - result_dump_mem($result);?
See also domxml_xslt_result_dump_file(), domxml_xslt_process()
