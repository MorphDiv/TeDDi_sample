Marble Cache Settings
& Drag location:
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} While dragging the mouse there are two standard behaviours when dealing with a virtual globe: The location below mouse pointer will follow the cursor exactly: As a result e. g. the north pole will not stay at the top which can lead to confusion. By default Marble makes sure that north is always up which results in a dragging behaviour where the location below the mouse pointer slightly "detaches" from the cursor.
Keep Planet Axis Vertically
Follow Mouse Pointer
& On startup:
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} By default Marble will display the home location immediately after the application has started. As an alternative it can also show the last position that was active when the user left the application.
Show Home Location
Return to Last Location Visited
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} When searching for a location Marble can either move instantly to the new location or it can show a travel animation from the previous place to the new place.

& Units
& Distance:
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} The unit that gets used to measure altitude, lengths and distances (e. g. km, mi, ft).
Kilometer, Meter
Miles, Feet
Angle:
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Specifies the notation of angles in coordinates: By default the Degree-Minute-Second notation (e. g. 54°30'00 ") gets used. As an alternative you can choose decimal degrees (e. g. 54.5°).
Degree (DMS)
Degree (Decimal)
Map & Quality
& Still image:
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Specifies the map quality that gets displayed while there is no user input. Usually this allows for high map quality as speed is no concern.
Outline Quality
Low Quality
Normal
High Quality
Print Quality
During & animations:
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Specifies the map quality that gets displayed during map animations (e. g. while dragging the globe). Especially on slow machines it is advisable to set this option to "low quality" as this will give better speed.
Graphics system:
Specifies the graphics system that Qt uses to draw the map. Changing this setting might be a good idea if there are performance issues with the system's graphics drivers.
Raster (Software rendering)
OpenGL
& Text Labels
& Place names:
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Places often have different names in different languages. The label on the map can show the name in the user's language. Alternatively it can display the name in the official language and glyphs of that place.
