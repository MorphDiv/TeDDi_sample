(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Reads to EOF on the given gz-file pointer and writes the (uncompressed) results to standard output.
If an error occurs, returns FALSE.
The file pointer must be valid, and must point to a file successfully opened by gzopen().
The gz-file is closed when gzpassthru() is done reading it (leaving zp useless).
