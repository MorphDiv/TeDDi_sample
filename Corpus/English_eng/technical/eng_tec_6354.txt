KWeather is part of the kdetoys package.
KDE
KWeather
Introduction
& kweather; is an application that provides both a panel icon, allowing you to watch the weather as reported by a local weather station, and providing a weather service that can track multiple weather stations and provide this information to other applications including & konqueror; 's navigation panel and & kontact; 's summary page.
Using & kweather; as a Panel Applet
& RMB; click on an empty space in the panel and select Add Applet to Panel... and then Weather Report in the dialog.
A configuration dialog will open up. Initially the only configuration required to make KWeather work is to select a weather station.
While the weather stations available are fairly comprehensive, not every town in every country will be represented, simply because not every town has an appropriate weather station. If your own town is not represented, you should choose the one nearest you. Since flying planes safely requires accurate weather data, most towns with an airport will be in the list, so a good bet is to look for the nearest airport to you.
At this point, you can press the OK button and the dialog will close. You will now have an icon displaying the current weather graphically on your panel. Clicking it once will open a window that shows the weather in detail.
Further configuration is described in the next chapter.
Configuring & kweather;
Display Setup
Weather Station Options
Location:
Select a location from a list of wheater stations.
Panel Display Options
Show icon only
Show icon and temperature
Show icon, temperature, wind and pressure information
You can choose here if the temperature should be displayed beside the icon, or if the current wind speed, direction, and air pressure are also displayed.
The icon is always shown.
Logging Options
Enable logging
By default KWeather does not retain old weather information, and each time it updates the weather the old information is discarded. If you wish instead to keep a record of the weather, enable this option. Then, each time the weather is checked, KWeather will append a new line to the log file containing the current weather conditions in comma separated value form. The information written will be the date, wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, cover, visibility, and "current weather".
Log file
If you have enabled the Enable logging check box, this option will become available. Enter or browse to the location you would like KWeather to keep it's log file.
Weather Service
Available stations
Add or remove stations
Update All
Update all the listed stations immediately.
Stop Weather Service
Stop fetching weather updates for all listed stations, and stop providing weather information to the & konqueror; navigation panel and & kontact;
KWeather Interfaces
While the most obvious KWeather interface is the panel icon, there are several other places where you can access KWeather's information. These are particularly useful if you need to watch multiple weather stations. While & kweather; allows you to track multiple weather stations, the panel icon displays only one at a time.
These additional services are plug-ins to their respective applications, and not provided with KWeather itself.
