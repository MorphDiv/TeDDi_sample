Applying Conditional Formatting
Format - Conditional formatting
, the dialogue box allows you to define up to three conditions per cell, which must be met in order for the selected cells to have a particular format.
Tools - Cell Contents - AutoCalculate
(a check mark is present next to the command when AutoCalculate is enabled).
With conditional formatting, you can, for example, highlight the totals that exceed the average value of all totals.
If the totals change, the formatting changes correspondingly, without having to apply other styles manually.
To Define the Conditions
Select the cells to which you want to apply a conditional style.
Format - Conditional Formatting

, and an example is provided below:
Example of Conditional Formatting:
Highlighting Totals Above/Under the Average Value
Step 1:
Generate Number Values
You want to give certain values in your tables particular emphasis.
For example, in a table of turnovers, you can show all the values above the average in green and all those below the average in red.
This is possible with conditional formatting.
First of all, write a table in which a few different values occur.
For your test you can create tables with any random numbers:
In one of the cells enter the formula =RAND(), and you will obtain a random number between 0 and 1.
If you want integers of between 0 and 50, enter the formula =INT(RAND()*50).
Copy the formula to create a row of random numbers.
Click the bottom right corner of the selected cell, and drag to the right until the desired cell range is selected.
In the same way as described above, drag down the corner of the rightmost cell in order to create more rows of random numbers.
Step 2:
Define Cell Styles
The next step is to apply a cell style to all values that represent above-average turnover, and one to those that are below the average.
Ensure that the Styles and Formatting window is visible before proceeding.
Format Cells
in the context menu.
Format Cells
dialogue box on the
Background
tab, select a background colour.
Click
OK
.
New Style from Selection
icon.
Enter the name of the new style.
For this example, name the style &quot; Above &quot; .
To define a second style, click again in a blank cell and proceed as described above.
Assign a different background colour for the cell and assign a name (for this example, &quot; Below &quot; ).
Step 3:
Calculate Average
In our particular example, we are calculating the average of the random values.
The result is placed in a cell:
Insert - Function
.
Shrink / Maximise
icon.
OK
.
Step 4:
Apply Cell Style
Now you can apply the conditional formatting to the sheet:
Select all cells with the random numbers.
Format - Conditional Formatting
command to open the corresponding dialogue box.
Define the condition as follows:
If cell value is less than J14, format with cell style &quot; Below &quot; , and if cell value is greater than or equal to J14, format with cell style &quot; Above &quot; .
Step 5:
Copy Cell Style
To apply the conditional formatting to other cells later:
Click one of the cells that has been assigned conditional formatting.
Copy the cell to the clipboard.
Select the cells that are to receive this same formatting.
Edit - Paste Special
.
The
Paste Special
dialogue box appears.
Selection
area, mark only the
Formats
check box.
All other check boxes must be unmarked.
Click
OK
.
