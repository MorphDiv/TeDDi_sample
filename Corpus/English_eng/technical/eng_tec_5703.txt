First Steps With & kmplot;
Simple Function Plot
In the sidebar on the left, there is the Create button with a drop down menu for creating new plots. Click on it, and select Cartesian Plot. The text box for editing the current equation will be focused. Replace the default text with y = x^2 and press & Enter;. This will draw the plot of y = x 2 in the coordinate system. Clicking on the Create button again, select Cartesian Plot, and this time enter the text y = 5sin(x) to get another plot.
Click on one of the lines you have just plotted. Now the crosshair becomes the color of the current plot and is attached to the it. You can use the mouse to move the crosshair along the plot. In the status bar at the bottom of the window the coordinates of the current position is displayed. Note that if the plot touches the x-axis the root will be displayed in the status bar, too.
Click the mouse again and the crosshair will be detached from the plot.
Edit Properties
Let us make some changes to the function and change the color of the plot.
The Functions sidebar lists all the functions that you have plotted. If y = x^2 is n't already selected, select it. Here you have access to a lot of options. Let us rename the function and move the plot 5 units down. Change the function equation to parabola(x) = x^2 - 5 and hit enter. To select another color for the plot, click the Color button in the section Appearance at the bottom of the function sidebar and select a new color.
All changes can be undone via Edit Undo.
In the main toolbar there is a simple text box in which you can enter a function expression. Simply enter: x^2 and press & Enter;. This will draw the plot of y=x^2 in the coordinate system. Enter another expression in the text box like 5*sin(x) and another plot will be added.
You can edit all functions with the Plot Edit Plots... menu entry. A dialog appears which lists all the functions that you have plotted. Notice that & kmplot; has automatically found a unique function name for your expressions and completed the expression to a function equation.
Select f(x)=x^2 in the list. A double click or pressing the Edit button will show you a dialog window. Here you have access to a lot of options. Let us rename the function and move the plot 5 units down. Change the function equation to
parabola(x)=x^2-5
To select another color for the plot click into the Color: box. Finally press OK and your changes take effect in the coordinate system.
All changes can be undone until you press OK in the Edit Plots dialog.
