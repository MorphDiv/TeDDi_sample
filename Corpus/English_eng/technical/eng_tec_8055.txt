EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
BONVIVA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Bonviva?
Bonviva is a medicine that contains the active substance ibandronic acid.
It is available as white, oblong tablets (150 mg) or as a solution for injection (3 mg).
What is Bonviva used for?
Bonviva is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile) in women who have been through the menopause and are at risk of developing bone fractures (breaks).
Its effect in reducing the risk of vertebral (spine) fractures has been shown in studies, but its effect on the risk of fractures of the neck of the femur (the top of the thighbone) has not been established.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Bonviva used?
Bonviva can be given either by mouth as a tablet or as an injection into a vein.
If the tablet is used, the dose is one tablet every month.
The tablet must always be taken after an overnight fast, one hour before any food of drink except for water, and with a full glass of plain water.
The patient must not lie down for one hour after taking the tablet.
The dose by injection is 3 mg once every three months.
Patients taking Bonviva should also take vitamin D and calcium supplements if they do not get enough from their diet.
Bonviva is not recommended for patients who have severe kidney problems.
How does Bonviva work?
Osteoporosis happens when not enough new bone grows to replace the bone that is naturally broken down.
Gradually, the bones become thin and fragile, and more likely to break.
Osteoporosis is more common in women after the menopause, when the levels of the female hormone oestrogen fall.
The active substance in Bonviva, ibandronic acid, is a bisphosphonate.
It stops the action of the osteoclasts, the cells in the body that are involved in breaking down the bone tissue.
This leads to less bone loss.
How has Bonviva been studied?
Bonviva was studied in three main studies involving women with osteoporosis.
The first study compared Bonviva 2.5 mg tablets taken once a day with placebo (a dummy treatment) in almost 3,000 women and looked at how many new spine fractures were seen in the patients over three years.

The other two studies compared the 150 mg monthly tablets (1,609 patients) and the injections (1,395 patients) with the 2.5 mg once-daily tablets.
The studies looked at the change in the density of the bones in the spine and the hip over two years.
Note that the 2.5 mg once-daily tablets are no longer authorised.
What benefit has Bonviva shown during the studies?
In the first study, daily treatment with Bonviva 2.5 mg tablets reduced the risk of new spine fractures by 62% in comparison with placebo.
The other two studies showed that the 150 mg monthly tablets and the injections were more effective than the 2.5 mg once-daily tablets at increasing bone density in the spine and the hip.
Over two years, bone density in the spine increased by 7% with the monthly tablets and by 6% with the injections, compared with 5% with the daily tablets.
In the hip, bone density increased by 4% with the monthly tablets and by 3% with the injections, compared with 2% with the daily tablets.
What is the risk associated with Bonviva?
The most common side effects with Bonviva tablets (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), diarrhoea, abdominal pain (stomach ache), dyspepsia (indigestion), nausea (feeling sick), influenza-like illness, fatigue (tiredness), musculoskeletal pain (pain in the muscles and bones), arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain) and musculoskeletal stiffness.
With the injection, constipation, headache and back pain are also seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Bonviva, see the Package Leaflet.
Bonviva should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ibandronic acid or any of the other ingredients.
It must not be used in patients who have hypocalcaemia (low blood calcium levels).
Bonviva treatment may be linked to osteonecrosis of the jaw (collapse of bone tissue in the jaw).
Care is needed in patients who receive the medicine and are having dental treatment.
Why has Bonviva been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Bonviva’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture.
The Committee recommended that Bonviva be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Bonviva:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Bonviva to Roche Registration Limited on 23 February 2004.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 23 February 2009.
