system information
This page displays information about the system Central Processing Unit (CPU).
The exact information displayed is system-dependent. On some systems, processor information cannot be displayed yet.
On & Linux;, this information is read from / proc/ cpuinfo, which is only available if the / proc pseudo-filesystem is compiled into the kernel.
The exact contents of the window will depend on the CPU (s) in your machine, but the window is organized into two columns. The first column is the parameter, and the second column is the value of that parameter.
The user cannot modify any settings on this page.
