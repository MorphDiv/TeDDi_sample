About Bug Reporting - Help
Information about bug reporting
You can help us improve this software by filing a bug report.
It is safe to close this dialog. If you do not want to, you do not have to file a bug report.
In order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system. (You may also need to install some debug packages.)
Bug Reporting Assistant Guide
This assistant will guide you through the crash reporting process for the KDE Bug Reports Database Site. All the information you enter on the bug report must be in English, if possible, as KDE is formed internationally.
What do you know about the crash?
In this page you need to describe how much do you know about the desktop and the application state before it crashed.
If you can, describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances, and what you were doing when the application crashed (this information is going to be requested later.) You can mention:
actions you were taking inside or outside the application
documents or images that you were using and their type/ format (later if you go to look at the report in the bug tracking system, you can attach a file to the report)
widgets that you were running
the URL of a web site you were browsing
configuration details of the application
or other strange things you notice before or after the crash.
Screenshots can be very helpful sometimes. You can attach them to the bug report after it is posted to the bug tracking system.
Crash Information (backtrace)
This page will generate a "backtrace" of the crash. This is information that tells the developers where the application crashed.
If the crash information is not detailed enough, you may need to install some debug packages and reload it (if the Install Debug Symbols button is available you can use it to automatically install the missing information.)
You can find more information about backtraces, what they mean, and how they are useful at %1
Once you get a useful backtrace (or if you do not want to install the missing debugging packages) you can continue.
Conclusions
Using the quality of the crash information gathered, and your answers on the previous page, the assistant will tell you if the crash is worth reporting or not.
If the crash is worth reporting but the application is not supported in the KDE bug tracking system, you will need to directly contact the maintainer of the application.
If the crash is listed as being not worth reporting, and you think the assistant has made a mistake, you can still manually report the bug by logging into the bug tracking system. You can also go back and change information and download debug packages.
Login into the bug tracking system
We may need to contact you in the future to ask for further information. As we need to keep track of the bug reports, you need to have an account on the KDE bug tracking system. If you do not have one, you can create one here: %1
Then, enter your username and password and press the Login button. You can use this login to directly access the KDE bug tracking system later.
The KWallet dialog may appear when pressing Login to save your password in the KWallet password system. Also, it will prompt you for the KWallet password upon loading to autocomplete the login fields if you use this assistant again.
List of possible duplicate reports
This page will search the bug report database for similar crashes which are possible duplicates of your bug. If there are similar bug reports found, you can double click on them to see details. Then, read the current bug report information so you can check to see if they are similar.
If you are very sure your bug is the same as another that is previously reported, you can set your information to be attached to the existing report.
If you are unsure whether your report is the same, follow the main options to tentatively mark your crash as a duplicate of that report. This is usually the safest thing to do. We cannot uncombine bug reports, but we can easily merge them.
If not enough possible duplicates are found, or you did not find a similar report, then you can force it to search for more bug reports (only if the date range limit is not reached.)
If you do not find any related reports, your crash information is not useful enough, and you really cannot give additional information about the crash context, then it is better to not file the bug report, thereby closing the assistant.
Details of the bug report and your system
In this case you need to write a title and description of the crash. Explain as best you can.
You can also specify your distribution method (GNU/ Linux distribution or packaging system) or if you compiled the KDE Platform from sources.
You should write in English.
Sending the Crash Report
The last page will send the bug report to the bug tracking system and will notify you when it is done. It will then show the web address of the bug report in the KDE bug tracking system, so that you can look at the report later.
If the process fails, you can click Retry to try sending the bug report again. If the report cannot be sent because the bug tracking database has a problem, you can save it to a file to manually report later.
Thank you for being part of KDE!

The following options are enabled:
As the usage of these options is not recommended - because they can, in rare cases, be responsible for KDE problems - a backtrace will not be generated. You need to turn these options off and reproduce the problem again in order to get a backtrace.
