People with this condition may also feel depressed, guilty, anxious or tense.
ABILIFY is used to treat adults who suffer from a condition with symptoms such as feeling "high", having excessive amounts of energy, needing much less sleep than usual, talking very quickly with racing ideas and sometimes severe irritability.
It also prevents this condition from returning in patients who have responded to the treatment with ABILIFY.
