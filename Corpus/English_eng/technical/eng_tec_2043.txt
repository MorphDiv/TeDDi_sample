Applying Goal Seek
With the help of Goal Seek you can calculate a value that, as part of a formula, leads to the result you specify for the formula.
You thus define the formula with several fixed values and one variable value and the result of the formula.
Goal Seek Example
To calculate annual interest (I), create a table with the values for the capital (C), number of years (n), and interest rate (i).
The formula is:
I = C * n* i
i
of 7.5% and the number of years
n
(1) will remain constant.
However, you want to know how much the investment capital
C
would have to be modified in order to attain a particular return
I
.
For this example, calculate how much capital
C
would be required if you want an annual return of £15,000.
C
(an arbitrary value like
£100,000
), number of years
n
(
1
), and interest rate
i
(
7.5%
) in one cell each.
Enter the formula to calculate the interest
I
in another cell.
Instead of
C
,
n
, and
i
use the
reference to the cell
with the corresponding value.
I
, and choose
Tools - Goal Seek
.
The
Goal Seek
dialogue box appears.

In the sheet, click in the cell that contains the value to be changed, in this example it is the cell with the capital value
C
.
Target Value
text box.
In this example, the value is 15,000.
Click
OK
.
Yes
to enter the result in the cell with the variable value.
