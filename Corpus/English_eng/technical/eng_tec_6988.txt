What's New in GIMP 2.8?

User Interface
New single window mode
With this new feature it will be possible to work with all the
The new look of the single window mode
New file save workflow
Now Save and Save as work only with xcf formats. If you want to export an image in another format, say jpg or png, you have to explicitly Export it. This enhances the workflow and lets you simply overwrite the original file or export to various other formats.
The new image workflow
New image bar
A new useful image bar comes with the single window mode, which lets you switch easily between open images through the means of a tab bar with image thumbnails.
The new image bar
New arrangement options

Multi column docks
New resources tags

Resource tags
Simple math in size entries
Enhancements have also been made to the size entry widget, which is used for inputting most of the x, y, width, height parameters. For example, in the scale dialog it is now possible to write
Math size entries
Minor changes
The new
The new Lock Pixels option
Now you can move between images in single and multi window mode using the shortcuts
Add support for F2 to rename items in lists.
You can now
Since the keyboard shortcuts
Added
The layer modes have been rearranged into more logical and useful groups based on the effect they have on layers. Layer modes that make the layer lighter are in one group, layer modes that make the layer darker in another group, and so forth.
In multi-window mode, you can now close the Toolbox without quitting GIMP.
Allow binding arbitrary actions to extra mouse buttons.
Now it is possible to change the application language directly from the preference menu.
Tools, Filters and Plug-ins
A new tool: Cage Transform
With this new tool is now possible to create custom bending of a selection just moving control points. This is the result of one of our Google Summer of Code 2010 students.
Cage Transform
Improved Text Tool
The text tool has been enhanced to support on canvas text writing and make possible changing the attributes of a single char.
Improved text tool
New layer groups
It is now possible to group set of layers and treat them like an entity. It is possible to switch a group on or off and to move the group in the layers dialog. It is easy to add / remove existing layers to a group or to create / delete a layer inside the group and it is even possible to create embedded groups of groups. It is possible to apply a layer mode to a group as you do with a single layer. All this greatly improves the workflow with complex multilayer images making them easier to manage.
Rotating brushes
Brushes can now be rotated at will, acting on the brush option
The default Quick Mask color is now configurable.
The RTL mode (right to left writing) has been improved in the Text tool.
You can specify the written language in the Text Tool. This helps choosing an appropriate font, or appropriate glyphs for the selected language.
Added optional diagonal guides to the crop tool.
Added
A Cairo based PDF exporter has been implemented. Although being somewhat simplistic, the exporter saves text, embedding fonts into the final PDF file, and attempts to convert bitmaps to vector objects.
Brush dynamics improved.
Added plug-in for loading JPEG2000 images.
Added plug-ins for X11 Mouse Cursor import and export support.
Added fundamental OpenRaster (.ora) import and export support.
Added RGB565 support to the csource plug-in.
Added a new

Miscellaneous
License change
The GIMP license has been changed to (L)GPLv3+.
New script API
A lot of GIMP APIs have been rebuilt to simplify developing new scripts.
To further enhances scripting abilities, API changes to support layer groups have been made.
Backwards Compatibility
To allow migrating from the old tools presets system to the new one, there is a Python
Known Problems
Working with graphics tablets could be problematic due to the GTK+2 library in use. If in this case either use the older version 2.6 or wait for the up coming version 3.0 for the full GTK+3 support.
