The source of the user and group database
This option allows you to select where the user/ group data stored. Currently three storage backends are supported. Files stores user/ group data in traditional / etc/ passwd and / etc/ group flat files. LDAP stores data in a directory server using the posixAccount and posixGroup object classes; this backend allows the management of Samba users/ groups via the sambaSamAccount object class. System provides a read-only access to all users and groups which your installation knows about.
Shell
This option allows you to select the shell which will be the default for new users.
Home path template
This option specifies the UNIX home path template for new users. The '%U 'macro will replaced with the actual user name.
First UID
This options specifies the first user ID where searching for an available UID starts.
First GID
This options specifies the first group ID where searching for an available GID starts.
If this option is checked then a home directory will created for the new user.
If this option is checked then the contents of the skeleton folder will copied to the new user's home directory
If this option is enabled, new user creation will create a private group named as the user, and the primary group of the user will assigned to this private group.
Default primary group
This is the default primary group which will be assigned to a newly created user.
smin
smax
swarn
sinact
sexpire
This setting is for specifying a date when user accounts will expire.
sneverexpire
Check this if you want to user accounts never expire.
Password file
This specifies the users database file (usually / etc/ passwd).
Group file
This specifies the groups database file (usually / etc/ group).
MD5 Shadow passwords
Check this if you want the passwords in the shadow file MD5 hashed. Leave this unchecked if DES encryption should be used.
Shadow password file
Specifies the shadow password file (usually / etc/ shadow). Leave this empty if your system does not use a shadow password file.
Group shadow file
Specifies the shadow group file (usually / etc/ gshadow). Leave this empty if your system does not use a shadow group file.

LDAP User container
This specifies where to store users' entries relative to the LDAP base DN.
LDAP User filter
This specifies the filter used for user entries.
LDAP Group container
This specifies where to store groups' entries relative to the LDAP base DN.
LDAP Group filter
This specifies the filter used for group entries.
LDAP User RDN prefix
This specifies what prefix will used for user entries.
Check this if the user's full name should be stored in the cn (Canonical Name) attribute.
Update the gecos field
Check this if the gecos attribute should be updated.
Manage LDAP shadowAccount objectclass
Check this if the shadowAccount object should be used in the users' entries. It allows to enforce password change/ expiration policies.
LDAP Structural objectclass
This option allows to specify the structural objectclass used with users' entries. If you want to use these entries not just for authentication, but for an address book, too, then choose inetOrgPerson.
LDAP Group RDN prefix
This specifies what prefix will used for group entries.
LDAP Password hash method
This specifies the password hashing method. The most secure is SSHA.
Enable samba account management
Check this if you want to use the user/ group entries in a Samba domain. KUser will create sambaSamAccount objectclass for each entry which is usable with the ldapsam passdb backend with Samba version greater than 3.0.
Samba domain name
This specifies the samba domain name.
Samba domain SID
This specifies the domain Security IDentifier. It is unique in a single domain. You can query the value of the domain SID with'net getlocalsid domain_name '.
Algorithmic RID base
This value is an offset for the algorithmic mapping from uids and gids to rids. The default (and minimum) value is 1000, it must be even, and the LDAP database and smb. conf must store the same values.
Samba login script
This specifies a name of a login script (in the ` Netlogon ` share) which will be executed as the user logs in to a Windows machine.
Samba home drive
Specifies a drive letter where the user's home directory will automatically mapped when he/ she logs into a Windows machine.
Samba profile path template
This specifies the location of the roaming profile of the user. The '%U 'macro will be replaced with the actual user name.
Samba home path template
This specifies the location of the home directory of the user. This field is meaningful only for Windows machines. The '%U 'macro will be replaced with the actual user name.
Store the LanManager hashed password in the sambaLMPassword attribute. Check this if you have older clients (Win9x series and before) on your network.
