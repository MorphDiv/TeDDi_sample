EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
VIRAFERONPEG
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is ViraferonPeg?
ViraferonPeg is a medicine containing the active substance peginterferon alfa-2b.
It is available as a powder and solvent to be made up into a solution for injection, and as a single use pre-filled pen.
These all contain 50, 80, 100, 120, or 150 micrograms of peginterferon alfa-2b per 0.5 ml.
What is ViraferonPeg used for?
ViraferonPeg is used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (a disease of the liver due to infection with the hepatitis C virus).
ViraferonPeg is used in patients whose liver is still functioning but who have signs of the disease (raised transaminases [liver enzymes] and markers of infection in the blood, such as viral RNA or antibodies against the virus).
It can be used in patients also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
The best way to use ViraferonPeg is with ribavirin (an antiviral medicine).
This combination is suitable for treatment-naïve patients (who have not been treated before) and for patients in whom previous treatment including any type of interferon alfa, with or without ribavirin, did not work.
ViraferonPeg can be used alone if the patient does not tolerate or should not take ribavirin.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is ViraferonPeg used?
ViraferonPeg treatment should be initiated and supervised by a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with hepatitis C.
ViraferonPeg is given once a week as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin).
It used on its own at a dose of 0.5 or 1 microgram per kilogram body weight per week, or at a dose of 1.5 micrograms/ kg/ week when used with ribavirin.
The duration of treatment depends on the patient’ s condition and response to treatment, and ranges from 24 weeks to a year.
The dose may need to be adjusted for patients who experience side effects.
For full dosing information, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (also part of the EPAR).
ViraferonPeg has to be stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C).
How does ViraferonPeg work?
The active substance in ViraferonPeg, peginterferon alfa-2b, belongs to the group ‘ interferons’.
Interferons are natural substances produced by the body to help it fight against attacks such as infections caused by viruses.
The exact way alpha interferons work in viral diseases is not fully understood, but it is thought that they act as immunomodulators (substances that modify how the

Alpha interferons may also block the multiplication of viruses.
Peginterferon alfa-2b is similar to interferon alfa-2b, which is already available in the European Union (EU) as IntronA.
In ViraferonPeg, the interferon alfa-2b has been ‘ pegylated’ (coated with a chemical called polyethylene glycol).
This decreases the rate at which the substance is removed from the body and allows the medicine to be given less often.
The interferon alfa-2b in ViraferonPeg is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: the interferon alfa-2b is made by a bacterium that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce it.
The replacement acts in same way as naturally produced interferon alpha.
How has ViraferonPeg been studied?
The use of ViraferonPeg alone in chronic hepatitis C has been studied in one study in 1,224 treatment- naïve adult patients.
ViraferonPeg used once a week for 48 weeks (at 0.5, 1 or 1.5 micrograms/ kg) was compared with interferon alfa-2b used at 3 million international units (IU) three times a week.
The use of ViraferonPeg with ribavirin has been studied over 48 weeks in 1,580 treatment-naïve patients.
This study compared two schedules of ViraferonPeg used with ribavirin with the combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.
An additional two studies have looked at the use of ViraferonPeg in combination with ribavirin in 565 patients also infected with HIV, and a further study looked at the use of this combination in 1,354 patients whose previous treatment including interferon alfa (pegylated or non-pegylated) did not work or whose disease had come back after previous treatment.
The main measure of effectiveness was the level of hepatitis C virus RNA circulating in the blood before and during treatment, and at ‘ follow-up’, 24 weeks later.
What benefit has ViraferonPeg shown during the studies?
In the first study, ViraferonPeg was more effective than interferon alfa-2b.
More patients had no circulating viral RNA after 24 weeks of treatment with ViraferonPeg than with interferon alfa-2b:
46% with ViraferonPeg 1.5 microgram/ kg/ week compared with 24% with the comparator.
Combining ribavirin and ViraferonPeg (as a once-weekly injection of 1.5 micrograms/ kg) was more effective than the combination with interferon alfa-2b (3 million IU three times a week): more patients had responded to treatment at the end of the study (65% compared with 54%).
The combination of ViraferonPeg with ribavirin was also effective for the treatment of hepatitis C in patients also infected with HIV.
In the study of patients whose previous treatment did not work, around a fifth of the patients responded to treatment with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin.
What is the risk associated with ViraferonPeg?
The most common side effects with ViraferonPeg (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are viral infection, weight loss, depression, irritability, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), anxiety, impaired concentration, emotional lability (mood swings), headache, dry mouth, dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), pharyngitis (sore throat), coughing, vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), abdominal (tummy) pain, diarrhoea, anorexia (loss of appetite), alopecia (hair loss), pruritus (itching), dry skin, rash, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), musculoskeletal pain (pain in the muscles and bones), inflammation at the site of the injection, injection site reaction (pain and redness), dizziness, fatigue (tiredness), rigors (shaking chills), fever, flu-like symptoms and asthenia (weakness).
For the full list of all side effects reported with ViraferonPeg, see the Package Leaflet.
ViraferonPeg should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to any interferon or any of the other ingredients.
ViraferonPeg should not be used in: • patients with a history of severe heart disease, • patients with severe medical conditions, • patients with an auto-immune disease (when the body attacks itself), • patients with severe liver problems, • patients with thyroid disease unless it is controlled, • patients with epilepsy or other central nervous system problems, • HIV-infected patients with signs of serious liver disease.
In combination with ribavirin, ViraferonPeg should not be used in patients with kidney problems.
For a list of all restrictions with ViraferonPeg, see the Package Leaflet.
Why has ViraferonPeg been approved?
©EMEA 2007
2/ 3
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that ViraferonPeg’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have elevated transaminases without liver decompensation and who are positive for serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA or anti-HCV including naïve patients with clinically stable HIV co-infection.
The Committee recommended that ViraferonPeg be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about ViraferonPeg:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for ViraferonPeg to SP Europe on 29 May 2000.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 29 May 2005.
