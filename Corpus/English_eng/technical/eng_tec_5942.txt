& kde; with non-kde; applications
My non-kde; applications like & Emacs; and kterm are running amok with strange colors!
Start the kde; Control Center and in Appearance & Themes Colors uncheck the Apply colors to non-KDE applications checkbox and click Apply.
How can I set my default web browser to be something other than & konqueror;?
If you are using & kde; 3.3 or later, open up the & kcontrolcenter; and navigate to the KDE Components Component Chooser panel. Select Web Browser from the list on the left, then select Open http and https URLs in the following browser: and type in the name of the browser (eg; mozilla, firefox, opera, & etc;) in the textbox.
How can I configure the style and fonts of GTK applications within & kde;?
The simplest way to achieve this is to download and compile the gtk-qt theme engine from http: / /www. freedesktop. org/ Software/ gtk-qt. This theme engine makes your GTK applications look like your & kde; widget style by calling functions from & Qt; instead of drawing the styles itself. Once the theme engine has been installed, there will be a & kcontrolcenter; module under Appearance & Themes GTK Styles and Fonts.
