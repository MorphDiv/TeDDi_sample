(PHP 4 = 4.0.2)
pspell_config_save_repl() should be used on a config before calling pspell_new_config().
It determines whether pspell_save_wordlist() will save the replacement pairs along with the wordlist.
Usually there is no need to use this function because if pspell_config_repl() is used, the replacement pairs will be saved by pspell_save_wordlist() anyway, and if it is not, the replacement pairs will not be saved.
Please, note that this function will not work unless you have pspell .11.2 and aspell .32.5 or later.
