attributes
&quot; acute &quot; , &quot; bar &quot; , &quot; breve &quot; , &quot; check &quot; , &quot; circle &quot; , &quot; dot &quot; , &quot; ddot &quot; , &quot; dddot &quot; , &quot; grave &quot; , &quot; hat &quot; , &quot; tilde &quot; and &quot; vec &quot; have fixed sizes.

size n
,
+n
,
-n
,
*n
and
/n
, where
n
is a placeholder.
This method is useful when the base size of the formula is subject to change.
The commands
size +n
and
size -n
change point size, and
size *n
and
size /n
change the size by a percentage.
For example, the command
size *1.17
increases the size of a character by exactly 17%.
Note that some entries require spaces for the correct structure.
This is especially true when you specify attributes with fixed values instead of placeholders.
