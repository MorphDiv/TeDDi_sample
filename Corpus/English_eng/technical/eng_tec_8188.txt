1 ml solution contains 10 micrograms iloprost (as iloprost trometamol).
Each ampoule with 1 ml contains 10 micrograms iloprost.
Each ampoule with 2 ml contains 20 micrograms iloprost.
Excipient:
Ethanol 96% 0,81 mg per ml.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Nebuliser solution.
Clear, colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, classified as NYHA functional class III, to improve exercise capacity and symptoms.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Ventavis should only be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.
Ventavis is intended for inhalation use by nebulisation (see section 6.6).
Adults
• Dose per inhalation session:
The recommended dose is 2.5 micrograms or 5.0 micrograms of inhaled iloprost (as delivered at the mouthpiece of the nebuliser), starting with the low dose of 2.5 microgram for the first inhalation, followed by 5.0 micrograms for the second inhalation.
In case of poor tolerability of the 5.0 microgram dose, the dose should be reduced to 2.5 micrograms.
Two compressed air nebuliser systems, HaloLite and Prodose, have been shown to be suitable nebulisers for the administration of Ventavis.
With both systems the mass median aerodynamic diameter of the aerosol droplet (MMAD) with iloprost was between 2.6 and 2.7 micrometres.
For each inhalation session the content of one ampoule containing 2 ml of Ventavis nebuliser solution will be transferred into the nebuliser medication chamber immediately before use.
HaloLite and Prodose are dosimetric systems.
They stop automatically after the pre-set dose has been delivered.
The inhalation time depends on the patient ’ s breathing pattern.

For a dose of 5 micrograms iloprost at mouthpiece it is recommended to complete two inhalation cycles with 2.5 micrograms pre-set dose program with a filling of one ampoule containing 2 ml Ventavis nebuliser solution, which shows two coloured rings (white – pink).
Venta-Neb, a portable ultrasonic battery-powered nebuliser, has also been shown to be suitable for the administration of Ventavis.
The measured MMAD of the aerosol droplets was 2.6 micrometres.
For each inhalation session, the content of one ampoule containing 2 ml Ventavis nebuliser solution and showing two coloured rings (white – pink) will be transferred into the nebuliser medication chamber immediately before use.
Two programs can be operated:
P1 Program 1:
5.0 micrograms active substance on the mouth piece 25 inhalation cycles.
P2 Program 2:
2.5 micrograms active substance on the mouth piece 10 inhalation cycles.
The selection of the pre set program is made by the physician.
Venta-Neb prompts the patient to inhale by an optical and an acoustic signal.
It stops after the pre-set dose has been administered.
To obtain the optimal droplet size for the administration of Ventavis the green baffle plate should be used.
For details refer to the instruction manual of the Venta-Neb nebuliser.

The I-Neb AAD System is a portable, hand-held, vibrating mesh technology nebuliser system.
This system generates droplets by ultrasound, which is forcing the solution through a mesh.
The I-Neb AAD nebuliser has also been shown to be suitable for the administration of Ventavis.
The measured MMAD of the aerosol droplets was 2.1 micrometres.
This nebuliser monitors the breathing pattern to determine the aerosol pulse time required to deliver the pre-set dose of 2.5 or 5 micrograms iloprost.
The pre-set dose provided by the I-Neb AAD system is controlled by the medication chamber in combination with a control disc.
There are two different colour coded medication chambers.
For each medication chamber there is a corresponding colour coded control disc:
For the 2.5 micrograms dose the medication chamber (350 microliter) with the red latch is used together with the red control disc.
For the 5 micrograms dose the medication chamber (650 microliter) with the purple coloured latch is used together with the purple control disc.
For each inhalation session with the I-Neb AAD, the content of one 1-ml ampoule of Ventavis, showing three coloured rings (pink – red- red), will be transferred into the appropriate nebuliser medication chamber immediately before use.

Since the I-Neb nebuliser has been shown to produce an aerosol with slightly different physical characteristics to those of HaloLite, Prodose and VentaNeb devices and a faster delivery of the solution (see section 5.2), patients stabilized on one nebuliser should not switch to another nebuliser without supervision by the treating physician.
The efficacy and tolerability of inhaled iloprost when administered with other nebulising systems, which provide different nebulisation characteristics of iloprost solution, have not been established.
• Daily dose:
The dose per inhalation session should be administered 6 to 9 times per day according to the individual need and tolerability.
• Duration of treatment:
The duration of treatment depends on clinical status and is left to the physician’ s discretion.
Should patients deteriorate on this treatment intravenous prostacyclin treatment should be considered.
Patients with hepatic impairment
Iloprost elimination is reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction (see section 5.2).
To avoid undesired accumulation over the day, special caution has to be exercised with these patients during initial dose titration.
Initially, doses of 2.5 micrograms should be administered with dosing intervals of at least 3 hours (corresponds to administration of max.
6 times per day).
Thereafter, dosing intervals may be shortened cautiously based on individual tolerability.
If a further increase in the dose up to 5.0 micrograms is indicated, again dosing intervals of at least 3 hours should be chosen initially and shortened according to individual tolerability.
A further undesired accumulation of the medicinal product following treatment over several days is not likely due to the overnight break in administration of the medicinal product.
Patients with renal impairment
There is no need for dose adaptation in patients with a creatinine clearance > 30 ml/ min (as determined from serum creatinine using the Cockroft and Gault formula).
Patients with a creatinine clearance of ≤ 30 ml/ min were not investigated in the clinical trials.
Children and adolescents
There is no experience with Ventavis in children or adolescents.
4.3 Contraindications
− Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. − Conditions where the effects of Ventavis on platelets might increase the risk of haemorrhage (e. g. active peptic ulcers, trauma, intracranial haemorrhage). − Severe coronary heart disease or unstable angina; − Myocardial infarction within the last six months; − Decompensated cardiac failure if not under close medical supervision;
4 − Severe arrhythmias; cerebrovascular events (e. g. transient ischaemic attack, stroke) within the last 3 months. − Pulmonary hypertension due to venous occlusive disease. − Congenital or acquired valvular defects with clinically relevant myocardial function disorders not related to pulmonary hypertension. − Pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.6).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The use of Ventavis is not recommended in patients with unstable pulmonary hypertension, with advanced right heart failure.
In case of deterioration or worsening of right heart failure transfer to other medicinal products should be considered.
The pulmonary vasodilatory effect of inhaled iloprost is of short duration (one to two hours).
Patients who experience syncope in association with pulmonary hypertension should avoid any exceptional straining, for example during physical exertion.
Before physical exertion it might be useful to inhale.
The occurrence of a nocturnal or exertional syncope reflects therapeutic gaps and/ or insufficient efficiency, and the need to adapt and/ or change the therapy should be considered (see section 4.8).
Ventavis inhalation might entail the risk of inducing bronchospasm, especially in patients with bronchial hyperactivity (see section 4.8 Undesirable effects).
Moreover, the benefit of Ventavis has not been established in patients with concomitant Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and severe asthma.
Patients with concomitant acute pulmonary infections, COPD and severe asthma should be carefully monitored.
In patients with low systemic blood pressure, care should be taken to avoid further hypotension.
Ventavis should not be initiated in patients with systolic arterial hypotension less than 85 mmHg.
Should signs of pulmonary oedema occur when inhaled iloprost is administered in patients with pulmonary hypertension, the possibility of associated pulmonary veno-occlusive disease should be considered.
The treatment should be stopped.
In case of interruption of Ventavis therapy, the risk of rebound effect is not formally excluded.
Careful monitoring of the patient should be performed, when inhaled iloprost therapy is stopped and an alternative treatment should be considered in critically ill patients.
Iloprost elimination is reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in patients with renal failure requiring dialysis (see section 5.2).
A cautious initial dose titration using dosing intervals of at least 3 hours is recommended (see section 4.2).
Prolonged oral treatment with iloprost clathrate in dogs up to one year was associated with slightly increased fasted serum glucose levels.
It cannot be excluded that this is also relevant to man on prolonged Ventavis therapy.
To minimise accidental exposure, it is recommended to use Ventavis with nebulisers with inhalation- triggered systems (HaloLite/ Prodose), and to keep the room well ventilated.
Ventavis nebuliser solution should not come into contact with skin and eyes; oral ingestion of Ventavis solution should be avoided.
During nebulisation sessions a facial mask must be avoided and only a mouthpiece should be used.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Iloprost may increase the effect of vasodilatators and antihypertensive agents.
5 Iloprost can inhibit platelet function and its use with anticoagulants (such as heparin, coumarin-type anticoagulants) or other inhibitors of platelet aggregation (such as acetylsalicylic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products, ticlopidine, clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa antagonists: abciximab, eptifibatide and tirofiban) may increase the risk of bleeding.
A careful monitoring of the patients taking anticoagulants according to common medical practice is recommended.
The concomitant use of other platelet inhibitors should be avoided in patients taking anticoagulants.
Intravenous infusion of iloprost has no effect either on the pharmacokinetics of multiple oral doses of digoxin or on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in patients.
Although, clinical studies have not been conducted, in vitro studies investigating the inhibitory potential of iloprost on the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes revealed that no relevant inhibition of drug metabolism via these enzymes by iloprost have to be expected.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of Ventavis in pregnant women.
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Ventavis is contra- indicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).
Women of child-bearing potential should use effective contraceptive measures during treatment.
It is not known whether Ventavis enters the breast milk.
The medicinal product must not be administered to breast feeding mothers (see section 4.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Care should be exercised during initiation of therapy until any effects on the individual have been determined.
In patients experiencing hypotensive symptoms such as dizziness, the abilityto drive or operate machines may be affected.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In addition to local effects resulting from administration of iloprost by inhalation such as increased cough, adverse reactions with iloprost are related to the pharmacological properties of prostacyclins.
The most common adverse reactions seen in clinical trials include vasodilatation, hypotension, headache and increased cough.
Frequencies of adverse reactions are reported as follows: very common ≥ 1/ 10; common ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10; uncommon ≥ 1/ 1,000 and < 1/ 100; rare ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000; very rare < 1/ 10,000.
The table below reports adverse reactions by MedDRA system organ classes (MedDRA SOCs).
The incidences are based on clinical trial data.
6 Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
System organ class
Very common
Common
Nervous system disorders
Headache
Vascular disorders
Vasodilatation, Hypotension
Syncope, Dizziness related to hypotension
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders
Cough increased
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders
Pain in jaw/ trismus
Syncope is a common symptom of the disease itself, but can also occur under therapy.
The increased occurrence of syncopes can be related to the deterioration of the disease or insufficient effectiveness of the product (see section 4.4).
Peripheral oedema is a very common symptom of the disease itself, but can also occur under therapy.
The occurrence of peripheral oedema can be related to the deterioration of the disease or insufficient effectiveness of the product.
Bleeding events (mostly haematoma) were common as expected in this patient population with a high proportion of patients taking anticoagulant co-medication.
The frequency of bleeding events did not differ between iloprost and placebo-treated patients.
Post marketing experience
Vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea and dyspnoea have been reported in association with Ventavis inhalation.
Bronchospasm and wheezing have also been reported in patients treated with Ventavis inhalation (see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use).
Adverse events in healthy volunteers
In a randomized placebo-controlled study in 160 healthy volunteers, inhaled doses of iloprost solution were given either with a fixed dose of 2.5 micrograms iloprost 6 times daily (total daily dose of 15 micrograms), or beginning with 5.0 microgram and increasing up to 20 micrograms, or the highest tolerated dose for a total of 6 dose inhalations (total daily dose of 70 micrograms).
In the fixed dose group of 2.5 micrograms per inhalation chest pain, or chest discomfort (32.5%), pharyngolaryngeal pain, or throat irritation (22.5%) and nausea (7.5%) – (all non-serious and mild in intensity) – occurred more frequently in comparison with the adverse events obtained from the placebo controlled phase II and III studies in patients with doses of 2.5 micrograms or 5 micrograms per inhalation.
Five volunteers were unable to increase the dose up to 20 micrograms per inhalation because of mild to moderate transient chest pain or chest discomfort, usually accompanied by headache, dizziness and nausea.
7 4.9 Overdose
• Symptoms
No case of overdose has been reported.
Hypotensive/ vasovagal reaction might be anticipated as well as headache, flushing, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.
• Therapy
A specific antidote is not known.
Interruption of the inhalation session, monitoring and symptomatic measures are recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin, ATC code:
B01AC11
This medicinal product has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.
Iloprost, the active substance of Ventavis, is a synthetic prostacyclin analogue.
The following pharmacological effects have been observed in vitro:
• Inhibition of platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion and release reaction
• Dilatation of arterioles and venules
• Increase of capillary density and reduction of increased vascular permeability caused by mediators such as serotonin or histamine in the microcirculation
• Stimulation of endogenous fibrinolytic potential
The pharmacological effects after inhalation of Ventavis are:
Direct vasodilatation of the pulmonary arterial bed occur with consecutive significant improvement of pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac output as well as mixed venous oxygen saturation.
No clinical trial data are available comparing directly in intra-patient observations the acute haemodynamic response after intravenous to that after inhaled iloprost.
The haemodynamics observed suggest an acute response with preferential effect of inhaled treatment on the pulmonary vessels.
The pulmonary vasodilatory effect of each single inhalation levels off within one to two hours.
However, the predictive value of these acute haemodynamic data are considered to be of limited value as acute response does not in all cases correlate with long-term benefit of treatment with inhaled iloprost.
• Efficacy in adult patients with pulmonary hypertension
8 A randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled phase III trial (study RRA02997) has been conducted in 203 adult patients (inhaled iloprost:
N=101; placebo n=102) with stable pulmonary hypertension.
Inhaled iloprost (or placebo) was added to patients' current therapy, which could include a combination of anticoagulants, vasodilators (e. g. calcium channel blockers), diuretics, oxygen, and digitalis, but not PGI2 (prostacyclin or its analogues).
108 of the patients included were diagnosed with primary pulmonary hypertension, 95 were diagnosed with secondary pulmonary hypertension of which 56 were associated with chronic thromboembolic disease, 34 with connective tissue disease (including CREST and scleroderma) and 4 were considered appetite suppressant drug related.
The baseline 6-minute walk test values reflected a moderate exercise limitation: in the iloprost group the mean was 332 meters (median value:
340 meters) and in the placebo group the mean was 315 meters (median value:
321 meters).
In the iloprost group, the median daily inhaled dose was 30 micrograms (range 12.5 to 45 micrograms/ day).
The primary efficacy endpoint defined for this study, was a combined response criterion consisting of improvement in exercise capacity (6 minute walk test) at 12 weeks by at least 10% versus baseline, and improvement by at least one NYHA class at 12 weeks versus baseline, and no deterioration of pulmonary hypertension or death at any time before 12 weeks.
The rate of responders to iloprost was 16.8% (17/ 101) and the rate of responders in the placebo group was 4.9% (5/ 102) (p=0.007).
In the iloprost group, the mean change from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment in the 6 minute walking distance was an increase of 22 meters (-3.3 meters in the placebo group, no data imputation for death or missing values).
In the iloprost group the NYHA class was improved in 26% of patients (placebo:
15%) (p = 0.032), unchanged in 67.7% of patients (placebo:
76%) and deteriorated in 6.3% of patients (placebo:
9%).
Invasive haemodynamic parameters were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks treatment.
A subgroup analysis showed that no treatment effect was observed as compared to placebo on the 6-minute walk test in the subgroup of patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension.
A mean increase in the 6-minute walk test of 44.7 meters from a baseline mean value of 329 meters vs. a change of -7.4 meters from a baseline mean value of 324 meters in the placebo group (no data imputation for death or missing values) was observed in the subgroup of 49 patients with primary pulmonary hypertension receiving treatment of inhaled iloprost for 12 weeks (46 patients in the placebo group).
No study has been performed with Ventavis in children with pulmonary hypertension.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
• Absorption
When iloprost is administered via inhalation in patients with pulmonary hypertension (iloprost dose at the mouthpiece:
5 micrograms), peak serum levels of 100 to 200 picograms/ ml were observed at the end of inhalation session.
These levels decline with half-lives between approximately 5 and 25 minutes.
Within 30 minutes to 1 hour after the end of inhalation, iloprost is not detectable in the central compartment (limit of quantification 25 picograms/ ml).
• Distribution
No studies performed following inhalation.
Following intravenous infusion, the apparent steady-state volume of distribution was 0.6 to 0.8 l/ kg in healthy subjects.
Total plasma protein binding of iloprost is concentration-independent in the range of 30 to 3000 picograms/ ml and amounts to approximately 60%, of which 75% is due to albumin binding.
9 • Metabolism
No studies performed following inhalation.
Iloprost is extensively metabolised principally via ß-oxidation of the carboxyl side chain.
No unchanged substance is eliminated.
The main metabolite is tetranor-iloprost, which is found in the urine in free and conjugated form in 4 diastereoisomers.
Tetranor-iloprost is pharmacologically inactive as shown in animal experiments.
Results of in vitro studies reveal that CYP 450-dependent metabolism plays only a minor role in the biotransformation of iloprost.
Further in vitro studies suggest that metabolism of iloprost in the lungs is similar after intravenous administration or inhalation.
• Elimination
No studies performed following inhalation.
In subjects with normal renal and hepatic function, the disposition of iloprost following intravenous infusion is characterised in most cases by a two-phase profile with mean half-lives of 3 to 5 minutes and 15 to 30 minutes.
A mass-balance study was done using 3H-iloprost in healthy subjects.
Following intravenous infusion, the recovery of total radioactivity is 81%, and the respective recoveries in urine and faeces are 68% and 12%.
The metabolites are eliminated from plasma and urine in 2 phases, for which half-lives of about 2 and 5 hours (plasma) and 2 and 18 hours (urine) have been calculated.
• Pharmacokinetics after use with different nebulisers
In a randomized, crossover study with 20 healthy adult men, pharmacokinetics was investigated following inhalation of Ventavis (5 mcg iloprost) by the I-Neb AAD in comparison to the ProDose (5 mcg disk).
Higher maximum serum level (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC(0-tlast)) as well as a shorter time to reach maximum serum concentration (tmax) were found following Ventavis inhalation via the I-Neb AAD in comparison to the ProDose nebulizer.
The pharmacokinetic results reflect the slightly different in vitro characteristics of these nebulizers (see Section 4.2).

10 • Characteristics in patients
Renal dysfunction:
In a study with intravenous infusion of iloprost, patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing intermittent dialysis treatment are shown to have a significantly lower clearance (mean CL = 5 ± 2 ml/ minute/ kg) than that observed in patients with renal failure not undergoing intermittent dialysis treatment (mean CL = 18 ± 2 ml/ minute/ kg).
Hepatic dysfunction:
Because iloprost is extensively metabolised by the liver, the plasma levels of the active substance are influenced by changes in hepatic function.
In an intravenous study, results were obtained involving 8 patients suffering from liver cirrhosis.
The mean clearance of iloprost is estimated to be 10 ml/ minute/ kg.
Age and gender:
Age and gender are not of clinical relevance to the pharmacokinetics of iloprost.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
• Systemic toxicity
In acute toxicity studies, single intravenous and oral doses of iloprost caused severe symptoms of intoxication or death (IV) at doses about two orders of magnitude above the intravenous therapeutic dose.
Considering the high pharmacological potency of iloprost and the absolute doses required for therapeutic purposes the results obtained in acute toxicity studies do not indicate a risk of acute adverse effects in humans.
As expected for a prostacyclin, iloprost produced haemodynamic effects (vasodilatation, reddening of skin, hypotension, inhibition of platelet function, respiratory distress) and general signs of intoxication such as apathy, gait disturbances, and postural changes.
Continuous IV/ SC infusion of iloprost up to 26 weeks in rodents and non-rodents did not cause any organ toxicity at dose levels which exceeded the human therapeutic systemic exposure between 14 and 47 times (based on plasma levels).
Only expected pharmacological effects like hypotension, reddening of skin, dyspnoea, increased intestinal motility were observed.
Based on Cmax values in rats the systemic exposure in these parenteral studies was approximately 3.5 times higher than the maximum achievable exposure after inhalation.
This highest achievable dose of 48.7 micrograms/ kg/ day was also the “ no observed adverse effect level” (NOAEL) as evaluated in inhalation toxicity studies in rats up to 26 weeks.
Following inhalation the systemic exposure based on AUC values in rats exceeded the corresponding therapeutic exposure in human patients by approximately 13 times.
• Genotoxic potential, tumorigenicity
Iloprost is not a gene mutagen in bacterial and mammalian cells in vitro and is not clastogenic in human lymphocytes up to cytotoxic concentrations and in the micronucleus test in vivo.
No tumorigenic potential of iloprost could be demonstrated in tumorigenicity studies in rats and mice.
• Reproduction toxicology
In embryo- and foetotoxicity studies in rats continuous intravenous administration of iloprost led to anomalies of single phalanges of the forepaws in a few foetuses/ pups without dose dependence.
11 These alterations are not considered as true teratogenic effects, but are most likely related to iloprost induced growth retardation in late organogenesis due to haemodynamic alterations in the foetoplacental unit.
In comparable embryotoxicity studies in rabbits and monkeys no such digit anomalies or other gross-structural abnormalities were observed in the foetuses/ pups up to the highest tested dose.
In rats, passage of extremely low levels of iloprost into the milk was observed.
• Local tolerance, contact sensitising and antigenicity potential
In inhalation studies in rats, the administration of an iloprost formulation with a concentration of 20 micrograms/ ml up to 26 weeks did not cause any local irritation of the upper and lower respiratory tract.
A dermal sensitisation (maximisation test) and an antigenicity study in guinea pigs showed no sensitising potential.

Further information
1.
WHAT VENTAVIS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
What Ventavis is:
Ventavis is a nebuliser solution.
The solution is changed into an aerosol mist by a special machine called a nebuliser.
Breathing in the mist carries Ventavis to the lungs, where it can work most effectively in the artery between heart and lungs.
How Ventavis works:
Ventavis imitates a natural substance in the body called prostacyclin.
Ventavis and prostacyclin inhibit unwanted blocking or narrowing of blood vessels and allow more blood to flow through the arteries.
What Ventavis is used for:
Ventavis is used to treat moderate cases of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH).
This is a condition where blood pressure is too high in the blood vessels between the heart and the lungs.
Ventavis tends to lower blood pressure within the pulmonary artery, by improving blood flow.
This means less work for the heart.
Improved blood flow leads to an improved supply of oxygen to the body and reduced strain on the heart.
The heart can function more effectively.
29 2.
BEFORE YOU USE VENTAVIS
Do not use Ventavis:
If you think any of the following may apply to you, please tell your doctor:
• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to iloprost or any of the other ingredients of Ventavis. • If you are at risk of bleeding – for example, active stomach ulcers, injuries, or other bleeding • If you have a significant suspected build-up of fluid in the lungs, with difficulty in breathing • If your disease is due to a blocked or narrow vein rather than a blocked or narrow artery. • If you have had a stroke within the last 3 months, or any other interruption of blood supply to the brain • If you have a heart problem, for example:
- a heart attack within the last six months
- severe changes in heart rate
- you sometimes have chest pain
- poor blood flow to the muscles of the heart (coronary heart disease)
-
any disease of the heart which is not being treated or not under close medical observation
-
a heart defect has been diagnosed, such as a faulty heart valve that causes the heart to work poorly.
• If you are pregnant or breast-feeding (see section 2., Take special care, ‘ Pregnancy, ‘ Breast-feeding’).
Take special care with Ventavis:
- If you have infection of the lungs, severe asthma, or other lung disease.
Inhaling Ventavis
might trigger breathing difficulties. − If your blood pressure is too low (less than 85 mmHg) you should not start the therapy with Ventavis.
You will need special medical observation in some cases:
- In general, you will need to take special care to try and avoid fainting or other effects of low
blood pressure, such as dizziness: • Stand up slowly when you get out of chairs or bed.
You will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure • If you tend to faint as soon as you get out of bed, it may be helpful to take your first dose of the day while you’ re still lying down. • Avoid any exceptional straining, for example physical exertion; it might be useful to inhale Ventavis before. such physical exertion • Have someone on standby to watch you, if possible.
Warn them to call a doctor if you faint.
The doctor will give advice on what to do and possibly prescribe treatment • If fainting episodes get worse because of the underlying disease, tell your doctor.
The doctor may consider a change of treatment.
- If you have liver problems, you may be prescribed a lower dose of Ventavis than for other
patients
- If you have very severe kidney problems, see your doctor.
- If your overall condition becomes worse, see your doctor.
If you are under 18 years, please make your doctor aware of your age.
Ventavis has not yet been tested in children and adolescents.
30 Taking other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Ventavis and certain other medicines may influence each other in the way they work in your body.
Be specially careful to mention any of these: • Medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart disease • Medicines which inhibit blood clotting (this includes acetylsalicylic acid a substance present in many medicines that lower fever and relieve pain, as well as others) Your doctor or pharmacist has more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid when using Ventavis, so always tell them if you are taking other medicines.
Pregnancy:
• If you are pregnant, or think you might be, tell your doctor straight away.
Ventavis must not be used by pregnant women (see section 2.
Do not use Ventavis). • If you could get pregnant, use reliable contraception from the time you start treatment and during treatment (ask your doctor).
Breast-feeding:
Stop breast-feeding when you start Ventavis treatment.
Ventavis must not be given to women who are breast-feeding, since it is not known whether the active substance is passed on through breast milk.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Newborns, infants, and pregnant women should not be subjected to Ventavis in the room air.
These persons should not remain in a closed room where Ventavis is being administered to a patient.
Driving and using machines:
Ventavis brings down blood pressure and may cause dizziness or light-headedness in some people.
Do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel these effects of low blood pressure.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Ventavis:
This medicinal product contains small amounts (less than 100 mg per dose) of ethanol (alcohol).
3.
HOW TO USE VENTAVIS
How to use Ventavis:
Always take Ventavis exactly as your doctor has told you.
Ventavis nebuliser solution is inhaled using the nebulisers your doctor prescribed (either the HaloLite, the Prodose, the Venta-Neb or the I-Neb AAD system).
The nebuliser turns Ventavis solution into a mist which you breathe in through your mouth.
Follow carefully any extra instructions that come with the nebuliser.
Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure.
Ventavis solution that you do not use in one inhalation session has to be thrown away.
31 How much to inhale:
The dose of Ventavis that is right for you depends on your individual condition and will be worked out by your doctor.
Most people will have 6 to 9 inhalation sessions spread throughout the day.
One inhalation session will usually last about 4 to 10 minutes depending on the prescribed dose.
In case of liver problems, your doctor will introduce you to Ventavis gradually and possibly prescribe fewer daily inhalations.
If you have the impression that the effect of Ventavis is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
For HaloLite and ProDose systems:
Just before you start to inhale, break open the glass container containing 2 ml solution, which shows two coloured rings (white-pink), and transfer the complete contents into the nebuliser medication chamber.
You should run the inhalation cycle twice if you require a high dose (5 micrograms) and once if you require a low dose (2.5 micrograms).
Independent of the dose the filling volume is always the contents of one glass container.
The inhalation time depends on your breathing pattern.

The pre-set dose provided by the I-Neb AAD system is controlled by the medication chamber in combination with a control disc.
There are two different colour coded medication chambers.
For each medication chamber there is a corresponding colour coded control disc:
For the 2.5 micrograms dose the medication chamber (350 microliter) with the red latch is used together with the red control disc.
32 For the 5 micrograms dose the medication chamber (650 microliter) with the purple coloured latch is used together with the purple control disc.
You should make sure that you use the medication chamber with the red latch for the 2.5 micrograms dose or the medication chamber with the purple latch for the 5 micrograms dose.
You should make also sure that the colour of the medication chamber latch fits with the colour of the control disc used in order to receive the prescribed dose.

For further details please refer to the instruction manual of the nebuliser device or ask your doctor.
Ask your doctor to have someone help you become thoroughly familiar with the use of the nebuliser.
You should not switch to another nebuliser without consulting your treating doctor.
Caution:
Do not let Ventavis solution come into contact with your skin or eyes.
If it does, rinse the skin or your eyes immediately with water.
Do not drink Ventavis solution.
If drinking accidentally occurs, drink plenty of water and talk to a doctor.
Drinking Ventavis could also lead to a temporary overdose – see “ If you take more Ventavis than you should”.
If you use more Ventavis than you should:
Using more Ventavis than you should may lead to a decrease in blood pressure with symptoms like dizziness or fainting.
You may also experience headache, reddening of the face (flushing), feeling sick (nausea), vomiting or diarrhoea.
If this happens: • Stop the inhalation session • Talk to your doctor
See also section 2, Take special care with Ventavis, for advice on what you have to do if you have low blood pressure or fainting episodes.
If you forget to take a dose:
You should not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
Please ask your doctor what you should do.
If you stop taking Ventavis:
If you stop or wish to stop treatment, you should discuss this with your doctor first.
Room ventilation:
Be sure to ventilate or air the room in which you have taken your Ventavis treatment.
Other persons might accidentally be exposed to Ventavis through the room air.
In particular, newborns, infants, and pregnant women should not be subjected to Ventavis.

Instructions for use and handling
Two compressed air nebuliser systems, HaloLite and Prodose, have been shown to be suitable nebulisers for the administration of Ventavis.
For each inhalation session the content of one ampoule containing 2 ml of Ventavis nebuliser solution will be transferred into the nebuliser medication chamber immediately before use.
HaloLite and Prodose are dosimetric systems.
They stop automatically after the pre-set dose has been delivered.
The inhalation time depends on the patient’ s breathing pattern.

For a dose of 5 micrograms iloprost at mouthpiece it is recommended to complete two inhalation cycles with 2.5 micrograms pre-set dose program with a filling of one ampoule containing 2 ml Ventavis nebuliser solution, which shows two coloured rings (white – pink).
For details refer to the instruction manuals of the HaloLite and Prodose nebuliser.
VentaNeb, a portable ultrasonic battery-powered nebuliser, has also been shown to be suitable for the administration of Ventavis.
The measured MMAD of the aerosol droplets was 2.6 micrometres.
For each inhalation session, the content of one ampoule containing 2 ml of Ventavis nebuliser solution and showing two coloured rings (white – pink) will be transferred into the nebuliser medication chamber immediately before use.
Two programs can be operated:
P1 Program 1:
5,0 micrograms active substance on the mouth piece 25 inhalation cycles.
P2 Program 2:
2,5 micrograms active substance on the mouth piece 10 inhalation cycles.
The selection of the pre set program is made by the physician.
VentaNeb prompts the patient to inhale by an optical and an acoustic signal.
It stops after the pre-set dose has been administered.
To obtain the optimal droplet size for the administration of Ventavis the green baffle plate should be used.
For details refer to the instruction manual of the Venta-Neb nebuliser.

The I-Neb AAD System is a portable, hand-held, vibrating mesh technology nebuliser system, This system generates droplets by ultrasound, which is forcing the solution through a mesh.
The I-Neb AAD nebuliser has also been shown to be suitable for the administration of Ventavis.
The measured MMAD of the aerosol droplets was 2.1 micrometres.
37 This nebuliser monitors the breathing pattern to determine the aerosol pulse time required to deliver the pre-set dose of 2.5 or 5 micrograms iloprost.
The pre-set dose provided by the I-Neb AAD system is controlled by the medication chamber and in combination with a control disc.
There are two different colour coded medication chambers.
For each medication chamber there is a corresponding colour coded control disc:

Since the I-Neb nebuliser has been shown to produce an aerosol with slightly different physical characteristics to those of HaloLite, Prodose and VentaNeb devices and a faster delivery of the solution, patients stabilized on one nebuliser should not switch to another nebuliser without supervision by the treating physician.
The efficacy and tolerability of inhaled iloprost when administered with other nebulising systems, which provide different nebulisation characteristics of iloprost solution, have not been established.
