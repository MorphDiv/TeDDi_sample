(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns the column data.
If an error occurs, FALSE is returned and ora_errorcode() will return a non-zero value.
Note, however, that a test for FALSE on the results from this function may be TRUE in cases where there is not error as well (NULL result, empty string, the number 0, the string "0").
Fetches the data for a column or function result.
