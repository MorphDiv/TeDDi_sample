Introduction

This new version includes two types of robots, movable junkheaps, multiple game configurations, user definable keyboard layouts, and sound, as well as all of the features which were present in the original GNOME Robots game.

GNOME Robots Objective
The objective of GNOME Robots is quite simple. You are surrounded by a number of robots or other hostile adversaries. As you move about they will move directly towards you for every move that you make. Their goal is to kill you. Your goal is to kill all the robots on the board by taking advantage of their vulnerabilities.
Robots are destroyed when they collide with each other, or when they collide with the debris of some previous collision. You die if a robot ends up right next to you.
In some of the game configurations (you can choose from five different sets of rules), you can push the junkheaps around to form barricades to protect you. Also, if you are daring enough, you can Splat! the robots by pushing junkheaps on top of them for an additional bonus.
You can also save yourself by teleporting yourself to a random location. Unfortunately, randomly teleporting means that you might end up being right next to a robot, so they can kill you when they make their move. Luckily, there are also safe teleports which will place you out of immediate danger, but there are only a limited supply of them. You can earn more free teleports as you go along (how you gain them depends on the chosen game), but typically you get one for each robot that is destroyed while you are 'waiting', up to a maximum of 10. If you don't want to waste your saved-up safe teleports, you can choose to teleport randomly if you think it's safe enough.
If you press the
If you manage to reach the point where more than half of the screen is occupied by robots, the number of robots will be reset to the starting amount, allowing you to continue.

Customizing GNOME Robots
The safe moves option will help you to avoid being killed due to a mistake. If you try to make a move that would lead to your death when there is a safe move available, you will not be allowed to proceed. But be warned: if there was no safe move available, other than teleporting, the move will be allowed to proceed.
There is also a

Each character is 16x16 pixels and there are 14 of them arranged in a PNG file which is 224x16 pixels in size. You can look at the existing files to see the order in which they must be arranged to produce the correct animated sequences.
Any graphics files which are placed in the directory are auto-detected, so you don't need to alter any configuration files. You can also define your own game configurations by creating extra
