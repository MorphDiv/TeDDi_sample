Overview
From left to right: original image, map, resulting image
Map has three stripes: a solid black area, a vertical gradient area, a solid white area. One can see, on the resulting image, that image zones corresponding to solid areas of the map, are not blurred. Only the image zone corresponding to the gradient area of the map is blurred.

It uses a blur map. Unlike other maps, this filter doesn't use grey levels of this blur map.
Activate the filter
You can find this filter through
Options

To create a blur, check
To create a texture, check
Convolution
You can use two types of convolution. That's the first parameter you have to set:


Effect Image
That's the map for blur or pattern direction. This map must have the same dimensions as the original image. It must be preferably a grayscale image. It must be present on your screen when you call filter so that you can choose it in the drop-list.
Blurring with vertical gradient map
With a vertical gradient map, vertical lines are blurred.
Blurring with a square gradient map
The gradient map is divided into four gradient triangles: each of them has its own gradient direction. In every area of the image corresponding to gradient triangles, only lines with the same direction as gradient are blurred.
Texture example

Filter Length
When applying blur, this option controls how important blur is. When creating a texture, it controls how rough texture is: low values result in smooth surface; high values in rough surface.
Action example of Filter Length on blur
On the left: a vertical line, one pixel wide (zoom 800%). On the right: the same line, after applying a vertical blur with a Filter Length to 3. You can see that blur width is 6 pixels, 3 pixels on both sides.
Filter Length example on texture
On the left: a texture with Filter Length=3. On the right, the same texture with Filter Length=24.
Noise Magnitude
This options controls the amount and size of White Noise. Low values produce finely grained surfaces. High values produce coarse-grained textures.
Action example of Noise Magnitude on texture
Noise magnitude = 4
Integration Steps
This options controls the influence of gradient map on texture.
Action example of Integration Steps on texture
On the left: Integration Steps = 2. On the right: Integration Steps = 4.
Minimum/Maximum values
Both values determine a range controlling texture contrast: shrunk range results in high contrast and enlarged range results in low contrast.
Action example of Min/max values on texture
Minimum value = -4.0. Maximum value = 5.0.

Photocopy
Example for the
Filter
The Photocopy filter modifies the active layer or selection so that it looks like a black and white photocopy, as if toner transferred was based on the relative darkness of a particular region. This is achieved by darkening areas of the image which are measured to be darker than a neighborhood average, and setting other pixels to white.
You may use this filter to sharpen your image. Create a copy of the active layer and use the filter on the copy. Set the
You can find this filter from the image menu through

Mask radius
This parameter controls the size of the pixel neighbourhood over which the average intensity is computed and then compared to each pixel in the neighborhood to decide whether or not to darken it. Large values result in very thick black areas bordering the regions of white and much less detail for black areas. Small values result in less toner overall and more details everywhere.
With this option, you can set photocopy sharpness, from 0.0 to 1.0.
Percent black
This parameter controls the amount of black color added to the image. Small values make the blend from color regions to blackened areas smoother and dark lines themselves thinner and less noticeable. Larger values make the lines thicker, darker and sharper. The maximum value makes the lines aliased. The best, most natural results are usually achieved with an intermediate value. Values vary from 0.0 to 1.0.
Percent White
This parameter increases white pixels percentage.

Example for the
Filter
The Cubism plug-in modifies the image so that it appears to be constructed of small squares of semitransparent tissue paper.
If setting possibilities of this filter are not enough for you, see
You can find this filter through

Tile Size
This variable determines the size, in pixels, of the squares to be used. This is, in effect, the size of the little squares of tissue paper used in generating the new image. The slider can be used, the exact pixel size can be entered into the text box, or the arrow buttons can be used.
Tile Saturation
This variable specifies how intense the color of the squares should be. This affects the opacity of the squares. A high value will render the squares very intensely and does not allow lower squares to show through. A lower value allows the lower squares to be more visible through the higher ones and causes more blending in the colors. If this is set to 0 and Use Background Color is not checked, the entire layer will be rendered black. If it is checked and the value here is zero, the background color will fill the entire layer.
Use Background color
This filter creates its tiles from all the colors of the image and paint them with a color scale which depends on the Tile Saturation. With a low Tile Saturation, this color scale lets the background color appear: default is black as you can see by setting Tile Saturation to 0. When this option is checked, the background color of the Toolbox is used. If your image has an Alpha channel, this color scale will also be transparent.

GIMPressionist
Example for the
Filter
It's the king of Artistic filters. It can do what Cubism and Apply Canvas do and much more. It gives your image the look of a painting. All is going as if your image was painted again on a paper and with a brush you'd have chosen. It works on the active layer or selection.
Activating the filter
You can find this filter via the image menu through
Parameter Settings
All your setting changes will appear in the Preview without affecting the image until you click on
Presets

GIMPressionist has a lot of parameters. When combined, they give an astronomical number of possibilities. So, it is important, when an interesting preset has been found, to save it and also to send it to the plugin author if exceptional. Per contra, the intricacy of all these parameters makes difficult understanding and foreseeing how each one works.




Paper tab

This tab concerns the texture of the canvas your image will be painted on. You have a list of textures and a
Invert
Inverts the paper texture: what was a hollow turns to a bump and vice-versa.
Overlay
Apply the paper as it, without embossing it. It looks like if a transparent paper has been overlayed on the image.
Scale
Specifies the scale of the texture (in % of the original file): controls the graininess of the texture.
Relief
Specifies the amount of embossing to apply (3-150).
Brush tab


Gamma
Changes the gamma (luminosity) of the selected brush. The gamma correction brightens or darkens midtones.
Select
You can also use a brush pattern you have created by selecting its image (arrow button on the Select line). This image must be on your screen before you launch the filter to be taken in account. Of course, don't use big images.
If your image has several layers, they also will be displayed in the Select list and can be used as a brush. When selected, the layer appears in the brush preview and the normal brush is deselected.
The
Aspect ratio
Specifies the brush proportions, height (0 -1) and width (0 +1).
Specifies the amount of paint used for each stroke. This may evoke painting with a palette knife.
Orientation tab

This tab allows to set the orientation of the brush strokes. A painter is not obliged to go over with the same paintbrush angle. To perform some effects, he can vary their orientation.
Directions
With this option, you can set how many times the brush will pass through a same place, with each time a different direction, resulting in a more and more thick paint.
Start Angle
Specifies the general direction of the strokes, the angle that the angle range will start from. Directions are often chosen to give some movement to the image.
Angle Span
Specifies the angle, the sector, of the stroke "fan".
Orientation
Specifies the direction of the brush strokes.








Size tab

This tab allows you to set the number of brush sizes that will be used to paint, the limits of variation of these sizes and the criterion used to determine them.
Three Sliders
You can specify how many brush sizes are to be used and their sizes.


Sizes
You have there options to specify how the size of strokes will be determined.








Placement tab

In this tab you can set how strokes will be distributed.
Placement
In the preview of the Orientation Map Editor, all small arrows look like a flow around objects. Inside this flow, strokes may be placed in two different ways:


Stroke Density
The greater the density the closer the strokes. With a low density, the paper or background may be visible in unstroke areas.
Centerize
Focus brush strokes around center.
Color tab

In this tab, you can set what the stroke color will be.
Color
You can set the stroke color in two ways:


Color Noise
This slider, and its input box, allow you to introduce noise in the stroke color, that will look less homogeneous.
General tab

In this tab you can set what will be the background and the relief of brush strokes.
Background




Paint Edges
If it is disabled, a thin border will not be painted around the outside border of the image.
Tileable
If checked, the resulting image will be seamlessly tileable. The right side will match the left side and the top will match the bottom. This is interesting if your image will be repeatedly used in a Web background.
Drop Shadow
Add a shadow effect to each brush stroke.
Edge Darken
How much to darken the edges of each brush stroke. This increases paint relief or thickness.
Shadow Darken
How much to darken the brush shadow.
Shadow Depth
How far apart from the object the drop shadow should be.
Shadow Blur
How much to blur the drop shadow.
Deviation Threshold
A bail-out value for adaptive selections of brush size.
