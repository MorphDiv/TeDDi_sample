GNOME Shell
Window management and application launching
GNOME Shell Extension Preferences
Configure GNOME Shell Extensions
Enable internal tools useful for developers and testers from Alt-F2
Allows access to internal debugging and monitoring tools using the Alt-F2 dialog.
Uuids of extensions to enable
GNOME Shell extensions have a uuid property; this key lists extensions which should be loaded. Any extension that wants to be loaded needs to be in this list. You can also manipulate this list with the EnableExtension and DisableExtension DBus methods on org.gnome.Shell.
Whether to collect stats about applications usage
The shell normally monitors active applications in order to present the most used ones (e.g. in launchers). While this data will be kept private, you may want to disable this for privacy reasons. Please note that doing so won't remove already saved data.
List of desktop file IDs for favorite applications
The applications corresponding to these identifiers will be displayed in the favorites area.

Framerate used for recording screencasts.
The framerate of the resulting screencast recordered by GNOME Shell's screencast recorder in frames-per-second.
The gstreamer pipeline used to encode the screencast
Sets the GStreamer pipeline used to encode recordings. It follows the syntax used for gst-launch. The pipeline should have an unconnected sink pad where the recorded video is recorded. It will normally have a unconnected source pad; output from that pad will be written into the output file. However the pipeline can also take care of its own output - this might be used to send the output to an icecast server via shout2send or similar. When unset or set to an empty value, the default pipeline will be used. This is currently 'vp8enc quality=8 speed=6 threads=%T ! queue ! webmmux' and records to WEBM using the VP8 codec. %T is used as a placeholder for a guess at the optimal thread count on the system.
File extension used for storing the screencast
The filename for recorded screencasts will be a unique filename based on the current date, and use this extension. It should be changed when recording to a different container format.
Select an extension to configure using the combobox above.
