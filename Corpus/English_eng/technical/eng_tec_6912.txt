Using the man ioslave you are able to read the man pages installed on your system. It is easy to use:
man:
See the sections of the manual, click to find the rest.
man: fopen
See the man page of fopen.
man: fopen(3)
See the man page of fopen in section 3.
man: (3)
See the index of section 3.
man: intro (3)
See the introduction of section 3.
If there are more than one man page of the name that you have entered, you will get a list where you can choose the man page that you want to see.
There is also a shortcut: #fopen, which has the same effect as above.
If you do not find all your man pages, adjust the configuration file / etc/ manpath. config (or a file of a similar name depending on your distribution) or adjust the environment variables MANPATH and MANSECT.
As with any other & kde; ioslave, it is possible to enter a & URL;, like man: socket in any & kde; application. Try it in & kwrite; and you will see the man page in & HTML; format.
