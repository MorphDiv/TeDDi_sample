Introduction
& kexi; is a database management application. It can be used for creating databases, inserting data, performing queries, and processing data. Forms can be created to provide a custom interface to your data. All database objects - tables, queries and forms - are stored in the database, making it easy to share data and design.
& kexi; is part of the & koffice; productivity suite for the K Desktop Environment.
In addition to storing your & kexi; databases in files, & kexi; can also store your data on a database server. Using a database server allows you to share your database with other people, and also allows more than one person to use the database at one time. The following database servers are supported by & kexi;:
MySQL (See http: / /www. mysql. com/)
PostgreSQL (See http: / /www. postgresql. org/)
More information about & kexi; can be found at the & kexi; page on the & koffice; website at http: / /www. koffice. org/ kexi/, and on the website for & kexi; itself at http: / /www. kexi-project. org/ about. html.
If you have any questions about & kexi;, there are two mailing lists you can use. The Kexi user mailing list can be used to ask questions about using & kexi; or about the & kexi; project. The Kexi development mailing list can be used to ask questions about the development of & kexi;. Further information on how to subscribe to these lists, together with a few other ways of making contact with & kexi; developers, can be found at:
