Scanning
Do & not scan these directories:
Remove
& Add...
Prevents scanning of filesystems that are not on this computer, e. g. NFS or Samba mounts.
Exclude remote filesystems
Allows scans to enter directories that are part of other filesystems. For example, when unchecked, this will usually prevent the contents of / mnt from being scanned if you scan /.
Scan across filesystem & boundaries
Prevents Filelight from scanning removable media (eg. CD-ROMs).

Color scheme
Contrast
Here you can vary the contrast of the filemap in realtime.
The font size of exploded labels can be varied relative to the depth of the directories they represent. This helps you spot the important labels more easily. Set a sensible minimum font size.
Vary label font sizes
Anti-aliasing the filemap makes it clearer and prettier, unfortunately it also makes rendering very slow.
& Use anti-aliasing
Some files are too small to be rendered on the filemap. Selecting this option makes these files visible by merging them all into a single "multi-segment".
Show small files
The smallest font size Filelight can use to render labels.
