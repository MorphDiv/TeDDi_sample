Konfigurator: & krusader; 's Configuration Center
Configure
Krusader
Konfigurator is & krusader; s configuration center. When running & krusader;, use Settings Configure & krusader;, and it will start Konfigurator. There you can modify the way & krusader; works and customize it to your own needs. At any time, pressing the Apply button applies the changes, pressing Close closes Konfigurator, and pressing Defaults re-applies & krusader; 's "factory" settings. Konfigurator is divided into pages, each containing items related to that page. For some changes to the & GUI;, you have to close and restart & krusader;.
Since & krusader; -1.80.0 the Key-Bindings and Main Toolbar - Actions Toolbar have received their own configuration windows and so they are not a part anymore of Konfigurator, you can configure them now via the Settings menu.
Startup
Startup configuration
Startup configuration
The startup page determines the way that & krusader; looks (and works) when it is launched. It is divided into two main parts:
General
Startup Profile: Starts the selected Panel profile at startup. lt; Last sessiongt; is a special Panel Profile, it is saved automatically when closing & krusader;.
Show splashscreen: Displays a splash screen when starting & krusader;.
Single Instance Mode: Allows only one & krusader; instance to run.
User Interface
Determines which parts of the user interface are visible after start-up.
Save settings on exit: If checked, restores the user interface components to their condition when last shut-down.
Show toolbar: If checked, Main Toolbar is visible after startup.
Show statusbar: If checked, the Statusbar is visible after start-up.
Show function keys: If checked, the FN Keys Bar is visible after start-up.
Show command line: If checked, the Command Line is visible after start-up.
Show terminal emulator: If checked, the Terminal emulator is visible after start-up.
Save last position, size and panel settings: When launched, & krusader; resizes itself to the size it was when last shut-down. & krusader; also appears in the same location on the screen, having panels sorted and aligned as they were. If this option is unchecked, you can use the menu Window Save Position option to manually set & krusader; size and position at start-up.
Start to tray: if checked, & krusader; starts to tray (if minimize to tray is set), without showing the main window.
Look and Feel
Here you can determine the look and feel of things - which means finetuning the application to your needs. The page is divided into four tabs: Operation, Panel, Panel Toolbar and Selection Mode:
Operation
Look & Feel
Warn on exit: If checked, & krusader; displays an "Are you sure?" warning when you try to shut it down; otherwise, it exits without protest.
Minimize to tray: If checked, when you minimize & krusader;, its icon will appear in the system tray instead of the taskbar.
Autoselect Directories: When you select a group of files (either by using Select Group or by using Select All), & krusader; checks this option. If checked, the directories matching the select criteria are also selected. Otherwise, only files are selected.
Rename selects extension: When you rename a file, the whole text is selected. If you want total commanderlike renaming of just the name, without extension, deselect this item.
Use fullpath tab names: If checked, display the full path in the Folder tabs; otherwise only the last part of the path is displayed.
Fullscreen terminal (mc-style): Terminal appears instead of the & krusader; window (full screen).
Quicksearch
New style Quicksearch: The new Quicksearch feature is used.
Case Sensitive Quicksearch: When you use the Quicksearch feature: If checked (the & UNIX; default), all files beginning with capital letters appear before files beginning with lower case letters; otherwise, all files beginning with a specified letter (capital or otherwise) will be displayed together.
Panel
Panel font: Allows you to change the font used inside the file lists.
Filelist icon size: Allows you to change the size of the icons in the file lists. The available sizes are 16x16, 22x22, 32x32 and 48x48 pixels.
Use icons in filenames: If checked, show the icons in file names and folders.
Human readable file size: If checked, the file size appears in kB, Mb & etc;, and not in bytes (default).
To configure the columns use the right click menu in the panel when viewing files. The left and right panel use their own columns independently. The following columns are available:
Name: Shows the filename without the part after the last dot, this latter part is displayed in the Ext column. When the Ext column is made hidden, the complete filename is shown in the Name column like & eg; & konqueror; does.
Ext: Shows the last part of the filename (the part after the last dot) in the ext column, and not as a complete filename in the name column like & eg; & konqueror; does.
Type: Shows the mime type field.
Size: Shows the size field.
Modified: Shows the modified date and time field.
Perms: Shows the full permissions & eg; "rwxr-xr-x" or as octal numbers '0755 'instead with enable/ disable Numeric Permissions in Look & Feel Operation Tab.
rwx: Shows only the rights of the current user & eg; "-rw".
Owner: Shows the owner field.
Group: Shows the group field.
Show Hidden files: If checked, & krusader; displays the "dot-files" which are otherwise hidden.
Numeric permissions: Permission column (Look & Feel Panel tab) shows octal numbers '0755 'instead of'rwxr-xr-x'.
Sort method
Krusader (default): the comparison used so far. Uses comparison using locale rules (even context rules).
Alphabetical: strings are compared character by character (no context rules from locale applied). Alphabet characters are compared using locale rules, special characters are compared by the character code.
Alphabetical with numbers: the same as above, but if the names contains numbers, the numbers are compared numerically instead of alphabetically.
Character code: comparison by character code (quick).
Character code and numbers: the same as above, but with numerical comparison of numbers.
Case Sensitive Sorting: If checked (the & UNIX; default), all files beginning with capital letters appear before files beginning with non-capital letters; otherwise, all files beginning with a specified letter (capital or otherwise) appear together.
Always sort dirs by name: Sorts directories by name, regardless of the sort column.
Uncheck the columns not in use. This allows more space for columns in use.
Panel Toolbar
Panel Toolbar visible: If checked, & krusader; displays the Panel Toolbar.
You can make the buttons on the Panel Toolbar visible or hidden:
Clear Location Toolbar button: Clears the Location Toolbar
Open button
Equal (=) button
Up (..) button
Home (~) button
Root (/) button
Toggle-button for sync-browsing: If checked, shows the Sync-browsing button.
Selection Mode
Here you can configure the selection modes.
krusader; Mode: The way & krusader; has worked from day one. Both mouse keys allow selecting files. To select more than one file, hold the & Ctrl; key and click the & LMB;. Right-click menu appears with a short click on the & RMB;.
Konqueror Mode: pressing the Left Mouse Button selects files -- you can click and select multiple files. Right-click menu appears with a short click on the Right Mouse Button.
Total commander Mode: Pressing the Right Mouse Button selects multiple files and the right-click menu appears with pressing and holding the Right Mouse Button. The Left Mouse Button does not select, but sets the current file without affecting the current selection.
Ergonomic Mode: The Left Mouse Button does not select, but sets the current file without affecting the current selection. The Right Mouse Button invokes the context-menu. You can select with & Ctrl; key and the left button.
Custom Selection Mode: Create your own selection style!
Details
Double-click selects (classic): A single click on a file will select and focus, a double click opens the file or steps into the directory.
Obey KDE global selection policy: Pressing the & LMB; selects files -- Use & kde; 's global setting: & kde; Control Center -gt; Peripherals -gt; Mouse.
Custom Selection Mode items:
Based on & kde; 's selection mode
Left mouse button selects
Left mouse button preserves selection
& Shift; /Ctrl; -Left mouse button selects
Right mouse button selects
Right mouse button preserves selection
& Shift; /Ctrl; -Right mouse button selects
Space bar moves down
Space bar calculates diskspace
Insert moves down
Right-clicking shows the context menu immediately
Colors
This page configures the colors of the List Panel and the Synchronizer. The KDE default colors is the default color configuration.
Use the default KDE colors: this is the default, it uses & kde; color settings of kcontrol.
Use Alternate Background color: If checked, the Background color and the Alternate background color alternates line by line. When you do not use the & kde; default colors, you can configure the alternate colors in the Colors box.
Show current item even if not focused: If checked, shows the last cursor position in the non active list panel. This option is only available when you do not use the & kde; default colors.
Dim the colors of the inactive panel: If checked, the colors of the inactive panel are dimmed. These settings can be configured in the Inactive tab of the Colors box. This option is only available when you do not use the & kde; default colors.
Colors
Configure the colors the way you like, you can see the result in the Preview section. The following items of the active and inactive panel can be configured:
Foreground
Directory foreground
Executable foreground
Symbolic link foreground
Invalid symlink foreground
Background
Alternate background
Selected foreground
Selected background
Alternate selected background
Current foreground
Selected current foreground
Current background
The following items of the Synchronizer can be configured:
Equals foreground
Equals background
Differing foreground
Differing background
Copy to left foreground
Copy to left background
Copy to right foreground
Delete foreground
Delete background
Preview
Here you see a preview of the configured colors.
Color schemes
With the Import Color Scheme and Export Color Scheme buttons you can load and save a Color Scheme profile. This allows & krusader; to use Total Commander, Midnight Commander, foo-commander or your own custom color profile. The Color Schemes are stored in $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ krusader, the foo. color is a binary file that holds the color scheme.
Midnight Commander and Total Commander Color scheme files are provided. Please upload your favorite Color schemes so that they become available for the & krusader; community. Thanks!
General
Here you configure the basic operations.
The following options determine basic aspects of operation:
Delete files/ Move to trash: when & krusader; deletes files it can either'really 'delete them or move them to the trash folder, thereby making them available via & kde; 's trash.
Use mimetype magic: mime type magic is a mechanism which allows & krusader; to inspect the files in the panels and determine their type even if the file has no identifying extension. For example, if you take an image file - 'image1. jpg '- and rename it to'image1', & krusader; will still know it's an image file and work with it accordingly. However, this mode of operation is slower (while refreshing the panel, or changing directories), so try & krusader; with and without mime type magic and decide what is best for you.
Editor: choose what editor will be used when editing a file (via F4). Default the internal viewer is used, this is the & kde; 's default viewer.
Default viewer mode:
Generic mode: use the systems default viewer.
Text mode: view the file in text-only mode.
Hex mode: view the file in hex-only mode.
Lister mode: Fast text/ hex viewer for huge filesizes. Krusader lister never loads the whole file into memory, just a little part of it, and uses caching for faster scrolling. Remote files are downloaded, but during the download, viewing the downloaded part is possible. If a file constantly changes, then it can also be viewed, lister will always see its current state.
Viewer opens each file in a separate window: you can use the browsing tabs for navigation.
Use lister if the text file is bigger than: 10 Mb (default value): checks whether a text file is bigger than 10 MB (configurable), and if yes, then Krusader Lister is used instead of & kde; 's default viewer.
Atomic extensions: predefined atomic extensions like tar. gz are shown as one part in the Ext Column of the List Panel.
Terminal: choose which terminal emulator will be used when & krusader; opens a console window (via F2, or Tools-gt; Start Terminal menu option).
Terminal Emulator sends Chdir on a panel change: if unchecked, there will be no cd command sent to the Terminal Emulator if the panel folder changes.
Temp Directory: this option selects the base directory for & krusader; 's temporary files. The actual files will be created in separate directories under the'Temp directory ', so that each user running & krusader; will have their own temporary subdirectories under the chosen directory.
You must choose a temporary directory to which all users running & krusader; have full permissions!
Advanced
This page handles more advanced issues, so you should double-check your actions here: modifying settings here
makes & krusader; a more powerful AND dangerous tool.
The page is divided into three parts:
Preserve attributes for local copy/ move (slower): If checked, & krusader; will try to preserve all attributes (time, owner, group) of the local files according to the source file depending on your permissions.
Automount filesystems: this makes & krusader; try to mount a file system before entering it. For example, if you click on / mnt/ cdrom (and / mnt/ cdrom appears in / etc/ fstab as a mount point), & krusader; will check if it is mounted. If not, it will try and mount it for you and then enter, so that you would see the contents of your cdrom. Note, however, that & krusader; will NOT unmount when exiting / mnt/ cdrom.
Do not use KDE media protocol for the Media button (if it is buggy or missing): If checked, & krusader; will not use & kde; media protocol for the Media button. Choose this when the media protocol is buggy (in some older & kde; versions) or if you have no kdebase package installed on your system.
MountMan wo n't (un)mount the following mount points: If you have file systems that you do not want to accidentally unmount (or mount) then enter a list of mount points separated by commas (eg; /, / boot, / tmp) and MountMan will not try to (un)mount them.
Confirmations
By checking the options in this section, & krusader; will ask for confirmation before doing a specific action; otherwise, the following actions will be done without warning:
deleting non empty directorie(s)
deleting file(s)
copying file(s)
moving file(s)
Fine-Tuning
Icon Cache Size: & krusader; uses an icon cache, so it will not have to reload icons that have been used before. Of course, as the cache grows bigger, it can store more icons and further speed operations, but the memory footprint of & krusader; will become bigger.
Arguments of updatedb: sets additional arguments for updatedb, please read the manpages for more information.
Archives
This page handles the way & krusader; works with archives. In the General section you will see a list of archive formats. Some are checked and some are grayed-out. The ones that are available (not grayed-out) are supported by & krusader;. If you check them, & krusader; will handle the archives transparently and let you open them as folders; otherwise, & krusader; will attempt to invoke an application which opens archives of that type. If a certain archive is grayed-out, it means that & krusader; could not find the appropriate executables in the configured path. The next archives are supported: ace, arj, bzip2, deb, gzip, iso, lha, rar, rpm, tar, zip and 7-zip.
If you have installed a certain archive application (let's say arj) and want & krusader; to know about it, just click the Auto Configure button. & krusader; will search for all supported executables and print a report listing the archive formats that can be handled. If the operation was successful the new archive should be available and checked.
Please install new packagers to your PATH (i. e.: / usr/ bin or / usr/ local/ bin & etc;)
The full path of the packagers is stored in the Konfigurator Dependencies page (eg; to handle ZIP archives, & krusader; needs the unzip and zip executables). It is possible that you need to manually configure the mimes to the protocols in the Konfigurator Protocol page.
Allow moving into archives: this option allows you to move files into an archive (as opposed to just copying into the archive). The down side is that if a power failure occurs during the process, the files that were moved might already be deleted, but not yet packed into the archive.
If such a thing happens, the file(s) are NOT LOST. They were actually moved into a subfolder in & krusader; 's temp directory. You can search the directory and recover your files.
Test archives when finished packing: this option automatically runs a test on a newly packed archive. It is safer, but takes longer.
Dependencies page
This page configures the full path of the external applications. It is even possible to configure the full path of & krusader;!
General tab
Here you can configure the full path of the following external applications:
application
configurable full path
df
/ bin/ df
eject
/ usr/ bin/ eject
kdesu
/ usr/ bin/ kdesu
kget
/ usr/ bin/ kget
kmail
/ usr/ bin/ kmail
diff utility
/ usr/ bin/ kompare
krename
/ usr/ bin/ krename
krusader
/ usr/ bin/ krusader
locate
/ usr/ bin/ locate
mount
/ bin/ mount
umount
/ bin/ umount
updatedb
/ usr/ bin/ updatedb
By default & kompare; (part of the kdesdk package) is used as external diff utility but you can also use your favorite diff utility & eg; xxdiff or Kdiff3, just fill in the full path and enjoy.
Packers tab
Here you can configure the full path of the following external packers. & krusader; also offers an auto configure tool for packagers.
packer
7z
usr/ bin/ 7z
arj
usr/ bin/ arj
bzip2
usr/ bin/ bzip2
cpio
/ bin/ cpio

unace
/ usr/ bin/ unace
unarj
/ usr/ bin/ unarj
unrar
/ usr/ bin/ unrar
unzip
/ usr/ bin/ unzip
zip
/ usr/ bin/ zip
& krusader; may not be compatible with ACE despite our best efforts. Unace uses closed source and contains additional lines that make Unace get into infinite loop if the stdin is redirected to somewhere else. It works in the same manner as'su ', where you cannot enter the password only from the stdin. & krusader; & gt; = 1-51 emulates the command line environment to enable co-operation with Unace, but we have noticed that Unace always changes its output format from release to release, making co-operation almost impossible.
Checksum Utilities tab
Here you can configure the full path of the following external Checksum Utilities:
Checksum Utilities
supported checksums

UserActions
Here you can configure the terminal for UserActions and the font for the output-collection. The default terminal is konsole --noclose -e. To set up, configure and manage your UserActions use ActionMan (UserActions url).
Protocols
This page links the mimes to protocols. & eg; protocol "tar" is linked to mime "application/ x-tar".
In the Defined Links you will see & eg;
Iso
application/ x-iso
krarc
application/ x-ace
application/ x-arj
application/ x-bzip2
application/ x-cpio
application/ x-deb
application/ x-debian-package
