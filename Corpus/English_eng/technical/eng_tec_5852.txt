Overview
& kiosktool; is a & kde; administration tool that offers system administrators an easy way to predefine desktop configurations for groups of users, lock down settings or otherwise restrict features of the & kde; desktop environment.
& kiosktool; takes advantage of KDE's KIOSK restrictions framework. It is centered around profiles. A profile is a collection of default settings and restrictions that can be applied to either individual users or groups of users.
Typical usage of & kiosktool; is to create a new profile, then to set up the profile with the desired default settings and restrictions, and finally to activate the profile by assigning the profile to one or more users.
When using & kiosktool; in combination with older versions of & kde; (KDE 3.2 or older) some additional steps need to be taken in order to properly activate the profiles.
