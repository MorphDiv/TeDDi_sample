swftext - setspacing() sets the current font spacing to spacing spacing.
Default is 1.0.
0 is all of the letters written at the same point.
This doesn' t really work that well because it inflates the advance across the letter, doesn't add the same amount of spacing between the letters.
I should try and explain that better, prolly.
Or just fix the damn thing to do constant spacing.
This was really just a way to figure out how letter advances work, anyway..
So nyah.
