(no version information, might be only in CVS)
This function tries to open a connection to the printer devicename, and returns a handle on success or FALSE on failure.
If no parameter was given it tries to open a connection to the default printer (if not specified in php.ini as printer.default_printer, php tries to detect it).
printer_open() also starts a device context.
Example 1. printer_open() example
$handle = printer_open( "HP Deskjet 930c"); $handle = printer_open();
