Throughput Performance
Average efficiency of the disk
Spinup Time
Time needed to spin up the disk
Start/Stop Count
Number of spindle start/stop cycles
Reallocated Sector Count
Count of remapped sectors. When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it mark the sector as "reallocated" and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area)
Read Channel Margin
Margin of a channel while reading data.
Seek Error Rate
Frequency of errors while positioning
Seek Timer Performance
