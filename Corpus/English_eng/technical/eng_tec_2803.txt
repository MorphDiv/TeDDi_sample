(PHP 3, PHP 4)
This is the opposite of (boolean) var, except that no warning is generated when the variable is not set.
See converting to boolean for more information.
$var = 0; if (empty($var)) {/ / evaluates true echo '$var is either 0 or not set at all';} if (!isset($var)) {/ / evaluates false echo '$var is not set at all';}
Note that this is meaningless when used on anything which isn' t a variable; i.e. empty (addslashes ($name)) has no meaning since it would be checking whether something which isn't a variable is a variable with a FALSE value.
See also isset() and unset().
