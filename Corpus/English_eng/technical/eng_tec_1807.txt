formula.
The individual operators are shown in the lower section of the Formula Elements window
.
Open the
context menu
in the
Commands
window to see an identical list of the individual functions.
Any operators not found in the Formula Elements window have to be entered directly in the Commands window.
You can also directly insert other parts of the formula even if symbols already exist for them.
Set Operations
icon in the Formula Elements window additional icons will be shown in the lower part of this window.
Simply click a symbol to incorporate the operator in the formula being edited in the Commands window.
The set operations in detail:
Icon
is included in

set operator with two placeholders.
You can also enter
< ? > in < ? >
directly into the Commands window.
Icon
is not included in

set operator with two placeholders.
You can also enter
< ? > notin < ? >
in the Commands window.
Icon
includes

The same happens if you enter
< ? > intersection < ? >
Commands window.
Icon
Union
union
set operator with two placeholders.
You can also enter
< ? > union < ? >
directly in the Commands window.
Icon
Difference
difference
set operator.
You can also enter
< ? > setminus < ? >
or
< ? > bslash < ? >
in the Commands window.
Icon
Quotient set

with two placeholders.
Enter
< ? > slash < ? >
in the Commands window, to achieve the same result.
Icon
aleph
cardinal number
.
You can achieve the same result by entering
aleph
in the Commands window.
Icon
Subset
is a subset of
set operator.
You can also enter
< ? > subset < ? >
directly in the Commands window.
Icon
Subset or equal to
is a subset or equal to
set operator with two placeholders.
You can also enter
< ? > subseteq < ? >
in the Commands window.
Icon
Superset
is a superset of
and two placeholders.
You can also enter
< ? > supset < ? >
in the Commands window.
Icon
Superset or equal to
is a super set or equal to
with two placeholders.
Alternatively, you can enter
< ? > supseteq < ? >
in the Commands window.
Icon
not subset
not subset
set operator with two placeholders.
Instead of this, you can also enter
< ? > nsubset < ? >
.
Icon
not subset or equal to
not subset or equal
set operator with two placeholders.
You can also enter
< ? > nsubseteq < ? >
in the Commands window.
Icon
not superset
not superset
set operator with two placeholders.
You can also enter
< ? > nsupset < ? >
in the Commands window.
Icon
not superset or equal to
not superset or equal
set operator with two placeholders.
Instead of this you can type
< ? > nsupseteq < ? >
in the Commands window.
Icon
Set of natural numbers
set of natural numbers
Instead of this, you can enter
setn
in the Commands window.
Icon
Set of whole numbers
set of whole numbers
You can also do this by entering
setz
in the Commands window.
Icon
Set of rational numbers
set of rational numbers
You can also do this by directly entering
setq
in the Commands window.
Icon
Set of real numbers
set of real numbers
Instead of this, you can enter
setr
in the Commands window.
Icon
Set of complex numbers
set of complex numbers
You can also enter
setc
in the Commands window.
Be sure to leave spaces (gaps) between values and commands when entering them manually in the Commands window.
This ensures that the correct structure is achieved.
