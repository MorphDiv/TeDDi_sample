 apt-cache [options] showsrc pkg1 [pkg2 ...]

apt-cache is a low-level tool used to query information
from APT's binary cache files

Commands:
 gencaches - Build both the package and source cache
 showpkg - Show some general information for a single package
 showsrc - Show source records
 stats - Show some basic statistics
 dump - Show the entire file in a terse form
 dumpavail - Print an available file to stdout
 unmet - Show unmet dependencies
 search - Search the package list for a regex pattern
 show - Show a readable record for the package
 depends - Show raw dependency information for a package
 rdepends - Show reverse dependency information for a package
 pkgnames - List the names of all packages in the system
 dotty - Generate package graphs for GraphViz
 xvcg - Generate package graphs for xvcg
 policy - Show policy settings

Options:
 -h This help text.
 -p=? The package cache.
 -s=? The source cache.
 -q Disable progress indicator.
 -i Show only important deps for the unmet command.
 -c=? Read this configuration file
 -o=? Set an arbitrary configuration option, eg -o dir::cache=/tmp
See the apt-cache(8) and apt.conf(5) manual pages for more information.

Usage: apt-ftparchive [options] command
Commands: packages binarypath [overridefile [pathprefix]]
 sources srcpath [overridefile [pathprefix]]
 contents path
 release path
 generate config [groups]
 clean config

apt-ftparchive generates index files for Debian archives. It supports
many styles of generation from fully automated to functional replacements
for dpkg-scanpackages and dpkg-scansources

apt-ftparchive generates Package files from a tree of .debs. The
Package file contains the contents of all the control fields from
each package as well as the MD5 hash and filesize. An override file
is supported to force the value of Priority and Section.

Similarly apt-ftparchive generates Sources files from a tree of .dscs.
The --source-override option can be used to specify a src override file

The 'packages' and 'sources' command should be run in the root of the
tree. BinaryPath should point to the base of the recursive search and 
override file should contain the override flags. Pathprefix is
appended to the filename fields if present. Example usage from the 
Debian archive:
 apt-ftparchive packages dists/potato/main/binary-i386/ > \\
 dists/potato/main/binary-i386/Packages

Options:
 -h This help text
 --md5 Control MD5 generation
 -s=? Source override file
 -q Quiet
 -d=? Select the optional caching database
 --no-delink Enable delinking debug mode
 --contents Control contents file generation
 -c=? Read this configuration file
 -o=? Set an arbitrary configuration option
