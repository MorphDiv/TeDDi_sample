(PHP 4 = 4.0.2)
Returns:
A string containing the response.
pfpro_process_raw() processes a raw transaction string with Payflow Pro.
You should really use pfpro_process() instead, as the encoding rules of these transactions are non-standard.
The first parameter in this case is a string containing the raw transaction request.
All other parameters are the same as with pfpro_process().
The return value is a string containing the raw response.
Note:
Be sure to read the Payflow Pro Developers Guide for full details of the required parameters and encoding rules.
You would be well advised to use pfpro_process() instead.
Example 1.
Payflow Pro raw example
?php pfpro_init(); $response = pfpro_process_raw("USER=mylogin PWD[5]=m ndy PARTNER=VeriSign TRXTYPE=S TENDER=C AMT=1.50 ACCT=4111111111111111 EXPDATE=0904"); if (!$response) {die("Couldn't establish link to Verisign.\n");} echo "Verisign raw response was ".$response; pfpro_cleanup();?
