Introducing GNOME 3.8
The GNOME community is proud to present GNOME 3.8. This new release features numerous new features as well as a host of smaller enhancements.
3.8 is the result of 6 months of work by the GNOME Project and contains 35936 contributions by approximately 960 people. We think that it is the best version of GNOME to date.
Here are some of the improvements that can be found in the new release.

Improved Animation Rendering
GNOME 3.8 features a significant technological breakthrough in the way that animated graphics are rendered. By improving the coordination between the components responsible for displaying animated graphics, far greater efficiency and performance has been achieved. The result of this work is smooth and robust visual transitions and window resizing. Smoother video playback will also be found under some conditions.
Classic Mode
Classic mode is a new feature for those people who prefer a more traditional desktop experience. Built entirely from GNOME 3 technologies, it adds a number of features such as an application menu, a places menu and a window switcher along the bottom of the screen. Each of these features can be used individually or in combination with other GNOME extensions.
Details
GNOME 3.8 includes a huge number of smaller bug fixes and enhancements. Many details have been addressed to give a more polished experience, including new animated transitions, improved visuals and usability fixes. Many of these improvements were made as a part of the Every Detail Matters initiative, which fixed nearly 60 bugs during the 3.8 development cycle.
Input Methods
Integrated input methods were introduced for the first time in the previous release, GNOME 3.6. They have been the subject of a great deal of work since then, with new features being added as well as bug fixes. These include a new on screen display for input method switching, new candidate character popups, new

Updates to GNOME Applications
GNOME's applications have had a lot of improvements for 3.8. We are also releasing previews of two new applications.


In addition to this major achievement,
WebKit2 includes a new plugins system, which means that Flash is now supported. Plugins are also isolated, improving stability.

The page search interface has been improved, and is now more consistent with other GNOME 3 applications.
Media controls for HTML5 content have been revamped, so that they look better and are easier to use.
An undo close tab action has been added: this is a convenient way to get tabs back that you have accidentally closed.
The toolbar has gained a new tab button.


Automatic USB redirection is now included in all new virtual machines, and can be added to existing ones. This makes it possible to use USB devices (cameras, flash drive, etc) from inside a virtual machine.

Windows XP and Windows 7 express installations have been substantially improved. Copy and paste between the host system and the virtual machine now works out of the box, as does automatic adjustment of the virtual machine's screen resolution. Disk usage has also been made more efficient.
It is now possible to connect to virtual machines running on
There have been many user interface improvements and additions, including the ability to pause multiple virtual machines at the same time, improved multi-selection of virtual machines, additional options in the remote connection assistant, and support for changing the CD-ROM device/ISO from the properties view.

The layout of contact details has been redesigned to make them look better and to make reading easier.
Editing has been vastly improved through a new edit mode. This provides a single place to access the various ways to edit a contact.
A new selection mode provides a convenient way to remove or link multiple contacts.
All your contacts from different online sources are now displayed in the contacts list.
New application previews
Several new applications are being previewed for the first time in GNOME 3.8. These initial releases are intended for testing and feedback.

A new notes application is being developed under the name of Bijiben. It has a simple yet effective design which allows you to group your notes using different colors.

Fully integrated input methods have arrived.
For the very first time, GNOME comes with support for input methods out of the box. It is no longer necessary to manually choose and install an input method framework that may not fit very well into the overall user experience. Input methods are now a part of the core GNOME user experience, just like keyboard layouts.
Feedback Wanted!
Integrated input methods is a major new feature, and changes functionality that is important to many users. We recognize this and want to hear about how you want the new feature to develop in the future.
If you do not wish to make use of this functionality, or prefer to use another framework to provide you with input methods, this remains possible as

Lock Screen
The lock screen is a major new feature for GNOME 3.6. It shows an attractive image on the screen while your computer is locked and also provides useful functionality, such as the display of notifications and the ability to control media playback.
The lock screen means that you can see what is happening while your computer is locked, and it allows you to get a summary of what has been happening while you have been away. (This functionality can be disabled via the
The login screen has also been updated for GNOME 3.6, and has a new visual style and other minor enhancemets. Combined with the new lock screen, the result is a smoother experience when you log in or unlock your computer.

Major updates make it better looking and easier to use.
The message tray has received some major updates for GNOME 3.6. Many of these changes were based on feedback and testing, which indicated some interaction issues with the old tray design.
The new tray is clearer, better looking, and easier to interact with. It refines the existing design so that it is less error-prone and more satisfying to use. Instead of overlapping the viewing area, the new tray slides the view up, revealing the tray below. The items in the tray are also bigger, clearer, and don't move around, making them easier to use.
The way that the tray is triggered has also been altered. The hot corner – which many people had problems with – has been replaced. Instead, the whole of the bottom screen edge now acts as a trigger area; letting the mouse rest there for a short period will cause the tray to appear. We plan to improve this behavior in subsequent releases.
For the first time, the message tray is also accessible with the keyboard. Press
Smarter, more noticeable, easier to dismiss.
GNOME's notification pop-ups have had quite a few refinements for 3.6. For the new release, we have made them:
Smarter: notifications are smarter in GNOME 3.6. If you are running a full screen application or game, we only show you your important notifications. All other notifications are delayed until you stop using your full screen application.
More noticeable: we have tweaked the behavior of notification pop-ups to make sure that you see all your notifications. No longer will you miss out on a notification as we only hide a notification after we know you have interacted with the system.
Easier to dismiss: notification bubbles now feature close buttons. This makes it much clearer how to dismiss a notification.
Better looking main interface, many settings have also been improved and extended.
GNOME 3.6 comes with lots of changes to
The main
Background
We looked at how someone would select a background in 3.4, and noticed a number of issues. It was quite easy to accidentally change the current background, while selecting a new background was quite difficult.
In 3.6, we show the current background as a large thumbnail. When clicked, you can easily select either a background, one of your pictures or a background color. To make your choice easier, we have made the previews bigger.
We have also refreshed the default background in 3.6, and have updated the choice of alternative backgrounds to include new images. Setting a single color as a background has also been improved and features a new set of colors.

User Accounts
A major new feature in GNOME 3.6 is the addition of Enterprise logins (also called Active Directory or Kerberos logins). This allows GNOME to be used in centrally managed and corporate environments in a much more integrated manner. Users can enroll their computer with an enterprise network, and use their enterprise user name and password to log into GNOME.
Network
The network settings panel has been improved to make it easier to select wireless connections. A new list now gives access to all available and remembered wireless networks. You can inspect and forget access points, regardless whether they are currently in range or not.

The Overview
The most noticeable difference in 3.6 is the first version of 'The Overview'. While this is still an evolving design, it already is a solid improvement to the user experience.
The previously blank start page was replaced by a grid that holds your most visited pages. Your favorite pages are now easier to access, especially on touch devices, and valuable screen real estate is used! And if an unwanted page ends up there, you can remove it from the grid by clicking on the

No more worries to activate accessibility!
Accessibility Always On
So far, users that needed any assistive technology had to activate accessibility support. This was cumbersome, because they had to figure out how to do that without the help of any assistive technology that they may need.
Starting with GNOME 3.6, the accessibility stack has been highly integrated into the core, so users that need any assistive technology can use GNOME right from the start.
This feature is an important milestone in GNOME's mission to deliver a free and open desktop to everyone. More than ever, it can be stated that GNOME accessibility is built-in and not bolted-on.
To summarize:
Built-in and always ready accessibility support.
Users don't notice any difference unless they use any Assistive Technology.

GNOME 3.6 brings inverse video, brightness, contrast, and grayscale options to the GNOME magnifier. The combination of these options is very powerful and is particularly useful for people with low-vision, any degree of photophobia, or just for using the computer under adverse lighting conditions.
