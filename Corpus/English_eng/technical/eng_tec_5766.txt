The goal of the game is to put 5 balls of the same color in line.
You can make horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines.
Each turn, three new balls are placed on the board.
Every turn, you can move one ball.
To move a ball, click on it with the mouse, then click where you want the ball to go.
You just moved the blue ball!
Balls can be moved to every position on the board, as long as there are no other balls in their way.
Now we only need one more blue ball.
It seems to be our lucky day!
Now you try! Click on the green ball and move it to the others!
Almost, try again!
Very good!
Whenever you complete a line you get an extra turn.
This is the end of this tutorial. Feel free to finish the game!
