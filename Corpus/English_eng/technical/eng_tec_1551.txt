Custom Animation Pane
Assigns effects to selected objects.
Animation List
The animation list displays all animations for the current slide.
Each slide has one main animation that runs when the slide is shown.
More animations may be present, which run when a shape is shown.
If any of these animated shapes are present, they are listed in the lower half of the animation list.
Tabs display the name of each shape that runs an animation.
Each list entry can consist of the following columns, from left to right:
An optional + character signals that the text paragraphs are animated.
The second column shows the execution number of the animation.
Column three shows a mouse icon if the animation is started by a mouse-click, and a clock if the animation starts after the previous animation ends.
In column four, an icon shows the animation effect.
The fifth column shows the name of the shape for this animation effect and optionally the first characters of animated text.
