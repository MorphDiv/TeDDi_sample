Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
ingres_fetch_row() returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
Each result column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 1.
Subsequent call to ingres_fetch_row() would return the next row in the result set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
Example 1. ingres_fetch_row() example
?php ingres_connect ($database, $user, $password); ingres_query ("select * from table"); while ($row = ingres_fetch_row()) {echo $row[1]; echo $row[2];}?
See also ingres_num_fields(), ingres_query(), ingres_fetch_array(), and ingres_fetch_object().
