Data URLs

ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Data URLs allow small document data to be included in the URL itself. This is useful for very small HTML testcases or other occasions that do not justify a document of their own.
data: ,foobar (note the comma after the colon) will deliver a text document that contains nothing but foobar
The last example delivered a text document. For HTML documents one has to specify the MIME type text/ html: data: text/ html, lt; titlegt; Testcaselt; /titlegt; lt; pgt; This is a testcaselt; /pgt;. This will produce exactly the same output as if the content had been loaded from a document of its own.
Specifying alternate character sets is also possible. Note that 8-Bit characters have to be escaped by a percentage sign and their two-digit hexadecimal codes: data:; charset=iso-8859-1, Gr%FC%DFe aus Schl%E4gl results in Gruuml; szlig; e aus Schlauml; gl whereas omitting the charset attribute might lead to something like Gr? ?e aus Schl? gl
