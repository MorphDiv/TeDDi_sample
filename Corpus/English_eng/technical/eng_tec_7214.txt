If your photos or videos are too dark or the colors seem to be wrong, try adjusting their saturation, contrast, brightness and hue:
Under
Click
Different options under
Brightness
Increasing the brightness will make the photos and videos lighter. However, if you are in a dark room, increasing the brightness might make the image look more noisy.
Contrast
Setting a higher contrast will increase the difference between darker and lighter colors. If the image looks washed out, try increasing the contrast.
Hue
Changing the hue of the image will add a tint to it. If image seems to be the wrong color (for example, too yellow), try changing the hue.
Saturation
Reducing the saturation makes the image less colorful. If colors seem too harsh, reduce the saturation.
The resolution of a video or photo determines how much detail you can see in it, changing it will affect the file size.
Change the capture resolution of your webcam
Higher resolution generally means better quality images, but photos and videos with higher resolution take up more space on your hard disk. High resolution videos, in particular, take up a lot of space.
If you want your images to take up less disk space, reduce the resolution of your webcam. If you want better quality images, increase the resolution. To change the webcam resolution:
Choose a different resolution from the drop-down list. Some webcams only support one resolution, so you may not have a choice.
