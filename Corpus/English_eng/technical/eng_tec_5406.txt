In order to use the SNMP functions on Unix you need to install the UCD SNMP package.
On Windows these functions are only available on NT and not on Win95 / 98.
Important:
In order to use the UCD SNMP package, you need to define NO_ZEROLENGTH_COMMUNITY to 1 before compiling it.
After configuring UCD SNMP, edit config.h and search for NO_ZEROLENGTH_COMMUNITY.
Uncomment the #define line.
It should look like this afterwards:
#define NO_ZEROLENGTH_COMMUNITY 1
If you see strange segmentation faults in combination with SNMP commands, you did not follow the above instructions.
If you do not want to recompile UCD SNMP, you can compile PHP with the --enable-ucd-snmp-hack switch which will work around the misfeature.

This directory should be moved to DRIVE:\usr\mibs, where DRIVE must be replaced with the driveletter where PHP is installed on, e.g.: c:\usr\mibs.
This extension has no configuration directives defined in php.ini.
