4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of major depressive episodes.
Treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults.
Treatment of generalised anxiety disorder.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
For oral use.
Adults Major Depressive Episodes:
The starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg once daily with or without food.
Dosages above 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, have been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.
However, there is no clinical evidence suggesting that patients not responding to the initial recommended dose may benefit from dose up-titrations.
Therapeutic response is usually seen after 2-4 weeks of treatment.
After consolidation of the antidepressive response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several months, in order to avoid relapse.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder:
The recommended starting dose in patients with Generalised Anxiety Disorder is 30 mg once daily with or without food.
In patients with insufficient response the dose should be increased to 60 mg, which is the usual maintenance dose in most patients.
In patients with co-morbid Major Depressive Episodes, the starting and maintenance dose is 60 mg once daily (please see also dosing recommendation above).
Doses up to 120 mg per day have been shown to be efficacious and have been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.
In patients with insufficient response to 60 mg, escalation up to 90 mg or 120 mg may therefore be considered.
Dose escalation should be based upon clinical response and tolerability.
After consolidation of the response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several months, in order to avoid relapse.
2 Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain:
The starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg daily with or without food.
Dosages above 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, have been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.
The plasma concentration of duloxetine displays large inter-individual variability (see 5.2).
Hence, some patients that respond insufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose.
The medicinal product response should be evaluated after 2 months’ of treatment.
Additional response after this time is unlikely (see 5.1).
The therapeutic benefit should regularly (at least every three months) be reassessed.
Elderly Major Depressive Episodes:
No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age.
However, as with any medicine, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly, especially with XERISTAR 120 mg per day for which data are limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Other Indications:
No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age.
However, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see section 5.2).
Children and adolescents The safety and efficacy of duloxetine in these age groups have not been studied.
Therefore, administration of XERISTAR to children and adolescents is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment XERISTAR should not be used in patients with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).
Renal insufficiency No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/ min).
See section 4.3 for severe renal impairment.
Discontinuation of treatment Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.
When stopping treatment with XERISTAR the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered.
Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Concomitant use of XERISTAR with nonselective, irreversible Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) is contraindicated (see section 4.5).
Liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
XERISTAR should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin or enoxacine (i. e. potent CYP1A2 inhibitors) since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of duloxetine (see section 4.5).
Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min) (see section 4.4).
The initiation of treatment with XERISTAR is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive crisis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
3 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Mania and seizures XERISTAR should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and/ or seizures.
Mydriasis Mydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when prescribing XERISTAR to patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-angle glaucoma.
Blood pressure and heart rate Duloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant hypertension in some patients.
This may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine.
Cases of hypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing hypertension.
Therefore, in patients with known hypertension and/ or other cardiac disease, blood pressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment.
Duloxetine should be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart rate or by an increase in blood pressure.
Caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used with medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5).
For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8).
In patients with uncontrolled hypertension duloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3).
Renal impairment Increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on haemodialysis (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min).
For patients with severe renal impairment, see section 4.3.
See section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction.
Use with antidepressants Caution should be exercised when using XERISTAR in combination with antidepressants.
In particular the combination with selective reversible MAOIs is not recommended.
St John’ s wort Undesirable effects may be more common during concomitant use of XERISTAR and herbal preparations containing St John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum).
Suicide Major Depressive Episodes and Generalised Anxiety Disorder Depression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide- related events).
This risk persists until significant remission occurs.
As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs.
It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery.
Other psychiatric conditions for which XERISTAR is prescribed can also be associated with an increased risk of suicide-related events.
In addition, these conditions may be co-morbid with major depressive disorder.
The same precautions observed when treating patients with major depressive disorder should therefore be observed when treating patients with other psychiatric disorders.
Patients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal thoughts prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment.
A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 years old.
Cases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8).
4 Close supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany drug therapy especially in early treatment and following dose changes.
Patients, (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted about the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain As with other medicinal products with similar pharmacological action (antidepressants), isolated cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation.
Concerning risk factors for suicidality in depression, see above.
Physicians should encourage patients to report any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time.
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age No clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations.
XERISTAR should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
Suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo.
If, based on clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be carefully monitored for the appearance of suicidal symptoms.
In addition, long-term safety data in children and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development are lacking.
Haemorrhage There have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal haemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/ norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/ or medicinal products known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding tendencies.
Hyponatremia Hyponatremia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, when administering XERISTAR.
Caution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatremia; such as elderly, cirrhotic, or dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics.
Hyponatremia may be due to a syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).
Discontinuation of treatment Withdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is abrupt (see section 4.8).
In clinical trials adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation occurred in approximately 45% of patients treated with XERISTAR and 23% of patients taking placebo.
The risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with SSRI’ s and SNRI’ s may be dependent on several factors including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction.
The most commonly reported reactions are listed in section 4.8.
Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, in some patients they may be severe in intensity.
They usually occur within the first few days of discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have inadvertently missed a dose.
Generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more).
It is therefore advised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no less than 2 weeks, according to the patient’ s needs (see section 4.2).
Elderly Major Depressive Episodes:
Data on the use of XERISTAR 120mg in elderly patients with major depressive disorders are limited.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly with the maximum dosage (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Generalised Anxiety Disorder:
Data on the use of XERISTAR in elderly patients with generalised anxiety disorder are limited.
5 Akathisia/ psychomotor restlessness The use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a subjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability to sit or stand still.
This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment.
In patients who develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental.
Medicinal products containing duloxetine Duloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, major depressive episodes, generalised anxiety disorder as well as stress urinary incontinence).
The use of more than one of these products concomitantly should be avoided.
Hepatitis/ increased liver enzymes Cases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (> 10 times upper limit of normal), hepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8).
Most of them occurred during the first months of treatment.
The pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular.
Duloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated with hepatic injury.
Sucrose XERISTAR hard gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
CNS medicinal products: the risk of using duloxetine in combination with other CNS-active medicinal products has not been systematically evaluated, except in the cases described in this section.
Consequently, caution is advised when XERISTAR is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and substances including alcohol and sedative medicinal products (e. g. benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, XERISTAR should not be used in combination with nonselective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI.
Based on the half-life of duloxetine, at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping XERISTAR before starting an MAOI (see section 4.3).
For selective, reversible MAOIs, like moclobemide, the risk of serotonin syndrome is lower.
However, the concomitant use of XERISTAR with selective, reversible MAOIs is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Serotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using SSRIs (e. g. paroxetine, fluoxetine) concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products.
Caution is advisable if XERISTAR is used concomitantly with serotonergic antidepressants like SSRIs, tricyclics like clomipramine or amitriptyline, St John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum), venlafaxine or triptans, tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan.
Effect of duloxetine on other medicinal products Medicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2:
The pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a CYP1A2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6:
Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6.
When duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold.
The co-administration of duloxetine (40 mg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71%, but does not affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is recommended.
Caution is advised if XERISTAR is co-administered with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] such as 6 nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol).
Oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A.
Specific in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed.
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents:
Caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding.
Furthermore, increases in INR values have been reported when duloxetine was co-administered with warfarin.
Effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine Antacids and H2 antagonists: co-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium- containing antacids or duloxetine with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.
Inhibitors of CYP 1A2: because CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of duloxetine with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine.
Fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased AUCo-t 6-fold.
Therefore XERISTAR should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 like fluvoxamine (see section 4.3).
Inducers of CYP1A2:
Population pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% lower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (AUC) of duloxetine lower than the maximum clinical exposure (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
As with other serotoninergic medicinal products, discontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term.
XERISTAR should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant, or intend to become pregnant, during therapy.
Breast feeding Duloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did not breast feed their children.
The estimated daily infant dose on a mg/ kg basis is approximately 0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2).
As the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the use of XERISTAR while breast-feeding is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
XERISTAR may be associated with sedation and dizziness.
Patients should be instructed that if they experience sedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Table 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled clinical trials (comprising a total of 8239 patients, 5075 on duloxetine and 3164 on placebo) in depression, generalized anxiety disorder and diabetic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.
7 The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with XERISTAR were nausea, headache, dry mouth, somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness and constipation.
However, the majority of common adverse reactions were mild to moderate, they usually started early in therapy, and most tended to subside even as therapy was continued.

Cases of tinnitus have also been reported after treatment discontinuation.
2 Cases of orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported especially at the initiation of treatment.
3 See section 4.4 4 Cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment of after treatment discontinuation.
5 Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4)
Discontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms.
Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), fatigue, agitation or anxiety, nausea and/ or vomiting, tremor, headache, irritability, diarrhoea, hyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions.
Generally, for SSRIs and SNRIs, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in some patients they may be severe and/ or prolonged.
It is therefore advised that when duloxetine treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see
10 sections 4.2 and 4.4).
In the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine- treated patients.
HbA1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients.
In the extension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in HbA1c in both the duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine- treated group.
There was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in duloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care group.
The heart rate-corrected QT interval in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in placebo-treated patients.
No clinically significant differences were observed for QT, PR, QRS, or QTcB measurements between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients.
4.9 Overdose
Cases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other drugs, with duloxetine doses of 4800mg were reported.
Some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with duloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg.
Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine alone or with mixed drugs) included somnolence, coma, serotonin syndrome, seizures,, vomiting andtachycardia.
No specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment (such as with cyproheptadine and/ or temperature control) may be considered.
A free airway should be established.
Monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate symptomatic and supportive measures.
Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients.
Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption.
Duloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange perfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Other antidepressants.
ATC code:
N06AX21.
Duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor.
It weakly inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic and adrenergic receptors.
Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in various brain areas of animals.
Duloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain.
The pain inhibitory action of duloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the central nervous system.
Major Depressive Episodes:
XERISTAR was studied in a clinical programme involving 3,158 patients (1,285 patient-years of exposure) meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression.
The efficacy of XERISTAR at the recommended dose of 60 mg once a day was demonstrated in three out of three randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose acute studies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder.
Overall, XERISTAR’ s efficacy has been demonstrated at daily doses between 60 and 120 mg in a total of five out of seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose acute studies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder.
XERISTAR demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the 17- 11 item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score (including both the emotional and somatic symptoms of depression).
Response and remission rates were also statistically significantly higher with XERISTAR compared with placebo.
Only a small proportion of patients included in pivotal clinical trials had severe depression (baseline HAM-D > 25).
In a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 12-weeks of acute treatment with open-label XERISTAR 60 mg once daily were randomised to either XERISTAR 60 mg once daily or placebo for a further 6-months.
XERISTAR 60 mg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant superiority compared to placebo (p=0.004) on the primary outcome measure, the prevention of depressive relapse, as measured by time to relapse.
The incidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow-up period was 17% and 29% for duloxetine and placebo, respectively.
The effect of XERISTAR 60 mg once a day in elderly depressed patients (≥ 65 years) was specifically examined in a study that showed a statistically significative difference in the reduction of the HAMD17 score for duloxetine-treated patients compared to placebo.
Tolerability of XERISTAR 60 mg once day in elderly patients was comparable to that seen in the younger adults.
However, data on elderly patients exposed to the maximum dose (120mg per day) are limited and thus, caution is recommended when treating this population.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder XERISTAR demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo in five out of five studies including four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled acute studies and a relapse prevention study in adult patients with generalised anxiety disorder.
XERISTAR demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score.
Response and remission rates were also higher with XERISTAR compared to placebo.
XERISTAR showed comparable efficacy results to venlafaxine in terms of improvements on the HAM-A total score.
In a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 6 months of acute treatment with open-label XERISTAR were randomised to either XERISTAR or placebo for further 6-months.
XERISTAR 60 mg to 120 mg once daily demonstrated statistically significant superiority compared to placebo (p < 0.001) on the prevention of relapse, as measured by time to relapse.
The incidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow-up period was 14% for XERISTAR and 42% for placebo.
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain:
The efficacy of XERISTAR as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 randomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) having diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months.
Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder were excluded from these trials.
The primary outcome measure was the weekly mean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point Likert scale.
In both studies, XERISTAR 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain compared with placebo.
The effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment.
The difference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.
At least 30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus 40% for placebo.
The corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% respectively.
Clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to whether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment.
For patients not experiencing somnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients on placebo.
Clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on duloxetine and 30% on placebo.
Patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were unlikely to reach this level during further treatment.
12 Although data from a one-year open label study offer some evidence for longer-term efficacy, no conclusive efficacy data for treatments longer than 12 weeks duration are available from placebo- controlled studies.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer.
Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation.
The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, smoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status.
Duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post dose.
The absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%).
Food delays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (approximately 11%).
These changes do not have any clinical significance.
Duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins.
Duloxetine binds to both albumin and alpha-l acid glycoprotein.
Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.
Duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine.
Both cytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide conjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5hydroxy,6-methoxy duloxetine.
Based upon in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive.
The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2D6 has not been specifically investigated.
Limited data suggest that the plasma levels of duloxetine are higher in these patients.
The elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours).
After an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/ hr to 46 l/ hr (mean of 36 l/ hr).
After an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/ hr (mean 101 l/ hr).
Special populations:
Gender: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent plasma clearance is approximately 50% lower in females).
Based upon the overlap in the range of clearance, gender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a lower dose for female patients.
Age: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥ 65 years) (AUC increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the magnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose.
As a general recommendation, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Renal impairment: end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher duloxetine Cmax and AUC values compared with healthy subjects.
Pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment: moderate liver disease (Child Pugh Class B) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine.
Compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% lower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the AUC was 3.7 times higher in patients with moderate liver disease.
The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not been studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency.
Nursing mothers:
The disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks postpartum.
Duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in breast milk are about one-fourth those in plasma.
The amount of duloxetine in breast milk is approximately 7 µg/ day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing.
Lactation did not influence duloxetine pharmacokinetics.
13 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Duloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.
Multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat carcinogenicity study.
The underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.
Female mice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/ kg/ day), but these were considered to be secondary to hepatic microsomal enzyme induction.
The relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown.
Female rats receiving duloxetine (45 mg/ kg/ day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC).
In an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels below the maximum clinical exposure (AUC).
No malformations were observed in another study testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine.
In prenatal/ postnatal toxicity studies in the rat, duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at exposures below maximum clinical exposure (AUC).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of major depressive episodes.
Treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults.
Treatment of generalised anxiety disorder.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
For oral use.
Adults Major Depressive Episodes:
The starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg once daily with or without food.
Dosages above 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, have been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.
However, there is no clinical evidence suggesting that patients not responding to the initial recommended dose may benefit from dose up-titrations.
Therapeutic response is usually seen after 2-4 weeks of treatment.
After consolidation of the antidepressive response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several months, in order to avoid relapse.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder:
The recommended starting dose in patients with Generalised Anxiety Disorder is 30 mg once daily with or without food.
In patients with insufficient response the dose should be increased to 60 mg, which is the usual maintenance dose in most patients.
In patients with co-morbid Major Depressive Episodes, the starting and maintenance dose is 60 mg once daily (please see also dosing recommendation above).
Doses up to 120 mg per day have been shown to be efficacious and have been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.
In patients with insufficient response to 60 mg, escalation up to 90 mg or 120 mg may therefore be considered.
Dose escalation should be based upon clinical response and tolerability.
After consolidation of the response, it is recommended to continue treatment for several months, in order to avoid relapse.
16 Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain:
The starting and recommended maintenance dose is 60 mg daily with or without food.
Dosages above 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in evenly divided doses, have been evaluated from a safety perspective in clinical trials.
The plasma concentration of duloxetine displays large inter-individual variability (see 5.2).
Hence, some patients that respond insufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose.
The medicinal product response should be evaluated after 2 months’ of treatment.
Additional response after this time is unlikely (see 5.1).
The therapeutic benefit should regularly (at least every three months) be reassessed.
Elderly Major Depressive Episodes:
No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age.
However, as with any medicine, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly, especially with XERISTAR 120 mg per day for which data are limited (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Other Indications:
No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients solely on the basis of age.
However, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see section 5.2).
Children and adolescents The safety and efficacy of duloxetine in these age groups have not been studied.
Therefore, administration of XERISTAR to children and adolescents is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment XERISTAR should not be used in patients with liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).
Renal insufficiency No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 ml/ min).
See section 4.3 for severe renal impairment.
Discontinuation of treatment Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.
When stopping treatment with XERISTAR the dose should be gradually reduced over a period of at least one to two weeks in order to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered.
Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Concomitant use of XERISTAR with nonselective, irreversible Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) is contraindicated (see section 4.5).
Liver disease resulting in hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
XERISTAR should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin or enoxacine (i. e. potent CYP1A2 inhibitors) since the combination results in elevated plasma concentrations of duloxetine (see section 4.5).
Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min) (see section 4.4).
The initiation of treatment with XERISTAR is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension that could expose patients to a potential risk of hypertensive crisis (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
17 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Mania and seizures XERISTAR should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and/ or seizures.
Mydriasis Mydriasis has been reported in association with duloxetine, therefore, caution should be used when prescribing XERISTAR to patients with increased intraocular pressure, or those at risk of acute narrow-angle glaucoma.
Blood pressure and heart rate Duloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant hypertension in some patients.
This may be due to the noradrenergic effect of duloxetine.
Cases of hypertensive crisis have been reported with duloxetine, especially in patients with pre-existing hypertension.
Therefore, in patients with known hypertension and/ or other cardiac disease, blood pressure monitoring is recommended, especially during the first month of treatment.
Duloxetine should be used with caution in patients whose conditions could be compromised by an increased heart rate or by an increase in blood pressure.
Caution should also be exercised when duloxetine is used with medicinal products that may impair its metabolism (see section 4.5).
For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving duloxetine either dose reduction or gradual discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8).
In patients with uncontrolled hypertension duloxetine should not be initiated (see section 4.3).
Renal impairment Increased plasma concentrations of duloxetine occur in patients with severe renal impairment on haemodialysis (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min).
For patients with severe renal impairment, see section 4.3.
See section 4.2 for information on patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction.
Use with antidepressants Caution should be exercised when using XERISTAR in combination with antidepressants.
In particular the combination with selective reversible MAOIs is not recommended.
St John’ s wort Undesirable effects may be more common during concomitant use of XERISTAR and herbal preparations containing St John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum).
Suicide Major Depressive Episodes and Generalised Anxiety Disorder Depression is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide (suicide- related events).
This risk persists until significant remission occurs.
As improvement may not occur during the first few weeks or more of treatment, patients should be closely monitored until such improvement occurs.
It is general clinical experience that the risk of suicide may increase in the early stages of recovery.
Other psychiatric conditions for which XERISTAR is prescribed can also be associated with an increased risk of suicide-related events.
In addition, these conditions may be co-morbid with major depressive disorder.
The same precautions observed when treating patients with major depressive disorder should therefore be observed when treating patients with other psychiatric disorders.
Patients with a history of suicide-related events or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal thoughts prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behaviour, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment.
A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant medicinal products in psychiatric disorders showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 years old.
Cases of suicidal thoughts and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.8).
18 Close supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany medicinal product therapy especially in early treatment and following dose changes.
Patients, (and caregivers of patients) should be alerted about the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain As with other medicinal products with similar pharmacological action (antidepressants), isolated cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation.
Concerning risk factors for suicidality in depression, see above.
Physicians should encourage patients to report any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time.
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age No clinical trials have been conducted with duloxetine in paediatric populations.
XERISTAR should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years.
Suicide-related behaviours (suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts), and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger), were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children and adolescents treated with antidepressants compared to those treated with placebo.
If, based on clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, the patient should be carefully monitored for the appearance of suicidal symptoms.
In addition, long-term safety data in children and adolescents concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development are lacking.
Haemorrhage There have been reports of bleeding abnormalities, such as ecchymoses, purpura and gastrointestinal haemorrhage with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/ norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
Caution is advised in patients taking anticoagulants and/ or medicinal products known to affect platelet function, and in patients with known bleeding tendencies.
Hyponatremia Hyponatremia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly, when administering XERISTAR.
Caution is required in patients at increased risk for hyponatremia; such as elderly, cirrhotic, or dehydrated patients or patients treated with diuretics.
Hyponatremia may be due to a syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).
Discontinuation of treatment Withdrawal symptoms when treatment is discontinued are common, particularly if discontinuation is abrupt (see section 4.8).
In clinical trials adverse events seen on abrupt treatment discontinuation occurred in approximately 45% of patients treated with XERISTAR and 23% of patients taking placebo.
The risk of withdrawal symptoms seen with SSRI’ s and SNRI’ s may be dependent on several factors including the duration and dose of therapy and the rate of dose reduction.
The most commonly reported reactions are listed in section 4.8.
Generally these symptoms are mild to moderate, however, in some patients they may be severe in intensity.
They usually occur within the first few days of discontinuing treatment, but there have been very rare reports of such symptoms in patients who have inadvertently missed a dose.
Generally these symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve within 2 weeks, though in some individuals they may be prolonged (2-3 months or more).
It is therefore advised that duloxetine should be gradually tapered when discontinuing treatment over a period of no less than 2 weeks, according to the patient’ s needs (see section 4.2).
Elderly Major Depressive Episodes:
Data on the use of XERISTAR 120mg in elderly patients with major depressive disorders are limited..
Therefore, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly with the maximum dosage (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).
Generalised Anxiety Disorder:
Data on the use of XERISTAR in elderly patients with generalised anxiety disorder are limited.
19 Akathisia/ psychomotor restlessness The use of duloxetine has been associated with the development of akathisia, characterised by a subjectively unpleasant or distressing restlessness and need to move often accompanied by an inability to sit or stand still.
This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment.
In patients who develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental.
Medicinal products containing duloxetine Duloxetine is used under different trademarks in several indications (treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, major depressive episodes as well as stress urinary incontinence).
The use of more than one of these products concomitantly should be avoided.
Hepatitis/ increased liver enzymes Cases of liver injury, including severe elevations of liver enzymes (> 10 times upper limit of normal), hepatitis and jaundice have been reported with duloxetine (see section 4.8).
Most of them occurred during the first months of treatment.
The pattern of liver damage was predominantly hepatocellular.
Duloxetine should be used with caution in patients treated with other medicinal products associated with hepatic injury.
Sucrose XERISTAR hard gastro-resistant capsules contain sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
CNS medicinal products: the risk of using duloxetine in combination with other CNS-active medicinal products has not been systematically evaluated, except in the cases described in this section.
Consequently, caution is advised when XERISTAR is taken in combination with other centrally acting medicinal products and substances including alcohol and sedative medicinal products (e. g. benzodiazepines, morphinomimetics, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, sedative antihistamines).
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, XERISTAR should not be used in combination with nonselective irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within at least 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI.
Based on the half-life of duloxetine, at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping XERISTAR before starting an MAOI (see section 4.3).
For selective, reversible MAOIs, like moclobemide, the risk of serotonin syndrome is lower.
However, the concomitant use of XERISTAR with selective, reversible MAOIs is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Serotonin syndrome: in rare cases, serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients using SSRIs (e. g. paroxetine, fluoxetine) concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products.
Caution is advisable if XERISTAR is used concomitantly with serotonergic antidepressants like SSRIs, tricyclics like clomipramine or amitriptyline, St John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum), venlafaxine or triptans, tramadol, pethidine and tryptophan.
Effect of duloxetine on other medicinal products Medicinal products metabolised by CYP1A2:
The pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a CYP1A2 substrate, were not significantly affected by co-administration with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2D6:
Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6.
When duloxetine was administered at a dose of 60 mg twice daily with a single dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold.
The co-administration of duloxetine (40 mg twice daily) increases steady state AUC of tolterodine (2 mg twice daily) by 71%, but does not affect the pharmacokinetics of its active 5-hydroxyl metabolite and no dosage adjustment is recommended.
Caution is advised if XERISTAR is co-administered with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by CYP2D6 (risperidone, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] such as 20 nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine) particularly if they have a narrow therapeutic index (such as flecainide, propafenone and metoprolol).
Oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents: results of in vitro studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce the catalytic activity of CYP3A.
Specific in vivo drug interaction studies have not been performed.
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents:
Caution should be exercised when duloxetine is combined with oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents due to a potential increased risk of bleeding.
Furthermore, increases in INR values have been reported when duloxetine was co-administered with warfarin.
Effects of other medicinal products on duloxetine Antacids and H2 antagonists: co-administration of duloxetine with aluminium- and magnesium- containing antacids or duloxetine with famotidine had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose.
Inhibitors of CYP 1A2: because CYP1A2 is involved in duloxetine metabolism, concomitant use of duloxetine with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 is likely to result in higher concentrations of duloxetine.
Fluvoxamine (100 mg once daily), a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, decreased the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine by about 77% and increased AUCo-t 6-fold.
Therefore XERISTAR should not be administered in combination with potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 like fluvoxamine (see section 4.3).
Inducers of CYP1A2:
Population pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that smokers have almost 50% lower plasma concentrations of duloxetine compared with non-smokers.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data on the use of duloxetine in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at systemic exposure levels (AUC) of duloxetine lower than the maximum clinical exposure (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
As with other serotoninergic medicinal products, discontinuation symptoms may occur in the neonate after maternal duloxetine use near term.
XERISTAR should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Women should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant, or intend to become pregnant, during therapy.
Breast feeding Duloxetine is very weakly excreted into human milk based on a study of 6 lactating patients, who did not breast feed their children.
The estimated daily infant dose on a mg/ kg basis is approximately 0.14% of the maternal dose (see section 5.2).
As the safety of duloxetine in infants is not known, the use of XERISTAR while breast-feeding is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
XERISTAR may be associated with sedation and dizziness.
Patients should be instructed that if they experience sedation or dizziness they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Table 1 gives the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo-controlled clinical trials (comprising a total of 8239 patients, 5075 on duloxetine and 3164 on placebo) in depression, generalized anxiety disorder and diabetic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.
21 The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with XERISTAR were nausea, headache, dry mouth, somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness and constipation.
However, the majority of common adverse reactions were mild to moderate, they usually started early in therapy, and most tended to subside even as therapy was continued.

2 Cases of orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported especially at the initiation of treatment.
3 See section 4.4 4 Cases of aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment of after treatment discontinuation.
5 Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4)
Discontinuation of duloxetine (particularly when abrupt) commonly leads to withdrawal symptoms.
Dizziness, sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia), sleep disturbances (including insomnia and intense dreams), fatigue, agitation or anxiety, nausea and/ or vomiting, tremor, headache, irritability, diarrhoea, hyperhydrosis and vertigo are the most commonly reported reactions.
Generally, for SSRIs and SNRIs, these events are mild to moderate and self-limiting, however, in
24 some patients they may be severe and/ or prolonged.
It is therefore advised that when duloxetine treatment is no longer required, gradual discontinuation by dose tapering should be carried out (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
In the 12 week acute phase of three clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain, small but statistically significant increases in fasting blood glucose were observed in duloxetine- treated patients HbA1c was stable in both duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients.
In the extension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, there was an increase in HbA1c in both the duloxetine and routine care groups, but the mean increase was 0.3% greater in the duloxetine- treated group.
There was also a small increase in fasting blood glucose and in total cholesterol in duloxetine-treated patients while those laboratory tests showed a slight decrease in the routine care group.
The heart rate-corrected QT interval in duloxetine-treated patients did not differ from that seen in placebo-treated patients.
No clinically significant differences were observed for QT, PR, QRS, or QTcB measurements between duloxetine-treated and placebo-treated patients.
4.9 Overdose
Cases of overdoses, alone or in combination with other medicinal products, with duloxetine doses of 4800mg were reported.
Some fatalities have occurred, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with duloxetine alone at a dose of approximately 1000 mg.
Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine alone or with mixed drugs) included somnolence, coma, serotonin syndrome, seizures,, vomiting andtachycardia.
No specific antidote is known for duloxetine but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment (such as with cyproheptadine and/ or temperature control) may be considered.
A free airway should be established.
Monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended, along with appropriate symptomatic and supportive measures.
Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients.
Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption.
Duloxetine has a large volume of distribution and forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, and exchange perfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Other antidepressants.
ATC code:
N06AX21.
Duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor.
It weakly inhibits dopamine reuptake with no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic and adrenergic receptors.
Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in various brain areas of animals.
Duloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain and attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain.
The pain inhibitory action of duloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the central nervous system.
Major Depressive Episodes:
XERISTAR was studied in a clinical programme involving 3,158 patients (1,285 patient-years of exposure) meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression.
The efficacy of XERISTAR at the recommended dose of 60 mg once a day was demonstrated in three out of three randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose acute studies in adult outpatients with major depressive disorder.
Overall, XERISTAR’ s efficacy has been demonstrated at daily doses between 60 and 120 mg in a total of five out of seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose acute studies in adult 25 outpatients with major depressive disorder.
XERISTAR demonstrated statistical superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the 17- item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score (including both the emotional and somatic symptoms of depression).
Response and remission rates were also statistically significantly higher with XERISTAR compared with placebo.
Only a small proportion of patients included in pivotal clinical trials had severe depression (baseline HAM-D > 25).
In a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 12-weeks of acute treatment with open-label XERISTAR 60 mg once daily were randomised to either XERISTAR 60 mg once daily or placebo for a further 6-months.
XERISTAR 60 mg once daily demonstrated a statistically significant superiority compared to placebo (p=0.004) on the primary outcome measure, the prevention of depressive relapse, as measured by time to relapse.
The incidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow-up period was 17% and 29% for duloxetine and placebo, respectively.
The effect of XERISTAR 60 mg once a day in elderly depressed patients (≥ 65 years) was specifically examined in a study that showed a statistically significative difference in the reduction of the HAMD17 score for duloxetine-treated patients compared to placebo.
Tolerability of XERISTAR 60 mg once day in elderly patients was comparable to that seen in the younger adults.
However, data on elderly patients exposed to the maximum dose (120mg per day) are limited and thus, caution is recommended when treating this population.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder XERISTAR demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo in five out of five studies including four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled acute studies and a relapse prevention study in adult patients with generalised anxiety disorder.
XERISTAR demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score.
Response and remission rates were also higher with XERISTAR compared to placebo.
XERISTAR showed comparable efficacy results to venlafaxine in terms of improvements on the HAM-A total score.
In a relapse prevention study, patients responding to 6 months of acute treatment with open-label XERISTAR were randomised to either XERISTAR or placebo for further 6-months.
XERISTAR 60 mg to 120 mg once daily demonstrated statistically significant superiority compared to placebo (p < 0.001) on the prevention of relapse, as measured by time to relapse.
The incidence of relapse during the 6-months double-blind follow-up period was 14% for XERISTAR and 42% for placebo.
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain:
The efficacy of XERISTAR as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain was established in 2 randomised, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) having diabetic neuropathic pain for at least 6 months.
Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder were excluded from these trials.
The primary outcome measure was the weekly mean of 24-hour average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point Likert scale.
In both studies, XERISTAR 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain compared with placebo.
The effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment.
The difference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.
At least 30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus 40% for placebo.
The corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% respectively.
Clinical response rates (50% or greater improvement in pain) were analysed according to whether or not the patient experienced somnolence during treatment.
For patients not experiencing somnolence, clinical response was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients on placebo.
Clinical response rates in patients experiencing somnolence were 60% on duloxetine and
26 30% on placebo.
Patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were unlikely to reach this level during further treatment.
Although data from a one-year open label study offer some evidence for longer-term efficacy, no conclusive efficacy data for treatments longer than 12 weeks duration are available from placebo- controlled studies.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer.
Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes (CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation.
The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine demonstrate large intersubject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, smoking status and CYP2D6 metaboliser status.
Duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post dose.
The absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%).
Food delays the time to reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (approximately 11%).
These changes do not have any clinical significance.
Duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins.
Duloxetine binds to both albumin and alpha-l acid glycoprotein.
Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.
Duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine.
Both cytochromes P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide conjugate of 4-hydroxy duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5hydroxy,6-methoxy duloxetine.
Based upon in vitro studies, the circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive.
The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2D6 has not been specifically investigated.
Limited data suggest that the plasma levels of duloxetine are higher in these patients.
The elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours).
After an intravenous dose the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/ hr to 46 l/ hr (mean of 36 l/ hr).
After an oral dose the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/ hr (mean 101 l/ hr).
Special populations:
Gender: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between males and females (apparent plasma clearance is approximatively 50% lower in females).
Based upon the overlap in the range of clearance, gender-based pharmacokinetic differences do not justify the recommendation for using a lower dose for female patients.
Age: pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between younger and elderly females (≥ 65 years) (AUC increases by about 25% and half-life is about 25% longer in the elderly), although the magnitude of these changes is not sufficient to justify adjustments to the dose.
As a general recommendation, caution should be exercised when treating the elderly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Renal impairment: end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher duloxetine Cmax and AUC values compared with healthy subjects.
Pharmacokinetic data on duloxetine is limited in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment: moderate liver disease (Child Pugh Class B) affected the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine.
Compared with healthy subjects, the apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine was 79% lower, the apparent terminal half-life was 2.3 times longer, and the AUC was 3.7 times higher in patients with moderate liver disease.
The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine and its metabolites have not been studied in patients with mild or severe hepatic insufficiency.
Nursing mothers:
The disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12-weeks postpartum.
Duloxetine is detected in breast milk, and steady-state concentrations in breast
27 milk are about one-fourth those in plasma.
The amount of duloxetine in breast milk is approximately 7 µg/ day while on 40 mg twice daily dosing.
Lactation did not influence duloxetine pharmacokinetics
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Duloxetine was not genotoxic in a standard battery of tests and was not carcinogenic in rats.
Multinucleated cells were seen in the liver in the absence of other histopathological changes in the rat carcinogenicity study.
The underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance are unknown.
Female mice receiving duloxetine for 2 years had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas at the high dose only (144 mg/ kg/ day), but these were considered to be secondary to hepatic microsomal enzyme induction.
The relevance of this mouse data to humans is unknown.
Female rats receiving duloxetine (45 mg/ kg/ day) before and during mating and early pregnancy had a decrease in maternal food consumption and body weight, oestrous cycle disruption, decreased live birth indices and progeny survival, and progeny growth retardation at systemic exposure levels estimated to be at the most at maximum clinical exposure (AUC).
In an embryotoxicity study in the rabbit, a higher incidence of cardiovascular and skeletal malformations was observed at systemic exposure levels below the maximum clinical exposure (AUC).
No malformations were observed in another study testing a higher dose of a different salt of duloxetine.
In prenatal/ postnatal toxicity studies in the rat, duloxetine induced adverse behavioural effects in the offspring at exposures below maximum clinical exposure (AUC).

Further information
1.
WHAT XERISTAR IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
XERISTAR increases the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the nervous system.
You have been given XERISTAR to treat either 1) depression, 2) generalised anxiety disorder (chronic feeling of anxiety or nervousness) or 3) a condition called diabetic neuropathic pain.
Neuropathic pain is a medical condition in which the pain is commonly described as burning, stabbing, stinging, shooting or aching or like an electric shock.
There may be loss of feeling in the affected area, or sensations such as touch, heat, cold or pressure may cause pain.
XERISTAR starts to work in most people with depression or anxiety within two weeks of starting treatment.
Your doctor may continue to give you XERISTAR when you are feeling better to prevent your depression or anxiety from returning.
The effect of XERISTAR may be noticeable in many patients with diabetic neuropathic pain within 1 week of treatment.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE XERISTAR
Do not take XERISTAR − If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to duloxetine or any of the other ingredients of XERISTAR. − If you are taking or have recently taken within the last 14 days, another antidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (see also below in section: ‘ Taking other medicines’). − If you have liver disease. − If you have severe kidney disease. − If you are taking fluvoxamine which is usually used to treat depression, ciprofloxacin or enoxacine which are used to treat some infections. − If you are taking other medicines containing duloxetine. − If you suffer from uncontrolled high blood pressure.
41 Take special care with XERISTAR The following are reasons why XERISTAR may not be suitable for you.
If any of them apply to you, talk to your doctor before you take the medicine:
- If yYou are taking other medicines to treat depression.
- You are taking a herbal treatment containing St.
John’ s Wort (Hypericum perforatum).
- You have kidney disease.
- You have had seizures (fits).
- You suffer from or have suffered from mania or bipolar disorder.
- You have eye problems, such as certain kinds of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye).
- You have a history of bleeding disorders (tendency to develop bruises).
- You are at risk of low sodium levels.
- If yYou have high blood pressure.
- You are currently being treated with another medicine which may cause liver damage.
- You are taking other medicines containing duloxetine.
- You have intolerance to some sugars (see below).
- You are considering stopping XERISTAR (see section 3).
XERISTAR may cause a sensation of restlessness or an inability to sit or stand still.
You should tell your doctor if this happens to you.
Thoughts of suicide and worsening of your depression or anxiety disorder If you are depressed and/ or have anxiety disorders you can sometimes have thoughts of harming or killing yourself.
These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer.
You may be more likely to think like this:
- If you have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself.
- If you are a young adult.
Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal
behaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an antidepressant.
If you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away.
You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet.
You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour.
Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age XERISTAR should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years.
Also, you should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side-effects such as suicide attempt, suicidal thoughts and hostility (predominantly aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger) when they take this class of medicines.
Despite this, your doctor may prescribe XERISTAR for patients under 18 because he/ she decides that this is in their best interests.
If your doctor has prescribed XERISTAR for a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to your doctor.
You should inform your doctor if any of the symptoms listed above develop or worsen when patients under 18 are taking XERISTAR.
Also, the long-term safety effects concerning growth, maturation, and cognitive and behavioural development of XERISTAR in this age group have not yet been demonstrated.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
The main ingredient of XERISTAR, duloxetine, is used in other medicines for other conditions (diabetic neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety and urinary incontinence).
Using more than one of these medicines at the same time should be avoided.
Check with your doctor if you are already taking other medicines containing duloxetine.
Your doctor should decide whether you can take XERISTAR with other medicines.
Do not start or stop taking any medicines, including those bought without a prescription and herbal remedies, before checking with your doctor.
42 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs):
You should not take XERISTAR if you are taking, or have recently taken within the last 14 days, another antidepressant medicine called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).
Taking a MAOI together with many prescription medicines, including XERISTAR, can cause serious or even life-threatening side effects.
You must wait at least 14 days after you have stopped taking an MAOI before you can take XERISTAR.
Also, you need to wait at least 5 days after you stop taking XERISTAR before you take a MAOI.
Medicines that cause sleepiness:
Tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines which cause you to be sleepy.
These would include medicines prescribed by your doctor including benzodiazepines, strong painkillers, antipsychotics, phenobarbital, antihistamines.
Serotonin syndrome: you should tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines that act in a similar way to duloxetine.
Examples of these medicines include: triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, SSRIs (such as paroxetine and fluoxetine), tricyclics (such as clomipramine, amitriptyline), pethidine, St John’ s Wort and venlafaxine.
These medicines increase the risk of side effects; if you get any unusual symptom taking any of these medicines together with XERISTAR, you should see your doctor.
Oral -anticoagulants:
You should tell you doctor if you are taking oral – anticoagulants (medicines which thin the blood).
These medicines might increase the risk of bleeding.
Taking XERISTAR with food and drink XERISTAR may be taken with or without food.
Care should be taken if you drink alcohol while you are being treated with XERISTAR.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you become pregnant, or you are trying to become pregnant, while you are taking XERISTAR.
You should use XERISTAR only after discussing the potential benefits and any potential risks to your unborn child with your doctor.
You should ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice if you are breast-feeding.
The use of XERISTAR while breastfeeding is not recommended.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines XERISTAR may make you feel sleepy or dizzy.
Do not drive or use any tools or machines until you know how XERISTAR affects you.
Important information about some of the ingredients of XERISTAR XERISTAR contains sucrose.
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
3.
HOW TO TAKE XERISTAR
Always take XERISTAR exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
For depression and diabetic neuropathic pain:
The usual dose of XERISTAR is one capsule (60 mg duloxetine) once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you.
For generalised anxiety disorder:
The usual starting dose of XERISTAR is 30 mg once a day after which most patients will receive 60 mg once a day, but your doctor will prescribe the dose that is right for you.
The dose may be adjusted up to 120 mg a day based on your response to XERISTAR.
43 XERISTAR is for oral use.
You should swallow your capsule whole with a drink of water.
To help you remember to take XERISTAR, you may find it easier to take it at the same times every day.
Talk with your doctor about how long you should keep taking XERISTAR.
Do not stop taking XERISTAR without talking to your doctor.
If you have further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you take more XERISTAR than you should Call your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you take more than the amount of XERISTAR prescribed by your doctor.
If you forget to take XERISTAR Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.
However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take only a single dose as usual.
Do not take more than the daily amount of XERISTAR that has been prescribed for you in one day.
If you stop taking XERISTAR Do not stop taking your capsules without the advice of your doctor even if you feel better.
If your doctor thinks that you no longer need XERISTAR he will ask you to reduce your dose over at least 2 weeks before stopping treatment altogether.
Some patients who stop taking XERISTAR suddenly have had symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, tingling feelings like pins and needles, sleep disturbances (vivid dreams, nightmares, inability to sleep), feeling restless or agitated, feeling anxious, feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting), tremor (shakiness), headaches, feeling irritable, diarrhoea, excessive sweating or vertigo.
These symptoms are usually not serious and disappear within a few days, but if you have symptoms that are troublesome you should ask your doctor for advice.
