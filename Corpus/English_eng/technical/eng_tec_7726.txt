ULTRATARD
ris EPAR summary for the public
tho This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to
au reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part
r of the EPAR).
What is Ultratard? ge lon Ultratard is an insulin suspension for injection.
Ultratard is supplied as 40 or 100 IU strengths in vials.
Ultratard contains the active ingredient insulin human (rDNA).
What is Ultratard used for? no
Ultratard is used in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Ultratard can be used in type 1 diabetes, when the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and in type 2 diabetes, when the body is not able to use insulin effectively.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription. t uc
How is Ultratard used?
Ultratard is given subcutaneously (under the skin) by injection, usually in the thigh.
If convenient it may also be given in the abdominal wall (tummy), the buttocks or the deltoid region (shoulder).
The rod
patient's blood sugar should be tested regularly to find the lowest effective dose.
In type 1 diabetes, the dosage varies between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/ kg (0.7 and 1.0 IU/ kg in children before puberty), in type 2 diabetes the dosage is 0.3 to 0.6 IU/ kg.
Ultratard is a long-acting insulin, it can be given as a once daily or twice daily injection, with or without a fast-acting insulin (at meal times), according to the lP
doctor’ s recommendation.
How does Ultratard work? na
Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the blood sugar.
Ultratard is a replacement insulin which identical to the insulin made by the pancreas. The active ingredient of Ultratard, insulin human (rDNA), is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant i
technology ’.
The insulin is made by a yeast that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to dic
produce insulin.
Ultratard contains insulin mixed with another substance, zinc, in particles from which the insulin is absorbed much more slowly during the day; and this gives Ultratard a longer duration of action.
The replacement insulin acts in same way as naturally produced insulin and helps glucose enter Me
cells from the blood.
By controlling the blood sugar, the symptoms and complications of diabetes are reduced.

Ultratard has been studied in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and it has been compared to other types of insulin (porcine, human).
The studies measured the level of fasting blood sugar or a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well the blood sugar is controlled.
ed What benefit has Ultratard shown during the studies?
Ultratard led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c, indicating that blood sugar levels had been controlled to a similar level to that seen with other human insulin.
Ultratard was effective for both
ris Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
What is the risk associated with Ultratard?
tho Ultratard may cause hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).
For the full description of the side effects reported with Ultratard, please see the Package Leaflet.
Ultratard should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin human (rDNA) or to any of the other ingredients.
Ultratard doses might also need to be adjusted when given with a
au number of other medicines which may have an effect on blood sugar (the full list is available in the Package Leaflet).
r Why has Ultratard been approved?
ge The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Ultratard’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of diabetes.
They recommended that Ultratard be given marketing authorisation. lon Other information about Ultratard:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Ultratard to Novo Nordisk A/ S in on 7 October 2002. no
