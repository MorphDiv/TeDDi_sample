ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Comtess 200 mg film-coated tablets
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each film-coated tablet contains 200 mg entacapone.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet
Brownish-orange, oval, biconvex film-coated tablet with "COMT" engraved on one side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Entacapone is indicated as an adjunct to standard preparations of levodopa/ benserazide or levodopa/ carbidopa for use in adult patients with Parkinson’ s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Entacapone should only be used in combination with levodopa/ benserazide or levodopa/ carbidopa.
The prescribing information for these levodopa preparations is applicable to their concomitant use with entacapone.
Posology
One 200 mg tablet is taken with each levodopa/ dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose.
The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg ten times daily, i. e.
2,000 mg of entacapone.
Entacapone enhances the effects of levodopa.
Hence, to reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic adverse reactions, e. g. dyskinesias, nausea, vomiting and hallucinations, it is often necessary to adjust levodopa dosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment.
The daily dose of levodopa should be reduced by about 10-30% by extending the dosing intervals and/ or by reducing the amount of levodopa per dose, according to the clinical condition of the patient.
If entacapone treatment is discontinued, it is necessary to adjust the dosing of other antiparkinsonian treatments, especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient level of control of the parkinsonian symptoms.
Entacapone increases the bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/ benserazide preparations slightly (5-10%) more than from standard levodopa/ carbidopa preparations.
Hence, patients who are taking standard levodopa/ benserazide preparations may need a larger reduction of levodopa dose when entacapone is initiated.
Renal impairment:
Renal insufficiency does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone and there is no need for dose adjustment.
However, for patients who are receiving dialysis therapy, a longer dosing interval may be considered (see section 5.2).
2 Hepatic impairment: see section 4.3.
Elderly:
No dosage adjustment of entacapone is required for elderly patients.
Children:
Comtess is not recommended for use in children below age 18 due to lack of data of safety and efficacy.
Method of administration
Entacapone is administered orally and simultaneously with each levodopa/ carbidopa or levodopa/ benserazide dose.
Entacapone can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
- Hepatic impairment.
- Phaeochromocytoma.
- Concomitant use of entacapone and non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO-A and MAO-B)
inhibitors (e. g. phenelzine, tranylcypromine).
- Concomitant use of a selective MAO-A inhibitor plus a selective MAO-B inhibitor and entacapone
(see section 4.5).
- A previous history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/ or non-traumatic
rhabdomyolysis.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Rhabdomyolysis secondary to severe dyskinesias or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been observed rarely in patients with Parkinson’ s disease.
NMS, including rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, is characterised by motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus, tremor), mental status changes (e. g. agitation, confusion, coma), hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase.
In individual cases, only some of these symptoms and/ or findings may be evident.
Neither NMS nor rhabdomyolysis have been reported in association with entacapone treatment from controlled trials in which entacapone was discontinued abruptly.
Since the introduction into the market, isolated cases of NMS have been reported, especially following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of entacapone and other concomitant dopaminergic medicinal products.
When considered necessary, withdrawal of entacapone and other dopaminergic treatment should proceed slowly, and if signs and/ or symptoms occur despite a slow withdrawal of entacapone, an increase in levodopa dosage may be necessary.
Because of its mechanism of action, entacapone may interfere with the metabolism of medicinal products containing a catechol group and potentiate their action.
Thus, entacapone should be administered cautiously to patients being treated with medicinal products metabolised by catechol-O- methyl transferase (COMT), e. g. rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, and apomorphine (see also section 4.5).
Entacapone is always given as an adjunct to levodopa treatment.
Hence, the precautions valid for levodopa treatment should also be taken into account for entacapone treatment.
Entacapone increases the bioavailability of levodopa from standard levodopa/ benserazide preparations 5-10% more than from standard levodopa/ carbidopa preparations.
Consequently, adverse dopaminergic reactions may be more frequent when entacapone is added to levodopa/ benserazide treatment (see also section 4.8).
To reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic adverse reactions, it is often necessary to adjust levodopa
3 dosage within the first days to first weeks after initiating entacapone treatment, according to the clinical condition of the patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Entacapone may aggravate levodopa-induced orthostatic hypotension.
Entacapone should be given cautiously to patients who are taking other medicinal products which may cause orthostatic hypotension.
In clinical studies, undesirable dopaminergic effects, e. g. dyskinesia, were more common in patients who received entacapone and dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine), selegiline or amantadine compared to those who received placebo with this combination.
The doses of other antiparkinsonian medicinal products may need to be adjusted when entacapone treatment is initiated.
Entacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of sudden sleep onset in patients with Parkinson’ s disease and caution should therefore be exercised when driving or operating machines (see also section 4.7).
For patients experiencing diarrhoea, a follow-up of weight is recommended in order to avoid potential excessive weight decrease.
Pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality have been reported in Parkinson’ s disease patients treated with dopamine agonists and other dopaminergic treatments such as entacapone in association with levodopa.
For patients who experience progressive anorexia, asthenia and weight decrease within a relatively short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be considered.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction of entacapone with carbidopa has been observed with the recommended treatment schedule.
Pharmacokinetic interaction with benserazide has not been studied.
In single-dose studies in healthy volunteers, no interactions were observed between entacapone and imipramine or between entacapone and moclobemide.
Similarly, no interactions between entacapone and selegiline were observed in repeated-dose studies in parkinsonian patients.
However, the experience of the clinical use of entacapone with several medicinal products, including MAO-A inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as desipramine, maprotiline and venlafaxine, and medicinal products that are metabolised by COMT (e. g. catechol-structured compounds: rimiterole, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha- methyldopa, apomorphine, and paroxetine) is still limited.
Caution should be exercised when these medicinal products are used concomitantly with entacapone (see also sections 4.3 and section 4.4).
Entacapone may be used with selegiline (a selective MAO-B inhibitor), but the daily dose of selegiline should not exceed 10 mg.
Entacapone may form chelates with iron in the gastrointestinal tract.
Entacapone and iron preparations should be taken at least 2-3 hours apart (see section 4.8).
Entacapone binds to human albumin binding site II which also binds several other medicinal products, including diazepam and ibuprofen.
Clinical interaction studies with diazepam and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory medicinal products have not been carried out.
According to in vitro studies, significant displacement is not anticipated at therapeutic concentrations of the medicinal products.
Due to its affinity to cytochrome P450 2C9 in vitro (see section 5.2), entacapone may potentially interfere with medicinal products with metabolism dependent on this isoenzyme, such as S-warfarin.
However, in an interaction study with healthy volunteers, entacapone did not change the plasma levels of S-warfarin, while the AUC for R-warfarin increased on average by 18% [CI90 11– 26%].
The INR
4 values increased on average by 13% [CI90 6– 19%].
Thus, control of INR is recommended when entacapone treatment is initiated for patients receiving warfarin.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
No overt teratogenic or primary foetotoxic effects were observed in animal studies in which the exposure levels of entacapone were markedly higher than the therapeutic exposure levels.
As there is no experience in pregnant women, entacapone should not be used during pregnancy.
In animal studies entacapone was excreted in milk.
The safety of entacapone in infants is unknown.
Women should not breast-feed during treatment with entacapone.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Comtess in association with levodopa may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Entacapone may, together with levodopa, cause dizziness and symptomatic orthostatism.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines.
Patients being treated with entacapone in association with levodopa and presenting with somnolence and/ or sudden sleep onset episodes must be instructed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e. g. operating machines) until such recurrent episodes have resolved (see also section 4.4).
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reactions caused by entacapone relate to the increased dopaminergic activity and occur most commonly at the beginning of the treatment.
Reduction of levodopa dosage decreases the severity and frequency of these reactions.
The other major class of adverse reactions are gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhoea.
Urine may be discoloured reddish-brown by entacapone, but this is a harmless phenomenon.
Usually the adverse reactions caused by entacapone are mild to moderate.
In clinical studies the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of entacapone treatment have been gastrointestinal symptoms (e. g. diarrhoea, 2.5%) and increased dopaminergic adverse reactions of levodopa (e. g. dyskinesias, 1.7%).
Dyskinesias (27%), nausea (11%), diarrhoea (8%), abdominal pain (7%) and dry mouth (4.2%) were reported significantly more often with entacapone than with placebo in pooled data from clinical studies involving 406 patients taking the medicinal product and 296 patients taking placebo.
Some of the adverse reactions, such as dyskinesia, nausea, and abdominal pain, may be more common with the higher doses (1,400 to 2,000 mg per day) than with the lower doses of entacapone.
The following adverse drug reactions, listed below in Table 1, have been accumulated both from clinical studies with entacapone and since the introduction of entacapone into the market.

Entacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with isolated cases of excessive daytime somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes.
Parkinson’ s disease patients treated with dopamine agonists and other dopaminergic treatments such as entacapone in association with levodopa, especially at high doses, have been reported as exhibiting signs of pathological gambling, increased libido and hypersexuality, which were generally reversible upon reduction of the dose or treatment discontinuation.
Isolated cases of NMS have been reported following abrupt reduction or discontinuation of entacapone and other dopaminergic treatments.
Isolated cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported.
4.9 Overdose
The post-marketing data include isolated cases of overdose in which the reported highest daily dose of entacapone has been 16,000 mg.
The acute symptoms and signs in these cases of overdose included confusion, decreased activity, somnolence, hypotonia, skin discolouration and urticaria.
Management of acute overdose is symptomatic.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other dopaminergic agents, ATC code:
NO4BX02.
Entacapone belongs to a new therapeutic class, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors.
It is a reversible, specific, and mainly peripherally acting COMT inhibitor designed for concomitant administration with levodopa preparations.
Entacapone decreases the metabolic loss of levodopa to 3- O-methyldopa (3-OMD) by inhibiting the COMT enzyme.
This leads to a higher levodopa AUC.
The amount of levodopa available to the brain is increased.
Entacapone thus prolongs the clinical response to levodopa.
Entacapone inhibits the COMT enzyme mainly in peripheral tissues.
COMT inhibition in red blood cells closely follows the plasma concentrations of entacapone, thus clearly indicating the reversible nature of COMT inhibition.
Clinical studies In two phase III double-blind studies in a total of 376 patients with Parkinson’ s disease and end-of- dose motor fluctuations, entacapone or placebo was given with each levodopa/ dopa decarboxylase inhibitor dose.
The results are given in Table 2.
In study I, daily ON time (hours) was measured from home diaries and in study II, the proportion of daily ON time.

5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
General characteristics of the active substance
Absorption There are large intra- and interindividual variations in the absorption of entacapone.
The peak concentration (Cmax) in plasma is usually reached about one hour after ingestion of a 200 mg entacapone tablet.
The substance is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism.
The bioavailability of entacapone is about 35% after an oral dose.
Food does not affect the absorption of entacapone to any significant extent.
7 Distribution After absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, entacapone is rapidly distributed to the peripheral tissues with a distribution volume of 20 litres at steady state (Vdss).
Approximately 92% of the dose is eliminated during ß-phase with a short elimination half-life of 30 minutes.
The total clearance of entacapone is about 800 ml/ min.
Entacapone is extensively bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin.
In human plasma the unbound fraction is about 2.0% in the therapeutic concentration range.
At therapeutic concentrations, entacapone does not displace other extensively bound substances (e. g. warfarin, salicylic acid, phenylbutazone, or diazepam), nor is it displaced to any significant extent by any of these substances at therapeutic or higher concentrations.
Metabolism A small amount of entacapone, the (E)-isomer, is converted to its (Z)-isomer.
The (E)-isomer accounts for 95% of the AUC of entacapone.
The (Z)-isomer and traces of other metabolites account for the remaining 5%.
Data from in vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations indicate that entacapone inhibits cytochrome P450 2C9 (IC50 ∼ 4 µM).
Entacapone showed little or no inhibition of other types of P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A and CYP2C19) (see section 4.5).
Elimination The elimination of entacapone occurs mainly by non-renal metabolic routes.
It is estimated that 80- 90% of the dose is excreted in faeces, although this has not been confirmed in man.
Approximately 10- 20% is excreted in urine.
Only traces of entacapone are found unchanged in urine.
The major part (95%) of the product excreted in urine is conjugated with glucuronic acid.
Of the metabolites found in urine only about 1% have been formed through oxidation.
Characteristics in patients
The pharmacokinetic properties of entacapone are similar in both young and elderly adults.
The metabolism of the medicinal product is slowed in patients with mild to moderate liver insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class A and B), which leads to an increased plasma concentration of entacapone in both the absorption and elimination phases (see section 4.3).
Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone.
However, a longer dosing interval may be considered for patients who are receiving dialysis therapy.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.
In repeated dose toxicity studies, anaemia most likely due to iron chelating properties of entacapone was observed.
Regarding reproduction toxicity, decreased foetal weight and a slightly delayed bone development were noticed in rabbits at systemic exposure levels in the therapeutic range.

Further information
1.
WHAT COMTESS IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Comtess is used together with levodopa to treat Parkinson’ s disease.
Comtess improves the therapeutic effect of levodopa in relieving the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Comtess has no antiparkinsonian activity without levodopa.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE COMTESS
Do not take Comtess – if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to entacapone or any of the other ingredients of Comtess; – if you have a tumour of the adrenal gland (known as pheochromocytoma; this may increase the risk of severe high blood pressure); – if you are taking certain antidepressants (ask your doctor or pharmacist whether your antidepressive medicine can be taken together with Comtess); – if you have liver disease; – if you have ever suffered from a rare reaction to antipsychotic medicines called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/ or a rare muscle disorder called non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis.
Take special care with Comtess
- if you are taking a medicine which may cause low blood pressure when rising from a chair or
bed;
- if you experience diarrhoea, monitoring of your weight is recommended in order to avoid
potentially excessive weight loss;
- if you experience excessive gambling or excessive sexual activity.
- if you experience progressive anorexia, asthenia (weakness, exhaustion) and weight decrease
within a relatively short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be considered.
The dose of other antiparkinsonian medicines may need to be adjusted when you start taking Comtess.
Follow the instructions that your doctor has given you.
17 Entacapone taken with levodopa may cause drowsiness and may cause you to sometimes suddenly fall asleep.
If this happens, you should not drive or use any tools or machines (see section ” Driving and using machines”).
There have been isolated cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), especially when treatment with both entacapone and other dopaminergic medicines has been abruptly discontinued or reduced.
For the characteristics of NMS see section 4.
Your doctor may advise you to slowly discontinue the treatment with entacapone and other dopaminergic medicines.
Children Experience with Comtess in patients under 18 years is limited.
Therefore, the use of Comtess in children cannot be recommended.
Taking other medicines Comtess may increase the effects of other medicinal products (e. g. those containing rimiterol, isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, and apomorphine).
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or herbal medicines.
Comtess may make it harder for you to digest iron.
Therefore, do not take Comtess and iron supplements at the same time.
After taking one of them, wait at least 2 to 3 hours before taking the other.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Do not use Comtess during pregnancy or if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines Comtess taken together with levodopa may lower your blood pressure, which may make you feel light-headed or dizzy.
Be particularly careful when you drive or when you use tools or machinery.
Comtess taken with levodopa may make you feel very drowsy, or cause you to sometimes find yourself suddenly falling asleep.
If this happens, you must not drive or do anything else that requires you to be alert (e. g. using tools or machines) until you are clear of such problems.
Otherwise you may put yourself and others at risk of serious injury or even death.
3.
HOW TO TAKE COMTESS
Always take Comtess exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Comtess is taken together with preparations containing levodopa (either levodopa/ carbidopa preparations or levodopa/ benserazide preparations).
You may also use other antiparkinsonian medicines at the same time.
The usual dose of Comtess is one 200 mg tablet with each levodopa dose.
If you are receiving dialysis for renal insufficiency, your doctor may tell you to extend the interval between doses.
The maximum recommended dose is 10 tablets per day, i. e.
2,000 mg of Comtess.
If you take more Comtess than you should In the event of an overdose, consult your doctor or the nearest hospital immediately.
If you forget to take Comtess If you forget to take the Comtess tablet with your levodopa dose, you should continue the treatment by taking the next Comtess tablet with your next levodopa dose.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten tablet.
18 If you stop taking Comtess Do not stop taking Comtess unless your doctor tells you to.
In such a case your doctor may need to re-adjust the dosage of your other antiparkinsonian medicines.
Abrupt discontinuation of both Comtess and other antiparkinsonian medicines may result in unwanted side effects.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Comtess can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Usually side effects caused by Comtess are mild to moderate.
The frequencies are defined as:
Very common (affects more than 1 patient in 10) Common (affects 1 to 10 patients in 100) Uncommon (affects 1 to 10 patients in 1,000) Rare (affects 1 to 10 patients in 10,000) Very rare (affects less than 1 patient in 10,000) Not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).
Very common Uncontrollable movements (dyskinesias), feeling sick (nausea) and harmless reddish-brown discoloration of urine.
Common Uncontrollable movements (hyperkinesias), being sick (vomiting), worsening of symptoms of Parkinson’ s disease, dizziness, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation, dry mouth, hallucinations (seeing/ hearing/ feeling/ smelling things that are not really there), prolonged muscle contractions (dystonia), tiredness, increased sweating, sleeplessness, vivid dreams, fall and confusion.
Rare Rashes and abnormal results in liver function test.
Very rare Mental restlessness, decreased appetite, weight decrease, hives.
The exact frequencies of these side effects are not known but are based on reports received since the product has been on the market: colitis (inflammation of the colon), hepatitis and skin, hair, beard and nail discolorations.
The side effects are often caused by the increased effects of levodopa therapy and are most common at the start of treatment.
Some, such as uncontrollable movements, nausea and abdominal pain, may also be more common with higher doses (1,400 to 2,000 mg per day).
If you experience such effects at the start of treatment with Comtess you should contact your doctor, who may decide to adjust your dosage of levodopa.
