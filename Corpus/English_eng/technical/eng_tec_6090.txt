Equalize: performs histogram equalization to the image.
Fuzz: merges colors within a distance are considered equal.
Gray scales: converts colors images to gray scales image.
Increase contrast: enhances the image contrast.
Monochrome: transforms the image to black and white.
Negate: replaces every pixel with its complementary color.
Normalize: transforms image to span the full range of color values.
Segment: segments an image by analyzing the histograms of the color components.
Trim: trims an image (fuzz reverse technic).
