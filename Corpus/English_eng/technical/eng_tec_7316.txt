Usage: quilt [--trace[=verbose]] [--quiltrc=XX] command [-h] ...
quilt --version
Commands are:
Global options:

--trace
 Runs the command in bash trace mode (-x). For internal debugging.

--quiltrc file
 Use the specified configuration file instead of ~/.quiltrc (or
 /etc/quilt.quiltrc if ~/.quiltrc does not exist). See the pdf
 documentation for details about its possible contents.

--version
 Print the version number and exit immediately.
Usage: quilt add [-p patch] {file} ...\
Add one or more files to the topmost or named patch. Files must be
added to the patch before being modified. Files that are modified by
patches already applied on top of the specified patch cannot be added.

-p patch
 Patch to add files to.
File \\`%s' is located below \\`%s'\
Patch %s is not in series\
Patch %s is not applied\
No patches applied\
File %s is already in patch %s\
File %s modified by patch %s\
Cannot add symbolic link %s\
Failed to back up file %s\
File %s added to patch %s\
Usage: quilt annotate {file}\
Print an annotated listing of the specified file showing which
patches modify which lines.
Usage: quilt applied [patch]\
Print a list of applied patches, or all patches up to and including the
specified patch in the file series.
Patch is not applied\
Usage: quilt delete [patch | -n]\
Remove the specified or topmost patch from the series file. If the
patch is applied, quilt will attempt to remove it first. (Only the
topmost patch can be removed right now.)

-n Delete the next patch after topmost, rather than the specified
 or topmost patch.
No next patch\
Patch %s is currently applied\
Removed patch %s\
Failed to remove patch %s\
Usage: quilt diff [-p n] [-u|-U num|-c|-C num] [--combine patch|-z] [-R] [-P patch] [--snapshot] [--diff=utility] [--no-timestamps] [--no-index] [--sort] [--color] [file ...]\
Produces a diff of the specified file(s) in the topmost or specified
patch. If no files are specified, all files that are modified are
included.

-p n Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).

-u, -U num, -c, -C num
 Create a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context. Create
 a context diff (-c, -C) with num lines of context. The number of
 context lines defaults to 3.

--no-timestamps
 Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.

--no-index
 Do not output Index: lines.

-z Write to standard output the changes that have been made
 relative to the topmost or specified patch.

-R Create a reverse diff.

-P patch
 Create a diff for the specified patch. (Defaults to the topmost
 patch.)

--combine patch
 Create a combined diff for all patches between this patch and
 the patch specified with -P. A patch name of \\"-\\" is equivalent
 to specifying the first applied patch.

--snapshot
 Diff against snapshot (see \\`quilt snapshot -h').

--diff=utility
 Use the specified utility for generating the diff. The utility
 is invoked with the original and new file name as arguments.

--color[=always|auto|never]
 Use syntax coloring.

--sort Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original order.
Options \\`-c patch', \\`--snapshot', and \\`-z' cannot be combined.\
Cannot diff patches with -p%s, please specify -p0 or -p1 instead\
Patch %s not applied before patch %s\
Failed to copy files to temporary directory\
Failed to patch temporary files\
File %s is not being modified\
Diff failed, aborting\
More recent patches modify files in patch %s\
Usage: quilt edit file ...\
Edit the specified file(s) in \\$EDITOR (%s) after adding it (them) to
the topmost patch.
Usage: quilt files [-v] [-a] [-l] [--combine patch] [patch]\
Print the list of files that the topmost or specified patch changes.

-a List all files in all applied patches.

-l Add patch name to output.

-v Verbose, more user friendly output.

--combine patch
 Create a listing for all patches between this patch and
 the topmost applied patch. A patch name of \\"-\\" is equivalent
 to specifying the first applied patch.
Patch %s is not in series file\
Usage: quilt fold [-p strip-level]\
Integrate the patch read from standard input into the topmost patch:
After making sure that all files modified are part of the topmost
patch, the patch is applied with the specified strip level (which
defaults to 1).

-p strip-level
 The number of pathname components to strip from file names
 when applying patchfile.
File %s may be corrupted\
Usage: quilt fork [new_name]\
Fork the topmost patch. Forking a patch means creating a verbatim copy
of it under a new name, and use that new name instead of the original
one in the current series. This is useful when a patch has to be
modified, but the original version of it should be preserved, e.g.
because it is used in another series, or for the history. A typical
sequence of commands would be: fork, edit, refresh.

If new_name is missing, the name of the forked patch will be the current
patch name, followed by \\"-2\\". If the patch name already ends in a
dash-and-number, the number is further incremented (e.g., patch.diff,
patch-2.diff, patch-3.diff).
Patch %s exists already, please choose a new name\
Fork of patch %s to patch %s failed\
Fork of patch %s created as %s\
Usage: quilt graph [--all] [--reduce] [--lines[=num]] [--edge-labels=files] [patch]\
Generate a dot(1) directed graph showing the dependencies between
applied patches. A patch depends on another patch if both touch the same
file or, with the --lines option, if their modifications overlap. Unless
otherwise specified, the graph includes all patches that the topmost
patch depends on.
When a patch name is specified, instead of the topmost patch, create a
graph for the specified patch. The graph will include all other patches
that this patch depends on, as well as all patches that depend on this
patch.

--all Generate a graph including all applied patches and their
 dependencies. (Unapplied patches are not included.)

--reduce
 Eliminate transitive edges from the graph.

--lines[=num]
 Compute dependencies by looking at the lines the patches modify.
 Unless a different num is specified, two lines of context are
 included.

--edge-labels=files
 Label graph edges with the file names that the adjacent patches
 modify.

-T ps Directly produce a PostScript output file.
Usage: quilt grep [-h|options] {pattern}\
Grep through the source files, recursively, skipping patches and quilt
meta-information. If no filename argument is given, the whole source
tree is searched. Please see the grep(1) manual page for options.

-h Print this help. The grep -h option can be passed after a
 double-dash (--). Search expressions that start with a dash
 can be passed after a second double-dash (-- --).
Usage: quilt header [-a|-r|-e] [--backup] [--strip-diffstat] [--strip-trailing-whitespace] [patch]\
Print or change the header of the topmost or specified patch.

-a, -r, -e
 Append to (-a) or replace (-r) the exiting patch header, or
 edit (-e) the header in \\$EDITOR (%s). If none of these options is
 given, print the patch header.
 
--strip-diffstat
 Strip diffstat output from the header.

--strip-trailing-whitespace
 Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines of the header.

--backup
 Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as patch~.
Replaced header of patch %s\
Appended text to header of patch %s\
Usage: quilt import [-f] [-p num] [-n patch] patchfile ...\
Import external patches.

-p num
 Number of directory levels to strip when applying (default=1)

-n patch
 Patch filename to use inside quilt. This option can only be
 used when importing a single patch.

-f Overwite/update existing patches.
Option \\`-n' can only be used when importing a single patch\
Patch %s is applied\
Patch %s exists. Replace with -f.\
Replacing patch %s with new version\
Importing patch %s (stored as %s)\
Failed to import patch %s\
Failed to insert patch %s into file series\
Usage: quilt mail {--mbox file|--send} [--from ...] [--to ...] [--cc ...] [--bcc ...] [--subject ...]\
Create mail messages from all patches in the series file, and either store
them in a mailbox file, or send them immediately. The editor is opened
with a template for the introductory message. Please see the file
%s for details.

--mbox file
 Store all messages in the specified file in mbox format. The mbox
 can later be sent using formail, for example.

--send
 Send the messages directly using %s.

--from, --subject
 The values for the From and Subject headers to use.

--to, --cc, --bcc
 Append a recipient to the To, Cc, or Bcc header.
Usage: quilt new {patchname}\
Create a new patch with the specified file name, and insert it after the
topmost patch in the patch series file.
Patch %s exists already\
Failed to create patch %s\
Patch %s is now on top\
Usage: quilt next [patch]\
Print the name of the next patch after the specified or topmost patch in
the series file.
Usage: quilt patches {file}\
Print the list of patches that modify the specified file. (Uses a
heuristic to determine which files are modified by unapplied patches.
Note that this heuristic is much slower than scanning applied patches.)

-v Verbose, more user friendly output.
Usage: quilt pop [-afRqv] [num|patch]\
Remove patch(es) from the stack of applied patches. Without options,
the topmost patch is removed. When a number is specified, remove the
specified number of patches. When a patch name is specified, remove
patches until the specified patch end up on top of the stack. Patch
names may include the patches/ prefix, which means that filename
completion can be used.

-a Remove all applied patches.

-f Force remove. The state before the patch(es) were applied will
 be restored from backup files.

-R Always verify if the patch removes cleanly; don't rely on
 timestamp checks.

-q Quiet operation.

-v Verbose operation.
Patch %s does not remove cleanly (refresh it or enforce with -f)\
Patch %s appears to be empty, removing\
Removing patch %s\
Patch %s needs to be refreshed first.\
No patch removed\
Now at patch %s\
Usage: quilt previous [patch]\
Print the name of the previous patch before the specified or topmost
patch in the series file.
Usage: quilt push [-afqv] [--leave-rejects] [num|patch]\
Apply patch(es) from the series file. Without options, the next patch
in the series file is applied. When a number is specified, apply the
specified number of patches. When a patch name is specified, apply
all patches up to and including the specified patch. Patch names may
include the patches/ prefix, which means that filename completion can
be used.

-a Apply all patches in the series file.

-f Force apply, even if the patch has rejects.

-q Quiet operation.

-v Verbose operation.

--leave-rejects
 Leave around the reject files patch produced, even if the patch
 is not actually applied.

--interactive
 Allow the patch utility to ask how to deal with conflicts. If
 this option is not given, the -f option will be passed to the 
 patch program.

--color[=always|auto|never]
 Use syntax coloring.
Interrupted by user; patch %s was not applied.\
Applying patch %s\
Patch %s does not exist; applied empty patch\
Patch %s appears to be empty; applied\

Usage: quilt refresh [-p n] [-f] [--no-timestamps] [--no-index] [--diffstat] [--sort] [--backup] [--strip-trailing-whitespace] [patch]\
Refreshes the specified patch, or the topmost patch by default.
Documentation that comes before the actual patch in the patch file is
retained.

It is possible to refresh patches that are not on top. If any patches
on top of the patch to refresh modify the same files, the script aborts
by default. Patches can still be refreshed with -f. In that case this
script will print a warning for each shadowed file, changes by more
recent patches will be ignored, and only changes in files that have not
been modified by any more recent patches will end up in the specified
patch.

-p n Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 supported).

-u, -U num, -c, -C num
 Create a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context. Create
 a context diff (-c, -C) with num lines of context. The number of
 context lines defaults to 3.

--no-timestamps
 Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.
 
--no-index
 Do not output Index: lines.

--diffstat
 Add a diffstat section to the patch header, or replace the
 existing diffstat section.

-f Enforce refreshing of a patch that is not on top.

--backup
 Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as patch~.

--sort Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original order.

--strip-trailing-whitespace
 Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines.
Cannot refresh patches with -p%s, please specify -p0 or -p1 instead\
More recent patches modify files in patch %s. Enforce refresh with -f.\
Cannot use --strip-trailing-whitespace on a patch that has shadowed files.\
Nothing in patch %s\
Patch %s is unchanged\
Refreshed patch %s\
Usage: quilt remove [-p patch] {file} ...\
Remove one or more files from the topmost or named patch. Files that
are modified by patches on top of the specified patch cannot be removed.

-p patch
 Patch to rename.
Patch %s exists already, please choose a different name\
Renaming of patch %s to %s failed\
Patch %s renamed to %s\
Usage: quilt series [-v]\
Print the names of all patches in the series file.

-v Verbose, more user friendly output.
Usage: quilt setup [-d path-prefix] [-v] {specfile|seriesfile}\

The -v option will show rpm's output\
Unpacking archive %s\
Usage: quilt snapshot [-d]\
Take a snapshot of the current working state. After taking the snapshot,
the tree can be modified in the usual ways, including pushing and
popping patches. A diff against the tree at the moment of the
snapshot can be generated with \\`quilt diff --snapshot'.

-d Only remove current snapshot.
Usage: quilt top\
Print the name of the topmost patch on the current stack of applied
patches.
Usage: quilt unapplied [patch]\
Print a list of patches that are not applied, or all patches that follow
the specified patch in the series file.
Usage: quilt upgrade\
Upgrade the meta-data in a working tree from an old version of quilt to the
current version. This command is only needed when the quilt meta-data format
has changed, and the working tree still contains old-format meta-data. In that
case, quilt will request to run \\`quilt upgrade'.
The quilt meta-data in %s are already in the version %s format; nothing to do\
Converting meta-data to version %s\
Conversion failed\
Please remove all patches using \\`quilt pop -a' from the quilt version used to create this working tree, or remove the %s directory and apply the patches from scratch.\
Display name '%s' contains unpaired parentheses
Display name '%s' contains invalid characters
Display name '%s' contains non-printable or 8-bit characters
Delivery address '%s' is invalid
USAGE: %s {-s|-u} section file [< replacement]
