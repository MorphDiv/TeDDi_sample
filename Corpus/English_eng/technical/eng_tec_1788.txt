Entering Text
How to enter direct text strings that do not get interpreted?
*
(a letter with a superscripted asterisk), the asterisk will be interpreted as a multiplication operator.
Enclose the direct text within double quotes or add spaceholders.
Examples:
An imported MathType formula contains the following string
W rSup { size 8{*} }
If you have set up Math to convert imported MathType formulae (in Tools - Options - Load/Save - Microsoft Office), you will see the formula with a placeholder instead of the asterisk.
Change {*} to {} * {} as in the following formula:
W rSup { size 8{} * {} }
You can also use W^ &quot; * &quot; to enter the character as direct text.
Some formulae start with an = sign.
Use &quot; = &quot; to enter that character as direct text.
