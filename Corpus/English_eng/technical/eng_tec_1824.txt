Dim sReturn As String
Dim sListArray(10) as String
Dim siStep as Single
For siStep = 0 to 10 REM Fill array with test data
sListArray(siStep) = chr(siStep + 65)
msgbox sListArray(siStep)
next siStep
sReturn = LinSearch(sListArray(), &quot; B &quot; )
Print sReturn
end sub
Function LinSearch( sList(), sItem As String ) as integer
dim iCount as Integer
REM LinSearch searches a TextArray:sList() for a TextEntry:
REM Returns the index of the entry or 0 ( Null)
for iCount=1 to Ubound( sList() )
if sList( iCount ) = sItem then
Exit for REM sItem found
end if
next iCount
if iCount = Ubound( sList() ) then iCount = 0
LinSearch = iCount
end function
