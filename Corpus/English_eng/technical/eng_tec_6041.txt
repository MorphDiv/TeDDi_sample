KArmReminder
(c) 2006
Someone, probably you, has called karm.
KArm has been renamed to KTimeTracker. This makes it easier to recognize. Compatibility advice: Do not give ktimetracker files to karm users. Using karm files with ktimetracker is possible.
Please learn to call ktimetracker as this reminder may be removed in the future.
