This function terminates encryption specified by the encryption descriptor (td).
It clears all buffers, but does not close the module.
You need to call mcrypt_module_close() yourself. (But PHP does this for you at the end of the script.
Returns FALSE on error, or TRUE on success.
See for an example mcrypt_module_open() and the entry on mcrypt_generic_init().
