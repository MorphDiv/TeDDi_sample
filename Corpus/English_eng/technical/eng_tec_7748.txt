EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
VELCADE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Velcade?
Velcade is a powder that is made up into a solution for injection.
It contains the active substance bortezomib.
What is Velcade used for?
Velcade is an anticancer medicine.
It is used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells in the bone marrow.
Velcade is used in the following groups:  patients who have not been treated before and who are not suitable for high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant.
In these patients, Velcade is used in combination with melphalan and prednisone (other medicines for multiple myeloma);  patients whose disease is progressive (getting worse) and who have failed to respond to at least one other treatment and have already had, or cannot undergo, a bone marrow transplant.
Velcade is used on its own in these patients.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Velcade used?
Treatment with Velcade should only be started and given under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the use of cancer chemotherapy.
The recommended starting dose is 1.3 mg per square metre body surface area (calculated using the patient ’ s height and weight).
The solution is given as a three- to five-second injection through a catheter (a thin sterile tube) into a vein.
When used in combination with melphalan and prednisone, Velcade is given twice a week on weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 of a six-week treatment cycle.
This cycle is repeated three more times, followed by five cycles of once-weekly injections.
When used on its own, Velcade is given twice a week on weeks 1 and 2 of a three-week treatment cycle.
Patients who respond fully to treatment should receive two more cycles, but patients who only partially respond to treatment should receive up to eight cycles.
If a patient develops severe side effects after a treatment cycle, the treatment must be suspended and the dose adjusted.
How does Velcade work?
The active substance in Velcade, bortezomib, is a proteasome inhibitor.
It blocks the proteasome, which is a system within the cells that breaks down proteins when they are no longer needed.

How has Velcade been studied?
The effectiveness of Velcade has been studied in four main studies.
The first study involved 682 patients who had not been treated before and were not suitable for high- dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant.
The study compared the effects of adding Velcade to melphalan and prednisone with those of melphalan and prednisone alone.
The other three studies looked at patients who had received at least one previous treatment and whose disease was getting worse during their most recent treatment.
In one study, the effectiveness of Velcade was compared with that of high-dose dexamethasone (another medicine for multiple myeloma) in 669 patients.
In the other two studies, including a total of 256 patients, Velcade was not compared with any other treatments.
The main measures of effectiveness were the number of patients who responded to treatment and the time taken for the disease to get worse.
What benefit has Velcade shown during the studies?
In patients who had not been treated before, adding Velcade to melphalan and prednisone increased the time until the disease got worse: it took an average of 20.7 months in patients receiving Velcade and 15.0 months in those receiving only melphalan and prednisone.
In patients who had been treated before, the time taken for the disease to get worse was, on average, 6.2 months with Velcade and 3.5 months with dexamethasone in the comparative study.
In the other two studies, around 34% of the patients responded partially or completely to treatment with Velcade.
What is the risk associated with Velcade?
The most common side effects with Velcade (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are herpes zoster (shingles), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), neutropenia (too few of the white blood cells that fight infection), reduced appetite, peripheral neuropathy with paraesthesia (tingling or numbness and pins and needles), headache, dyspnoea (breathlessness), nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, rash, myalgia (muscle pain), fatigue (tiredness) and pyrexia (fever).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Velcade, see the Package Leaflet.
Velcade should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bortezomib, boron or to any of the other ingredients.
It must not be given to patients with severe liver disease, ‘ acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease’ (a severe lung problem) or pericardial disease (disease affecting the sac that surrounds the heart).
Why has Velcade been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Velcade’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
The Committee recommended that Velcade be given marketing authorisation.
Velcade has been authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’, because, for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on the medicine.
Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary.
What information is still awaited for Velcade?
The company that makes Velcade will carry out further studies looking in particular at the distribution of Velcade in the body (especially after repeated doses), and at the risk of patients developing amyloidosis (a build-up of a type of protein called amyloid in the body) or of amyloidosis getting worse.
Other information about Velcade:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Velcade on 26 April 2004.
The marketing authorisation holder is Janssen-Cilag International NV.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 26 April 2009.
