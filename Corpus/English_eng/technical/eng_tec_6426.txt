The interface
Image Operations
Gwenview has a few features which are available in both Browse, View, and Full Screen view. Gwenview has the capability to do basic alteration of your images.
Rotate: A rotate operation will rotate the image either to the left or to the right, depending on whether you do Ctrl; R Edit Rotate Right or Ctrl; L Edit
Edit Mirror: This operation will reflect the image along the vertical axis, as if you were seeing it in a mirror.
Edit Flip: This operation will reflect the image upside-down (a reflection along the horizontal axis)
Edit Resize: This operation will allow you to shrink or expand the image. Note that if you increase the size of an image, it may appear blurry and/ or pixelated.
Edit Crop: This operation lets you discard parts of the image you do n't want.
Browse Mode
When in Browse Mode, you can easily navigate through your files and folders. The preview window shows thumbnails of the images in the current folder, as well as subfolders.
Browse Mode Screenshot
Moving the mouse over an image shows buttons to rotate the image as well as a button to enter Fullscreen Mode. Clicking on an image takes you into View Mode. The sidebar on the right does not appear by default, but its appearance can be toggled using F11 View or using the Show/ Hide Sidebar button. Note that the option will appear as either Show Sidebar or Hide Sidebar, depending on whether the sidebar is currently shown. The slider at the bottom right allows you to change the size of the image thumbnails. You can also filter the images by filename using the box on the lower left. The toolbar (left) appears in both Browse mode as well as View mode and contains the most commonly used actions.
Browse: Switches to Browse Mode.
View: Switches to View Mode.
Full Screen: Switches to Full Screen Mode.
Go to Previous Image: Clicking this icon will go to the previous image in the folder.
Go to Next Image: Clicking this button will go to the next image in the folder.
Rotate Left/ Right: Same as discussed in Image Operations
Show Sidebar: Shows the sidebar (right) which displays information about the current image.
View Mode
View Mode displays one image at a time. At the bottom, there is the Thumbnail Bar, which allows you to scroll through the images in the current folder. The Thumbnail Bar can be minimized by clicking on the Thumbnail Bar button. Clicking again will restore it.
View Mode Screenshot
The slider at the bottom right controls the zoom of the image. The Zoom to Fit button and the Actual Size button are next to the zoom slider and are two preset zoom levels. The Zoom to Fit button zooms the current image to fit the size of the window, and the Actual Size button zooms the image to the actual pixel size.
You can start directly in View mode by starting & kappname; from a context menu like Open With in another program or by launching it from the command line with an image as an argument.
Full Screen Mode
The Full Screen Mode shows a slideshow of your images. Access Full Screen Mode by clicking on the button that appears when you move the mouse over the thumbnails in Browse Mode, by pressing the Full Screen button on the taskbar, or by Ctrl; Shift; F View.
Full Screen Mode Screenshot
The top bar will hide itself automatically; to show it simply move the mouse to the top of the screen. If the mouse cursor is over the top bar, it will not autohide. Most of the buttons on the bar are the same as the ones on the toolbar in Browse or View Modes, except for the Exit Full Screen Mode button which returns you to the & kappname; window, the Start/ Stop Slideshow button, and the Configure Full Screen Mode button which shows a small settings dialog that allows you to easily and quickly configure the slideshow. The slideshow controls there are:
The Interval slider controls how long & kappname; will show an image before it move to the next one.
If the Loop checkbox is checked, when the end of the slideshow is reached, it will continue from the beginning instead of stopping.
If the Random checkbox is checked, instead of progressing through the folder alphabetically, images will be shown in random order.
Also in the top bar is an area that shows you the other images in the current folder. Clicking on one will display it.
Browse and View modes
By default, & kappname; opens in Browse mode.
From the Browse mode, unchecking Ctrl; Return View Browse will put you in View mode, where the image takes all the space of the window.
