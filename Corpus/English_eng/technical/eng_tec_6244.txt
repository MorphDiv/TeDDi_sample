Using & xsldbg;
xsldbg command arguments
On systems with readline library available you can use the back/ forward keys to navigate the history of entered commands. On all systems the last entered command can be repeated by just pressing the & lt; ENTERgt; key.
If your operating system supports it file names will be expanded.
Several commands take more that one argument. Quotes may be used to lead to complex expressions being treated as one argument. eg break & quot; * | @quot; would allow you to see a breakpoint on the template with the name & quot; * | @quot;
