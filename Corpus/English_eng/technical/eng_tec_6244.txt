If set, mouse wheel goes to previous or next unit, otherwise it scrolls text
When this option is enabled, the mouse wheel is used to go to the previous or next translation unit (without modifier keys). Modifier keys can be used to change this behavior. Use: Shift to scroll within the text of the current unit, Ctrl+Shift to go to previous or next non-ready unit, Ctrl to go to previous or next non-ready not empty unit, Alt to go to previous or next untranslated unit. When the option is disabled, the mouse wheel scrolls within the text of the current translation unit.

Project's glossary
Target language of the project.
This is main setting. Set this to path of a folder with translation files for your project (or a subproject for your target language).
Root folder:
Glossary:
Project ID is used to differentiate translation memories of absolutely different projects and languages. For example, if you have several projects for translating KDE applications (e. g. they are in different repositories), use same ID for all of them.
ID:
Mailing list:
Syntax
Usually '', but may also be '_ 'for GTK apps.
Markup:
Regular expression of markup. It is used for translation memory matching and for'Insert tag 'feature. A default value (suitable for XML-based texts) is: (< [^ > ]+ > )+| ([A-Za-z_:][A-Za-z0-9_\\.:-]*;)+ It is only used for gettext PO files, as XLIFF format has its own way of specifying where markup is.
Paths
Template files folder:
Usually your translation project will be a subproject of a project for translating same texts into multiple languages. Set this to path of a folder containing empty translation files (i. e. files without translation into any language) shared among all subprojects.
Branch folder:
This setting is for Sync Mode. Sync Mode may be used to make changes to translation for two branches simultaneously. Set this to path that corresponds to root folder of the branch project, and Secondary Sync view will automatically open files from branch. Then, each time you make changes in files of your main branch, they will automatically be replicated to the branch (of course, if it contains the same English string). See documentation for more details.
Alternate translations folder:
Set this to path of a folder with structure similar to Root Folder. On each translation file open, a corresponding file in Alternate translations directory will be looked up and, if it is found, it will be used for Alternate Translations view. You will likely want to use translations of another target language (i. e. another subproject), which is close to yours. Also, you can use other subproject's translations either immediately, or have them pretranslated to your language by machine. See documentation for more details.
To facilitate KDE translation, Lokalize can capture text from applications' user interfaces and search for translation files containing the text. When enabled, the capture can be initiated by middle mouse clicking on any non-editable GUI element (widget). After that, switch to the Lokalize window and choose the entry with this text. Even if several files contain the same string, the right one will be chosen in most cases. Remember that you need to have an up-to-date actual translation memory with all translation files indexed for this feature to work.

Alternate Translations
Sometimes, if original text is changed, its translation becomes deprecated and is either marked as needingnbsp; review (i. e. looses approval status), or (only in case of XLIFF file) moved to the alternatenbsp; translations section accompanying the unit. This toolview also shows the difference between new original string and the old one, so that you can easily see which changes should be applied to existing translation. Double-click any word in this toolview to insert it into translation. Drop translation file onto this toolview to use it as a source for alternate translations.
