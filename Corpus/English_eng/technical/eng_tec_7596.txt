4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS:
4.1 Target species
Dogs
4.2 Indications for use
Alleviation of inflammation and pain in both acute and chronic musculo-skeletal disorders.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in pregnant or lactating animals.
Do not use in animals suffering from gastrointestinal disorders such as irritation and haemorrhage, impaired hepatic, cardiac or renal function and haemorrhagic disorders, or where there is evidence of individual hypersensitivity to the product.
Do not use in dogs less than 6 weeks of age.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use
If side effects occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of the veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of increased renal toxicity.
2/ 34 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product product to animals
People with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Typical adverse drug reactions of NSAIDs such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, faecal occult blood and apathy have occasionally been reported.
These side effects occur generally within the first treatment week and are in most cases transient and disappear following termination of the treatment but in very rare cases may be serious or fatal.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation (see 4.3).
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Flexicam must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Pre- treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
To be administered mixed with food.
Initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight on the first day.
Treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration (24-hour intervals) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight.
Particular care should be taken with regard to the accuracy of dosing.
The suspension can be given using either the drop dispenser (for very small breeds) or the Flexicam measuring syringe provided in the package.
The dispenser provides 0.05 mg meloxicam per drop (ie. a dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight corresponds to 2 drops/ kg body weight).
The syringe fits onto the bottle and has a kg-body weight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose (ie.
0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight).
Thus for the first day, twice the maintenance volume will be required.
Shake well before use.
A clinical response is normally seen within 3- 4 days.
Treatment should be discontinued after 10 days at the latest if no clinical improvement is apparent.
Avoid introduction of contamination during use.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes) (if necessary)
In the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated.
3/ 34 4.11 Withdrawal periods
Not Applicable

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
ATCvet Code:
QM01AC06
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-exudative and antipyretic effects.
It reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue.
To a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation.
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that meloxicam inhibits cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) to a greater extent than cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption Meloxicam is completely absorbed following oral administration and maximal plasma concentrations are obtained after approximately 7.5 hours.
When the product is used according to the recommended dosage regime, steady state concentrations of meloxicam in plasma are reached on the second day of treatment.
Distribution There is a linear relationship between the dose of meloxicam administered and plasma concentration observed in the therapeutic dose range.
Approximately 97% of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins.
The volume of distribution is 0.31/ kg.
Metabolism Meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma and is also a major biliary excretion product whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound.
Meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol, an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 24 hours.
Approximately 75% of the administered dose of meloxicam is eliminated via faeces and the remainder via urine.

4.4 Special warnings for each target species
For post-operative pain relief in cats, safety has only been documented after thiopental/ halothane anaesthesia.
7/ 34 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
If side effects occur, treatment should be discontinued.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of increased renal toxicity.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Accidental self-injection may give rise to pain.
People with known hypersensitivity to meloxicam should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Typical adverse drug reactions of NSAIDs such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, faecal occult blood and apathy have occasionally been reported.
In dogs, these side effects occur generally within the first treatment week and are in most cases transient and disappear following termination of the treatment but in very rare cases may be serious or fatal.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation (see 4.3).
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Flexicam must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Concurrent administration of potential nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.
In animals at anaesthetic risk (e. g. aged animals) intravenous or subcutaneous fluid therapy during anaesthesia should be taken into consideration.
When anaesthesia and NSAID are concomitantly administered, a risk for renal function cannot be excluded.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Dogs:
Musculo-skeletal disorders:
Single subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight (i. e.
0.4 ml/ 10 kg body weight).
Flexicam 1.5 mg/ ml oral suspension may be used for continuation of treatment at a dosage of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight, 24 hours after administration of the injection.
Reduction of post-operative pain (over a period of 24 hours):

DOSAGE FOR EACH SPECIES, ROUTE AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
Initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight on the first day.
Treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration (at 24- hour intervals) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight.
Shake well before use.
To be administered mixed with food.
The suspension can be given using either the drop dispenser (for very small breeds) or the Flexicam measuring syringe provided in the package (see below).
The dispenser provides 0.05mg meloxicam per drop (i. e. a dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight corresponds to 2 drops/ kg body weight).
The syringe fits onto the bottle and has a kg- body weight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose (i. e.
0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight).
Thus for the first day, twice the maintenance volume will be required.
Dosing procedure using the measuring syringe:
A clinical response is normally seen within 3- 4 days.
Treatment should be discontinued after 10 days at the latest if no clinical improvement is apparent.
Avoid introduction of contamination during use.

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
If side effects occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of increased renal toxicity.
Other NSAIDS, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Flexicam must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDS or glucocorticosteroids.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
In the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated.
People with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDS should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show this package insert or the label to the physician.

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
If side effects occur, treatment should be discontinued.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of increased renal toxicity.
Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
