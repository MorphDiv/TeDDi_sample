Introduction
& kfind; is the & kde; file find utility.
Launching & kfind;
The Find Files tool is a useful method of searching for specific files on your computer, or for searching for files that match a pattern. An example of this could include searching for files of a particular type or with certain letters in the filename. You can load this utility by clicking on Find Files. This will launch & kfind;.
Finding Files
The Name/ Location Tab
When starting & kfind;, you will see a quite simple window. Type in the name of the file you are searching in the text box labeled Named:. Choose a folder where you want to search by typing it in the field Look in: or by clicking Browse... and press Enter or click Find. If Include subfolders is checked all subfolders starting from your chosen folder will be searched too. The results will be displayed in the box below.
You can use the following wildcards:
The Asterisk *
The asterisk stands for any number of missing characters (even zero), that means & eg; searching for marc* may find the files marc, marc. png and marc_must_not_read_this. kwd. mar*. kwd may find marketplace. kwd and marc_must_not_read_this. kwd.
The Question Mark?
In contrast to the asterisk, the question mark stands for exactly one character, so mar? will find marc, but marc? will not find anything, as our files are called marc and marc. png. You can put as many question marks in the term as you want, it will find exactly that number of characters.
Of course you can combine those two wildcard symbols in a search term.
The Contents Tab
File type
Here you can specify the type of file you are searching for.
Containing text
Type in the word or phrase the files you are searching for must contain. Note: If you do this in a large folder or checked Include subfolders in the Name/ Location tab, this may take a long time.
This option will not work for all files listed under File type. Only the following file types are supported:
Text files, & eg; source code and README files
& kword; & gt; = 1.2
& kpresenter; & gt; = 1.2
& kspread; & gt; = 1.2
OpenOffice. org Writer
OpenOffice. org Impress
OpenOffice. org Calc
Case sensitive
If you enable this option, & kfind; will only find files with the exact case matching, & eg; MARC will only match MARC, not Marc.
Regular expression
If you have installed the & kregexpeditor; tool from the kdeutils package, you will have this additional option. Enabling it will allow you to search for a regexp or regular expression. A regexp is a way to specify conditions for your search, and they can be very complex, and equally they can be very powerful. If you are unfamiliar with regular expressions, you can choose Edit Regular Expression to open & kregexpeditor;. This tool allows you to construct your set of conditions graphically, and then generates the expression for you.
& kregexpeditor; is a very useful tool, and can be used from within many & kde; applications other than & kfind;. You can find more information from within its own help file.
The Properties Tab
Here you can refine your search. These are the special refinements you can choose:
Find all files created or modified
Here you can either enter two dates, between which the files were created or modified, or specify a time period.
File size is
Here you can specify if the file has to be at least or as most as big as the size you entered in the following box.
Files owned by user, Files owned by group
Here you can specify user and group names.
