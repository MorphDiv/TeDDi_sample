Check this option if the application you want to run is a text mode application. The application will then be run in a terminal emulator window.

Check this option if you want to run the application with a different user id. Every process has a user id associated with it. This id code determines file access and other permissions. The password of the user is required to do this.
Run as a different & user

Run %1
Select whether realtime scheduling should be enabled for the application. The scheduler governs which process will run and which will have to wait. Two schedulers are available: Normal: This is the standard, timesharing scheduler. It will divide fairly the available processing time between all processes. Realtime: This scheduler will run your application uninterrupted until it gives up the processor. This can be dangerous. An application that does not give up the processor might hang the system. You need root's password to use the scheduler.
Run with realtime & scheduling
The priority that the command will be run with can be set here. From left to right, it goes from low to high. The center position is the default value. For priorities higher than the default, you will need to provide the root password.
& Priority:
Check this option if you want to run the application with a different priority. A higher priority tells the operating system to give more processing time to your application.
