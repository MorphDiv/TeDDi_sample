Authentication is required to run the GParted Partition Editor
GParted is a free partition editor for graphically managing your disk partitions.
With GParted you can resize, copy, label, and move partitions without data loss. These actions enable you to grow or shrink your C: drive, create space for new operating systems, or attempt data rescue from lost partitions.
GParted works with many file systems including: btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, fat16, fat32, hfs, hfs+, linux-swap, lvm2 pv, nilfs2, ntfs, reiserfs, reiser4, ufs, and xfs.

If you want more partitions you should first create an extended partition. Such a partition can contain other partitions. Because an extended partition is also a primary partition it might be necessary to remove a primary partition first.
Moving a partition might cause your operating system to fail to boot
You have queued an operation to move the start sector of partition %1.
Failure to boot is most likely to occur if you move the GNU/Linux partition containing /boot, or if you move the Windows system partition C:.
You can learn how to repair the boot configuration in the GParted FAQ.
Moving a partition might take a very long time to apply.
You have pasted into an existing partition
The data in %1 will be lost if you apply this operation.
Unable to delete %1!
Please unmount any logical partitions having a number higher than %1
Are you sure you want to delete %1?
After deletion this partition is no longer available for copying.
Delete %1 (%2, %3)
Cannot format this file system to %1
A %1 file system requires a partition of at least %2.
A partition with a %1 file system has a maximum size of %2.
The partition could not be unmounted from the following mount points:
Most likely other partitions are also mounted on these mount points. You are advised to unmount them manually.
The swapon action cannot be performed if an operation is pending for the partition.
Use the Edit menu to undo, clear, or apply operations before using swapon with this partition.
The activate Volume Group action cannot be performed if an operation is pending for the partition.
Use the Edit menu to undo, clear, or apply operations before using activate Volume Group with this partition.

A new partition table cannot be created when there are active partitions.
Active partitions are those that are in use, such as a mounted file system, or enabled swap space.
Use Partition menu options, such as unmount or swapoff, to deactivate all partitions on this device before creating a new partition table.
A new partition table cannot be created when there are pending operations.
Use the Edit menu to either clear or apply all operations before creating a new partition table.
Error while creating partition table
Command gpart was not found
This feature uses gpart. Please install gpart and try again.
A full disk scan is needed to find file systems.
The scan might take a very long time.
After the scan you can mount any discovered file systems and copy the data to other media.
Do you want to continue?

The disk scan by gpart did not find any recognizable file systems on this disk.
Are you sure you want to apply the pending operations?
Editing partitions has the potential to cause LOSS of DATA.
You are advised to backup your data before proceeding.
Apply operations to device
You are deleting non-empty LVM2 Physical Volume %1
You are formatting over non-empty LVM2 Physical Volume %1
You are pasting over non-empty LVM2 Physical Volume %1
Deleting or overwriting the Physical Volume is irrecoverable and will destroy or damage the Volume Group.
To avoid destroying or damaging the Volume Group, you are advised to cancel and use external LVM commands to free the Physical Volume before attempting this operation.
Do you want to continue to forcibly delete the Physical Volume?
Changing the UUID might invalidate the Windows Product Activation (WPA) key
On FAT and NTFS file systems, the Volume Serial Number is used as the UUID. Changing the Volume Serial Number on the Windows system partition, normally C:, might invalidate the WPA key. An invalid WPA key will prevent login until you reactivate Windows.
Changing the UUID on external storage media and non-system partitions is usually safe, but guarantees cannot be given.

The LVM2 Physical Volume can not currently be resized because it is a member of an exported Volume Group.
Root privileges are required for running GParted
Since GParted is a powerful tool capable of destroying partition tables and vast amounts of data, only root may run it.
In an attempt to avoid invalidating the WPA key, on NTFS file systems only half of the UUID is set to a new random value.
