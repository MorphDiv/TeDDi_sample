Film
Overview
Applying example for the Film filter
Original image
Filter
Film filter lets you merge several pictures into a photographic film drawing.
This filter does not invert colors, so it does not imitate negative film like the ones used to produce prints. Instead you should think of the result as an imitation of slide film or cinema film.
Accessing this Filter
You can find this filter through
Options
Selection

Fit height to images
Applies the height of original pictures to the resulting one.
Height
This option lets you define the height of the resulting picture. If originals have different sizes, they will be scaled to this size.
Color
By clicking on the color dwell you can define the color of the film (around and between pictures).
Numbering
Start index
Defines the beginning number which will be used for the images.
Font
Defines the font of digits.
By clicking on the color dwell, you can define the font color of digits.
At top
At bottom
Defines the position of the number.
Image Selection
Available images
Shows the pictures which can be used for merging. The pictures are the ones already opened in GIMP.
On film
Shows the pictures chosen to be merged.
Add
This button allows the user to put an available image in the

Advanced

Image height
Defines the height of each pictures in the resulting image.
Image spacing
Defines the space between the pictures as they will be inserted in the future image.
Hole offset
Defines the hole position from image border.
Hole width
Defines the width of the holes in the resulting image.
Hole height
Defines the height of the holes in the resulting image.
Hole spacing
Defines the space between holes
Number height
Defines the height of the index number, proportionally to the height of the picture.

Depth Merge
Depth Merge is a Combine Filter which is useful to combine two different pictures or layers. You can decide which part of every image or layer will stay visible.
Filter example
Original
Filter applied
Every image is associated with a map which works as a mask. Simply create this map as a grayscale gradient: when applied onto the image, dark areas of the mask will show the underlying image and bright areas will mask the image.
To work with this filter, images and maps must have the same size. All images to be selected must be present on screen.
You can also use this filter on an image with several layers. All layers will appear in the drop-down lists used to select images. These layers must have the same size.
You can find this filter through

Source 1
Source 2
Defines the source images to use for the blending.
Depth map
Define the picture to use as transformation maps for the sources.
Overlap
Creates soft transitions between images.
Offset
This option shifts the merging limit, giving more or less importance to an image against the other.
Scale 1
Scale 2
Same as above for Offset, but more sensitive and applied to each map separately. When you scale to a lower value, it will affect the map image's value, making it darker. So, black is more dominant in the merge and you will see more of the image.
Using example
Maps are grayscale gradients created with the
Source images and their maps
Source image 1
Source image 2
Map 1
Map 2
You can understand what's going on. Image-1 is treated by map-1: the red square is masked and the yellow square remains visible. Image-2 is treated by map-2: the red circle is masked and the green circle remains visible. In total, the green circle and the yellow square stay visible.
