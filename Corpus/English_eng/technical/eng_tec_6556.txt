Variables
To assign a value to a variable use the = symbol or choose the variable to assign to with the
x=5
value=82
Variables can be used in any equation and are substituted for their assigned value. Variables can be inserted using the
6x+3
xy−3x+7y−21
The following variables are always defined.
ans
Result of previous calculation
e
Euler's Number
π
Pi
rand
Random value in the range [0,1] (changes on each read)
Trigonometry
Trigonometry can be performed using the sin, cos, and tan
sin 45
The angle units used can be changed from the
Hyperbolic functions are available by adding "h" to the end of a function.
sinh 0.34
Inverse functions are entered either using the inverse symbol ⁻¹ (
sin⁻¹ 0.5
asin 0.5

Superscript and Subscript
Some equations may require numbers to be entered in superscript or subscript form. e.g.
x³+2x²−5
To enter superscript numbers with the mouse select the number mode using the the
To enter superscript numbers with the keyboard hold down
The number mode returns to normal when entering the next non-number character (e.g. +).
Scientific Notation
To enter numbers in scientific format use the

The inverse of a number can be entered using the inverse symbol ⁻¹ (
3⁻¹
Powers can also be calculated using the ^ symbol. This allows the power to be an equation.
5^(6−2)
If your keyboard does not have a
Square roots can be calculated using the symbol (
√2
n-th roots can be calculated by putting a
₃√2
Percentages
Percentages are calculated using the % symbol.
When added or subtracted the percentage symbol resolves to one percent of the value being added or subtracted from. The following equation calculates the price of a $140 item with 15% tax (140 + (15÷100)×140).
140+15%
In all other cases the percentage symbol resolves to a fraction out of 100. The following equation calculates one quarter of 80 apples ((25÷100)×80).
25%×80

Financial Functions
When in financial mode the following buttons are available.
Ctrm
Calculate the number of compounding periods necessary to increase an investment of present value to a future value, at a fixed interest rate per compounding period.
Ddb
Calculate the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified period of time, using the double-declining balance method.
Fv
Calculate the future value of an investment based on a series of equal payments at a periodic interest rate over the number of payment periods in the term.
Gpm
Calculate the resale price of a product, based on the product cost and the wanted gross profit margin.
Pmt
Calculate the amount of the periodic payment of a loan, where payments are made at the end of each payment period.
Pv
Calculate the present value of an investment based on a series of equal payments discounted at a periodic interest rate over the number of payment periods in the term.
Rate
Calculate the periodic interest necessary to increase an investment to a future value, over the number of compounding periods.
Sln
Calculate the straight-line depreciation of an asset for one period. The straight-line method of depreciation divides the depreciable cost evenly over the useful life of an asset. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Syd
Calculate the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified period of time, using the Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits method. This method of depreciation accelerates the rate of depreciation, so that more depreciation expense occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The useful life is the number of periods, typically years, over which an asset is depreciated.
Term
Calculate the number of payment periods that are necessary during the term of an ordinary annuity, to accumulate a future value, at a periodic interest rate.
