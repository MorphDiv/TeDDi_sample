Plugins
Automatic orientation
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation.
The color that is used to fill the area behind the image. If the use-background-color key is not set, the color is determined by the active GTK+ theme instead.
Interpolate Image
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom-out. This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non-interpolated images.
Extrapolate Image
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom-in. This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non-extrapolated images.
Transparency indicator
Determines how transparency should be indicated. Valid values are CHECK_PATTERN, COLOR and NONE. If COLOR is chosen, then the trans-color key determines the color value used.
Scroll wheel zoom
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming.
Zoom multiplier
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming. This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event. For example, 0.05 results in a 5% zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100% zoom increment.
Transparency color
If the transparency key has the value COLOR, then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency.
Use a custom background color
If this is active, the color set by the background-color key will be used to fill the area behind the image. If it is not set, the current GTK+ theme will determine the fill color.
Loop through the image sequence
Whether the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop.
Allow zoom greater than 100% initially
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially.
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically. Zero disables the automatic browsing.
Show/Hide the window toolbar.
Show/Hide the window statusbar.
Show/Hide the image gallery pane.
Image gallery pane position. Set to 0 for bottom; 1 for left; 2 for top; 3 for right.
Whether the image gallery pane should be resizable.
Show/Hide the window side pane.
Show/Hide the image gallery pane scroll buttons.
Close main window without asking to save changes.
Trash images without asking
If activated, Eye of GNOME won't ask for confirmation when moving images to the trash. It will still ask if any of the files cannot be moved to the trash and would be deleted instead.
Whether the file chooser should show the user's pictures folder if no images are loaded.
If activated and no image is loaded in the active window, the file chooser will display the user's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories. If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up, it will show the current working directory.
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page.
If activated, the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog. This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens, e.g. as used by netbooks. If disabled, the widget will be embedded on the "Metadata" page.
External program to use for editing images
The desktop file name (including the ".desktop") of the application to use for editing images (when the "Edit Image" toolbar button is clicked). Set to the empty string to disable this feature.
