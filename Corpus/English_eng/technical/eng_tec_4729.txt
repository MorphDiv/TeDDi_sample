(PHP 3 = 3.0.8, PHP 4)
Sets the value of quick_print within the UCD SNMP library.
When this is set (1), the SNMP library will return'quick printed 'values.
This means that just the value will be printed.
When quick_print is not enabled (default) the UCD SNMP library prints extra information including the type of the value (i.e.
IpAddress or OID).
Additionally, if quick_print is not enabled, the library prints additional hex values for all strings of three characters or less.
Setting quick_print is often used when using the information returned rather then displaying it.
snmp_set_quick_print( 0); $a = snmpget("127.0.0.1", "public", ".1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9.1"); echo "$a BR \n"; snmp_set_quick_print(1); $a = snmpget("127.0.0.1", "public", ".1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9.1"); echo "$a BR \n";
The first value printed might be: 'Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00', whereas with quick_print enabled, just '0:00:00.00' would be printed.
By default the UCD SNMP library returns verbose values, quick_print is used to return only the value.
Currently strings are still returned with extra quotes, this will be corrected in a later release.
snmp_set_quick_print() is only available when using the UCD SNMP library.
This function is not available when using the Windows SNMP library.
