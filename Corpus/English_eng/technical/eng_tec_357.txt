Glossary of Internet Terms
If you are a newcomer to the Internet, you will be confronted with unfamiliar terms: browser, bookmark, e-mail, homepage, search engine, and many others.
To make your first steps easier, this glossary explains some of the more important terminology you may find in the Internet, intranet, mail and news.
Frames
HTML
pages. $[officename] uses floating frames into which you can place objects such as graphics, movie files and sound.
The context menu of a frame shows the options for restoring or editing frame contents.
Some of these commands are also listed in
Edit - Object
when the frame is selected.
FTP
HTTP
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) provides the connection set-up and data transfer between WWW servers and clients.
HTML; definition
HTML
SGML
and integrates text, graphics, videos and sound.
Text
and give it the file name extension .HTML.
Be sure there are no umlauts or other special characters of the extended character set.
If you want to re-open this file in $[officename] and edit the HTML code, you must load it with the file type
Text
and not with the file type
Web pages
.
There are several references in the Internet providing an introduction to the HTML language.
HTTP
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a method of transmission of WWW documents between WWW servers (hosts) and browsers (clients).
hyperlinks; definition
Hyperlink
Hyperlinks are cross-references, highlighted in text in various colours and activated by mouse-click.
With the aid of hyperlinks, readers can jump to specific information within a document as well as to related information in other documents.
In $[officename] you can assign hyperlinks to text as well as to graphics and text frames (see the Hyperlink Dialogue Box icon on the Standard bar).
ImageMap; definition
ImageMap
URL
), which is linked with the area.
The reference areas, along with the linked URLs and corresponding text displayed when resting the mouse pointer on these areas, are defined in the
ImageMap Editor
.
HTML
page on the Internet.
In server evaluation, clicking an ImageMap sends the relative coordinates of the cursor within the image to the server, and a dedicated program on the server responds.
In the client evaluation, clicking a defined hotspot of the ImageMap activates the URL, as if it were a normal text link.
The URL appears below the mouse pointer when passing across the ImageMap.
As ImageMaps can be used in different ways, they can be stored in different formats.
ImageMap Formats
ImageMaps are basically divided between those that are analysed on the server (i. e. your Internet provider) and those analysed on the web browser of the reader's computer.
Server Side ImageMap
Server Side ImageMaps
Server Side ImageMaps appear for the reader as a picture or frame on the page.
Click on the ImageMap with the mouse, and the coordinates of the relative position are sent to the server.
Aided by an extra program, the server then determines the next step to take.
There are several incompatible methods to define this process, the two most common being:
W3C (CERN) HTTP Server (Format type:
MAP - CERN)
NCSA HTTP Server (Format type:
MAP - NCSA)
File type
list box in the
Save As
dialogue box in the
ImageMap Editor
.
Separate Map Files are created which you must upload to the server.
You will need to ask your provider or network administrator which type of ImageMaps are supported by the server and how to access the evaluation program.
Client Side ImageMap
Client Side ImageMap
URL
when the mouse passes over the area.
The ImageMap is stored in a layer below the picture and contains information about the referenced regions.
The only disadvantage of Client Side ImageMaps is that older Web browsers cannot read them; a disadvantage that will, however, resolve itself in time.
SIP - StarView ImageMap
.
This saves the ImageMap directly in a format which can be applied to every active picture or frame in your document.
However, if you just want to use the ImageMap on the current picture or text frame, you do not have to save it in any special format.
After defining the regions, simply click
Apply
.
Nothing more is necessary.
Client Side ImageMaps saved in
HTML
format are inserted directly into the page in HTML code.
Java; definition
Java
The Java programming language is a platform independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
(http://www.sun.com) that is especially suited for use in the Internet.
Web pages and applications programmed with Java class files can be used on all modern operating systems.
Programs using Java programming language are usually developed in a Java development environment and then compiled to a &quot; byte code &quot; .
plug-ins; definition
Plug-In
Extensions providing additional functionality in Web browsers are referred to as Plug-Ins.
A Plug-In is a term used in various contexts:
Plug-Ins in $[officename]
Formatting
Bar changes after certain operations.
For example, if you insert a formula into your text document, you will see icons for editing the formula, in fact the same ones you see in formula documents.
In this sense, we refer to the formula as a plug-in within the text document.
Using Plug-Ins to extend your programs
Plug-ins, generally speaking, are software additions to particular applications which provide enhanced functionality.
Often import and export filters for various file formats are stored as plug-ins in a plug-in directory.
Netscape web browser extensions produced by Netscape Communication Corporation are also called plug-ins.
These are external programs mainly taken from the multimedia field and which communicate with the browser through standardised interfaces.
These plug-ins can be linked to $[officename] documents.
Any Netscape plug-ins (32 bit) installed on your system are automatically recognised by $[officename].
Proxy
A proxy is a computer in the network acting as a kind of clipboard for data transfer.
Whenever you access the Internet from a company network and request a Web page that has already been read by a colleague, the proxy will be able to display the page much quicker, as long as it's still in the memory.
All that needs to be checked in this case is that the page stored in the proxy is the latest version.
If this is the case, the page won't have to be downloaded from the much slower Internet but can be loaded directly from the proxy.
SGML; definition
SGML
SGML stands for &quot; Standard Generalized Markup Language &quot; .
SGML is based on the idea that documents have structural and other semantic elements that can be described without reference to how such elements should be displayed.
The actual display of such a document may vary, depending on the output medium and style preferences.
In structured texts, SGML not only defines structures (in the DTD = Document Type Definition) but also ensures they are consistently used.
HTML
is a specialised application of SGML.
This means that most Web browsers support only a limited range of SGML standards and that almost all SGML-enabled systems can produce attractive HTML pages.
search engines; definition
Search Engines
A search engine is a service in the Internet based on a software program used to explore a vast amount of information using key words.
tags; definition
Tags
HTML
pages contain certain structural and formatting instructions called tags.
Tags are code words enclosed by angle brackets in the document description language HTML.
Many tags contain text or hyperlink references between the opening and closing angle brackets.
For example, titles are marked by the tags < h1 > at the beginning and < /h1 > at the end of the title.
Some tags only appear on their own such as
URL; definition
URL
The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) displays the address of a document or a server in the Internet.
The general structure of a URL varies according to type and is generally in the form Service://Hostname:Port/Path/Page#Mark although not all elements are always required.
A URL can be an FTP address, a WWW (HTTP) address, a file address or an e-mail address.
