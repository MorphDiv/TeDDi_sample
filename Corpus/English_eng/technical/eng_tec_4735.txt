Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
After the socket socket has been created using socket_create(), bound to a name with socket_bind(), and told to listen for connections with socket_listen(), this function will accept incoming connections on that socket.
Once a successful connection is made, a new socket resource is returned, which may be used for communication.
If there are multiple connections queued on the socket, the first will be used.
If there are no pending connections, socket_accept() will block until a connection becomes present.
If socket has been made non-blocking using socket_set_blocking() or socket_set_nonblock(), FALSE will be returned.
The socket resource returned by socket_accept() may not be used to accept new connections.
The original listening socket socket, however, remains open and may be reused.
Returns a new socket resource on success, or FALSE on error.
The actual error code can be retrieved by calling socket_last_error().
This error code may be passed to socket_strerror() to get a textual explanation of the error.
See also socket_bind(), socket_connect(), socket_listen(), socket_create(), and socket_strerror().
