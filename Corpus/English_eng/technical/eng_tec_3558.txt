ldap_explode_dn() function is used to split the DN returned by ldap_get_dn() and breaks it up into its component parts.
Each part is known as Relative Distinguished Name, or RDN. ldap_explode_dn() returns an array of all those components. with_attrib is used to request if the RDNs are returned with only values or their attributes as well.
To get RDNs with the attributes (i.e. in attribute=value format) set with_attrib to 0 and to get only values set it to 1.
