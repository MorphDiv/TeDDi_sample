Introduction
Gametype:
Logic, Board
Number of possible players:
One
& kappname; is a logic-based symbol placement puzzle.
The player has to fill a grid so that each column, row as well as each square block on the game field contains only one instance of each symbol.
Depending on the preferences and the difficulty level some games start with a partially completed game field, while the others start with a blank one.
There are hundreds of different variations of sudoku in existence. The most common variant of the game has a 9x9 squares grid and uses Arabic numerals for symbols. As an extra constraint, the grid is divided into 9 sectors of 3x3 squares. The problem is â€“ each symbol can only be used once per row, column and sector.
Note:
It takes a lot of time and concentration to complete each game. However, solving sudoku puzzles helps to increase the overall brain activity and therefore is highly recommended.
How to Play
Objective:
Fill the grid so that each column, row as well as each square sector on the game field contains only one instance of each symbol.
At the game start you are prompted to choose which game type you are interested in.
The game experience may change slightly depending on the game type you choose.
Take a look at left hand side of the game field. There is a selection list which contains all the symbols available for you to use in the current game.
The set of symbols varies depending on the game type you choose.
First, note the boundaries of the game field. The thick black lines outline the sectors. Every one of this sectors has to be completed using the symbols available, in such a way that each symbol is used within the sector area once and only once.
Now you can start entering the symbols into the vacant squares on the game field. You can do that by selecting the symbol you wish to enter from the selection list on the left, and then using your mouse to click on the vacant square on the game field.
Notice that the squares change color while you hover your mouse over them. It is done to help you keep up with the rules of & kappname;. Use the vertical and horizontal lines to check if the symbol, you are about to enter into the vacant spot, is already in use anywhere in the vertical or horizontal line that square is a part of. The coloring also highlights the sector which, if you remember, must also contain only one instance of each symbol.
Keep entering the symbols in accordance with the rules until the whole game field is filled up. At this point the application will check if all the entries are valid and either correct you, or except the solution.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
General Game Rules
The rules of & kappname; are quite simple.
Depending on the size of the game board and the difficulty level chosen each individual & kappname; puzzle may take up to a few hours to solve.
Each square may hold one and only one symbol.
Each horizontal row (as defined by the game board) can contain each symbol exactly once.
Each vertical row (as defined by the game board) can contain each symbol exactly once.
Each subgrid or section (as defined by the game board) can contain each symbol exactly once
Knowledge of mathematics, or language is not required to solve & kappname; puzzles.
Depending on the difficulty chosen the puzzles may appear partially solved. In such case the symbols already on the game board cannot be changed.
You can only modify the symbols you have previously entered.
& kappname; generated puzzles have one solution only.
Strategies and Tips
Take your time and do not rush. & kappname; is not a'quick 'game to play.
Pay attention to the row, column, and section colorings. They are here to aid you in the game.
Make sure that so duplicate symbol exists already in the row/ column/ section you are entering it to.
If in doubt, try to foresee if a square you are entering a symbol into maybe needed by some other symbol, which otherwise cannot go anywhere else due to the row/ column/ section rule violation.
If you are having troubles, try to retrace your steps and see exactly where you have made an error.
Even though & kappname; provides a'Hint 'option for you, try not to use it often. Remember solving the puzzle all by yourself enhances your brain activity, while using the'Hint' feature too often is cheating.
If you have much trouble solving a certain puzzle, and simply must use the'Hint 'feature, then maybe you should try to decrease the difficulty level, or try a simpler, more basic puzzle.
Some puzzle layouts feature very specific game board shapes. It is a good idea to have the coloring option enabled even if you consider yourself an experienced player.

Frequently asked questions
I want to change the way this game looks. Can I?
Sudoku games are traditionally played using square grid. Themes would not make much sense here. However, you can select the set of symbols used in game. To do so use Settings Configure & kappname;... on menubar.
I changed the symbols in the configuration dialog and now my entire game board is filled with question marks. What is the problem?
Each set contains a limited number of possible symbols. If you have chosen the set which has less symbols then your current game requires, the application will complain by displaying question marks. Change the set to fix the problem.
Can I use the keyboard to play this game?
Yes. In & kappname; keyboard play is always enabled. Please use cursor keys to move the selection, numeric characters to enter the symbols and & Shift; key to apply markers.
Where are the high scores?
& kappname; does not have this feature.
