Creating Reports

In %PRODUCTNAME Base, you have a choice to create a report either manually using drag-and-drop in the Report Builder window, or semi-automatic by following a series of dialogue boxes in the Report Wizard.
The following list gives you some information to decide which method to use for your data:
