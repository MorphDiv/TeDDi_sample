& skanlite; is an image scanning application that does nothing more than scan and save images.
& skanlite; is based on libksane, a KDE interface for SANE library to control flat scanners.

Introduction
& skanlite; is a simple image scanning application that does nothing more than scan and save images. & skanlite; can open a save dialog for every image scanned or save the images immediately in a specified directory with auto-generated names and format. The user can also choose to show the scanned image before saving.
& skanlite; can save images in the following formats:
jpeg, jpg
png
bmp
ppm
xbm
xpm
You can check the status of your scanner support from the SANE project website by entering the information on this search page: http: / /www. sane-project. org/ cgi-bin/ driver. pl.
Using & skanlite;
Scanner Selection
A default scanner can be specified on the command line of & skanlite; using skanlite -d [device name] in a terminal. If the selected scanner cannot be opened or if no default scanner is provided, a scanner selection dialog is opened.

The user can choose the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner. Pressing Cancel will cause & skanlite; to exit.
& skanlite; Main Window

In the main window, the user has two sets of scan options: Basic Options and Other Options. The Basic Options tab contains the most common parameters that the SANE scanner backends provide, while the Other Options tab contains all the other options. The options listed here depend on SANE support for your driver: libksane (which & skanlite; uses) should be able to display most of the types of parameters that SANE provides (analog gamma tables are not supported at this time).

The other options contains more detailed options of the backends. & skanlite; (libksane) does not have any special handling for these options.
Scanning
To scan an image, the user can start with a preview scan and then select the part of the scan area to do the final scan on. The preview scan is started by pressing the preview button.

When the preview is scanned the area for the final image can be selected.

To better select the image the user can zoom in, out, to the current selection or zoom to fit the whole preview to the window.

If Preview image before saving is selected in the settings, the scanned image is displayed in a preview window as you can see below on the screenshot. If Save is pressed, the image is saved and if Close is pressed the preview is discarded and you return to the main window.

By clicking the Settings button, the settings dialog is brought up before the main window. You can choose the most important settings here.
Here's a screenshot of & skanlite; settings dialog
& skanlite; settings dialog
Preview the image before saving
The user can chose to preview the image before saving. In this case the Preview the image before saving option can be left checked. If the user does not want to preview the image this option should then be unchecked.
Save Mode:
This setting allows you to choose how & skanlite; will save the images. If you choose Open the save dialog for every image then the save dialog will be opened for every scanned image. If you prefer & skanlite; to auto-save (by auto-generating a name and saving the image in a predefined directory) then you can choose Save without asking for a filename.
Save Location:
This setting defines where the images should be saved when Save without asking for a filename is chosen in the previous option. If the save dialog is to be opened for every image the default save location for the dialog will be the same as this parameter. The default save location is your home directory and you can change this location by clicking on the... button.
Name & Format:
This parameter defines the image prefix for the auto-saved images and is also the suggested name for the image in the save dialog. The auto-saved image will have a numeric suffix (the ### will be replaced by numbers) that is increased every time an image is saved.
You can also choose the save format of the file, default is png.
Specify image save quality
The user can chose to specify the image quality to be used for saving the images. The image quality setting affects the compression level used for saving. If Specify image save quality is not checked, the quality is the default value chosen by Qt.
Help, About, Settings and Close
At the bottom of the main window you find the Help, About, Settings and Close buttons.
