Eqv operator (logical)
Eqv Operator [Run-time]
Calculates the logical equivalence of two expressions.
Syntax:
Result = Expression1 Eqv Expression2
Parameters:
Result:
A numerical variable that will contain the result of the comparison.
Expression1, Expression2:
Boolean or numerical expressions that you want to compare.
True
if both expressions are either
True
or
False
.
In a bit-wise comparison, the Eqv operator only sets the corresponding bit in the result if a bit is set in both expressions, or in neither expression.
Example:
Sub ExampleEqv
Dim A as Variant, B as Variant, C as Variant, D as Variant
Dim vOut as Variant
A = 10:
B = 8:
C = 6:
D = Null
vOut = A > B Eqv B > C REM returns -1
vOut = B > A Eqv B > C REM returns 0
vOut = A > B Eqv B > D REM returns 0
vOut = (B > D Eqv B > A) REM returns -1
vOut = B Eqv A REM returns -3
End Sub
