Left Click Action (only for Konqueror file manager)
Show file in embedded viewer
Show file in separate viewer
Here you can configure what the Konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file belonging to this group. Konqueror can display the file in an embedded viewer or start up a separate application. You can change this setting for a specific file type in the'Embedding 'tab of the file type configuration. Dolphin shows files always in a separate viewer
This button displays the icon associated with the selected file type. Click on it to choose a different icon.
This is the icon associated with the selected file type. Choosing a different icon requires shared-mime-info to be at least version 0.40.
Filename Patterns
This box contains a list of patterns that can be used to identify files of the selected type. For example, the pattern *. txt is associated with the file type'text/ plain '; all files ending in'. txt 'are recognized as plain text files.
Add...
Add a new pattern for the selected file type.
Remove
Remove the selected filename pattern.
Description:
You can enter a short description for files of the selected file type (e. g. 'HTML Page '). This description will be used by applications like Konqueror to display directory content.
Ask whether to save to disk instead (only for Konqueror browser)
Here you can configure what the Konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file of this type. Konqueror can either display the file in an embedded viewer, or start up a separate application. If set to'Use settings for G group ', the file manager will behave according to the settings of the group G to which this type belongs; for instance, 'image' if the current file type is image/ png. Dolphin always shows files in a separate viewer.

File Associations This module allows you to choose which applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also referred to as MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"). A file association consists of the following: Rules for determining the MIME-type of a file, for example the filename pattern *. png, which means'all files with names that end in. png ', is associated with the MIME type "image/ png"; A short description of the MIME-type, for example the description of the MIME type "image/ png" is simply'PNG image'; An icon to be used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily identify the type of file in a file manager or file-selection dialog (at least for the types you use often); A list of the applications which can be used to open files of the given MIME-type -- if more than one application can be used then the list is ordered by priority. You may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated filename patterns; in these cases, KDE is able to determine the MIME-type by directly examining the contents of the file.
Find file type or filename pattern
Enter a part of a filename pattern, and only file types with a matching file pattern will appear in the list. Alternatively, enter a part of a file type name as it appears in the list.
Known Types
Here you can see a hierarchical list of the file types which are known on your system. Click on the '+ 'sign to expand a category, or the '-' sign to collapse it. Select a file type (e. g. text/ html for HTML files) to view/ edit the information for that file type using the controls on the right.
Click here to add a new file type.
& Remove
Select a file type by name or by extension
& Revert
Revert this file type to its initial system-wide definition
Click here to revert this file type to its initial system-wide definition, which undoes any changes made to the file type. Note that system-wide file types cannot be deleted. You can however empty their pattern list, to minimize the chances of them being used (but the file type determination from file contents can still end up using them).
Delete this file type definition completely
Click here to delete this file type definition completely. This is only possible for user-defined file types. System-wide file types cannot be deleted. You can however empty their pattern list, to minimize the chances of them being used (but the file type determination from file contents can still end up using them).

Application Preference Order
Services Preference Order
This is a list of applications associated with files of the selected file type. This list is shown in Konqueror's context menus when you select "Open With...". If more than one application is associated with this file type, then the list is ordered by priority with the uppermost item taking precedence over the others.
This is a list of services associated with files of the selected file type. This list is shown in Konqueror's context menus when you select a "Preview with..." option. If more than one service is associated with this file type, then the list is ordered by priority with the uppermost item taking precedence over the others.
Move & Up
Assigns a higher priority to the selected application, moving it up in the list. Note: This only affects the selected application if the file type is associated with more than one application.
Assigns a higher priority to the selected service, moving it up in the list.
Move & Down
Assigns a lower priority to the selected application, moving it down in the list. Note: This only affects the selected application if the file type is associated with more than one application.
Assigns a lower priority to the selected service, moving it down in the list.

Left Click Action
Click here to remove the selected file type.
The service %1 can not be removed.
The service is listed here because it has been associated with the %1 (%2) file type and files of type %3 (%4) are per definition also of type %5.
Either select the %1 file type to remove the service from there or move the service down to deprecate it.
Do you want to remove the service from the %1 file type or from the %2 file type?
