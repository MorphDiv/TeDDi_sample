Asteroid Designer
General Options
Detail level:
Random seed:
Randomization
Initial randomness:
How much to initially randomize an asteroid's shapes. This determines how distorted asteroids' general shapes will be.
Damping:
How much to decrease randomization after each detailing pass. Lower values lead to more "noisy" surface.
Post-randomness:
Final randomization to apply after all vertices are created. Use small non-zero values to apply some fine surface noise.
Starting value:
Iterative randomization:
Initial randomization amount for detail passes. Higher values will lead to more surface detail.
