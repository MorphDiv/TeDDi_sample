the page name contains wildcards

FILE...
The defaults are --man and --whatis.

show guessed series of preprocessing filters
ENCODING
use selected output encoding

[SECTION] PAGE...
reset all options to their default values
WARNINGS
enable warnings from groff
Main modes of operation:
equivalent to whatis
equivalent to apropos
search for text in all pages
print physical location of man page(s)
print physical location of cat file(s)
interpret PAGE argument(s) as local filename(s)
used by catman to reformat out of date cat pages
output source page encoded in ENCODING
Finding manual pages:
LOCALE
define the locale for this particular man search
SYSTEM
use manual pages from other systems
LIST
use colon separated section list
show all pages matching regex
show all pages matching wildcard
make --regex and --wildcard match page names only, not descriptions
find all matching manual pages
force a cache consistency check
don't try subpages, e.g. 'man foo bar' => 'man foo-bar'
Controlling formatted output:
PAGER
use program PAGER to display output
STRING
provide the `less' pager with a prompt
display ASCII translation of certain latin1 chars
turn off hyphenation
turn off justification
STRING indicates which preprocessors to run:
e - [n]eqn, p - pic, t - tbl,
g - grap, r - refer, v - vgrind
use %s to format pages
DEVICE
use %s with selected device
BROWSER
use %s or BROWSER to display HTML output
RESOLUTION
use groff and display through gxditview (X11):
-X = -TX75, -X100 = -TX100, -X100-12 = -TX100-12
use groff and force it to produce ditroff
