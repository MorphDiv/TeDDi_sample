Resume normal boot
You are now going to exit the recovery mode and continue the boot sequence. Please note that some graphic drivers require a full graphical boot and so will fail when resuming from recovery.
If that's the case, simply reboot from the login screen and then perform a standard boot.
Continuing will remount your / filesystem in read/write mode and mount any other filesystem defined in /etc/fstab.
Do you wish to continue?
The option you selected requires your filesystem to be in read-only mode. Unfortunately another option you selected earlier, made you exit this mode.
The easiest way of getting back in read-only mode is to reboot your system.
