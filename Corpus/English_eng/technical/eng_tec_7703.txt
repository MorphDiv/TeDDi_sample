EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
TYGACIL
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist..
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Tygacil?
Tygacil is an orange powder for solution for infusion (drip into a vein).
Tygacil contains the active substance tigecycline.
What is Tygacil used for?
Tygacil is an antibiotic.
It is used to treat adults with complicated infections of the abdomen or complicated skin and soft tissues infections (infections of the skin and the tissues below the skin).
Before using Tygacil, doctors need to look at official guidance they may have on the appropriate use of antibiotics.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Tygacil used?
The recommended dose is a starting dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days.
Each infusion should last between 30 and 60 minutes.
The length of treatment depends on where the infection is, how severe it is, and the patient ’ s response to treatment.
Doses are lower in patients with severe liver problems.
How does Tygacil work?
Tygacil contains the active substance tigecycline, which belongs to a group of antibiotics, similar to tetracycline, the glycylcyclines.
Tygacil works by blocking the bacteria's ribosomes, the parts of the cell where new proteins are produced.
When proteins cannot be produced, bacteria cannot multiply and eventually die.
The list of bacteria against which Tygacil is active can be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics.
How has Tygacil been studied?
The effectiveness of Tygacil has been studied in four main studies.
Two studies were in 1,568 patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (half of those were complicated appendicitis), where Tygacil was compared with imipenem/ cilastatin.
Two studies were in 1,129 patients with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (half of those were cases of cellulitis requiring hospitalisation), where Tygacil was compared with a combination of vancomycin and aztreonam.
All studies measured the clinical response (cure of the infection or failure to cure).

In all studies, Tygacil was as effective as the comparator antibiotics, and the percentages of patients whose infections were cured after treatment were similar:
80.6 and 91.3% in the studies of abdominal infection, against 82.4 and 89.9% for the comparator, and 82.9% and 89.7% in skin and soft tissue infections, against 82.3 and 94.4% for the comparator combination.
What is the risk associated with Tygacil?
The most common side effects (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are nausea (feeling sick), vomiting and diarrhoea.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Tygacil, see the Package Leaflet.
Tygacil should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to tigecycline or any of the other ingredients.
Patients allergic to tetracycline antibiotics may also be allergic to Tygacil.
Why has Tygacil been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Tygacil’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.
They recommended that Tygacil be given marketing authorisation.
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Tygacil?
The Company that makes Tygacil will monitor the development of resistance (when a germ that was sensitive to the action of an antibiotic develops ways of fighting its effects), they will also look at the mechanism of interaction of Tygacil with warfarin (a medicine used to thin blood), and the use of Tygacil in patients who have problems eliminating bile (cholestasis)
Other information about Tygacil:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Tygacil to Wyeth Europa Limited on 24 April 2006.
