About Converting Microsoft Office Documents
$[officename] can automatically open Microsoft Office 97/2000/XP documents.
However, some layout features and formatting attributes in more complex Microsoft Office documents are handled differently in $[officename] or are unsupported.
As a result, converted files require some degree of manual reformatting.
The amount of reformatting that can be expected is proportional to the complexity of the structure and formatting of the source document. $[officename] cannot run Visual Basic Scripts, but can load them for you to analyse.

.
The following lists provide a general overview of Microsoft Office features that may cause conversion challenges.
These will not affect your ability to use or work with the content of the converted document.
Microsoft Word
AutoShapes
Revision marks
OLE objects
Certain controls and Microsoft Office form fields
Indexes
Tables, frames and multi-column formatting
Hyperlinks and bookmarks
Microsoft WordArt graphics
Animated characters/text
Microsoft PowerPoint
AutoShapes
Tab, line and paragraph spacing
Master background graphics
Grouped objects
Certain multimedia effects
Microsoft Excel
AutoShapes
OLE objects
Certain controls and Microsoft Office form fields

Some functions/formulae (see below)
One example of differences between Calc and Excel is the handling of boolean values.
Enter TRUE to cells A1 and A2.
In Calc, the formula =A1+A2 returns the value 2, and the formula =SUM(A1;A2) returns 2.
In Excel, the formula =A1+A2 returns 2, but the formula =SUM(A1,A2) returns 0.
