Automatically Filling in Data Based on Adjacent Cells
You can automatically fill cells with data with the AutoFill command or the Series command.
Using AutoFill
AutoFill automatically generates a data series based on a defined pattern.
On a sheet, click in a cell, and type a number.
Click in another cell and then click back in the cell where you typed the number.
Drag the fill handle in the bottom right corner of the cell across the cells that you want to fill, and release the mouse button.
The cells are filled with ascending numbers.

You can double-click the fill handle to automatically fill all empty columns of the current data block.
For example, first enter Jan into A1 and drag the fill handle down to A12 to get the twelve months in the first column.
Now enter some values into B1 and C1.
Select those two cells, and double-click the fill handle.
This fills automatically the data block B1:C12.
Using a Defined Series
Select the cell range in the sheet that you want to fill.
