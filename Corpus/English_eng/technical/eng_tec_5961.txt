Modify Weekday State
Work & Vacation Editor A calendar defines availability for resources or tasks of type Duration. A calendar can be specific to a resource or task, or shared by multiple resources or tasks. A day can be of type Undefined, Non-working day or Working day. A working day has one or more work intervals defined. A calendar can have sub calendars. If a day is undefined in a calendar, the parent calendar is checked. An Undefined day defaults to Non-working if used by a resource, or available all day if used by a task.

Here you can enter your usual currency symbol, e. g. $or â‚¬.
This determines the number of fract digits for monetary values, i. e. the number of digits you find behind the decimal separator. Correct value is 2 for almost all people.
If this option is checked, the currency sign will be prefixed (i. e. to the left of the value) for all positive monetary values. If not, it will be postfixed (i. e. to the right).
If this option is checked, the currency sign will be prefixed (i. e. to the left of the value) for all negative monetary values. If not, it will be postfixed (i. e. to the right).
Here you can select how a positive sign will be positioned. This only affects monetary values.
Here you can select how a negative sign will be positioned. This only affects monetary values.

Resource Assignments View Settings
Resource Editor Resources are organized in a Resource Breakdown Structure. Resources can be of type Work or Material. When assigned to a task, a resource of type Work can affect the duration of the task, while a resource of type Material does not. A resource must refer to a Calendar that defines the working hours.

Controls resource overbooking when scheduling
Controls resource overbooking when scheduling. If overbooking is allowed, a resource may be booked (on working days) to work more than it is available. This can happen if the resource is allocated to multiple tasks or are booked on other projects. If overbooking is to be avoided, resources will not be booked more than they are available. On resource conflict, tasks will be delayed until the resource is available.
The distribution to be used during scheduling
The distribution to be used during schedulingIf distribution is'None ', the tasks estimate is used as is during scheduling. If distribution is'PERT', the estimate used is calculated based on the entered optimistic- (O), pessimistic-(P) and most likely (M) estimate. The formula used for this is (O + 4 * M + P) / 6.
Defines the schedules to be calculated
The scheduled start time
The scheduled finish time
The scheduling direction
The scheduling direction. If direction is Forward, the project is scheduled starting at the projects earliest start time specified in the main project dialog. If direction is Backward, the project is scheduled starting at the projects latest finish time specified in the main project dialog.
The scheduler used for calculating the project schedule
The scheduler used for calculating the project schedule. The default built-in scheduler is the Network Scheduler. Other schedulers presently available is RCPS if libRCPS is installed on your system. RCPS is a genetics based resource constrained project scheduler.

Scheduling Configuration. These settings affect the actual scheduling of the task. The estimation can be either effort based or duration based. If it is effort based, the final duration will depend on the resources assigned to the task. For duration based estimation, the assigned resources do n't affect the fixed duration of the task, but only the costs.

Estimate:
Risk controls the PERT distribution used when calculating the actual estimate for this task.
Risk controls the PERT distribution used when calculating the actual estimate for the task. None means the Expected estimate is used as is. Low risk means that a normal distribution is used. High risk means that the estimate will be slightly pessimistic compared to Low risk.

These values are used if your estimate is not in hours. Let us say Hours per day is 8. If you estimate that a task needs 3 days effort to complete, this is converted to 24 hours when the task is scheduled. The actual time it will take to complete is of course dependent on the availability of the person (or persons) that is assigned to the task.
