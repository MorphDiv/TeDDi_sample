When you click a hyperlink to a %PRODUCTNAME document in your Mozilla or Netscape browser, one of the following can happen:
The browser asks you whether you want to save the document on your disc, or whether you want to use an application to open the document.
This request dialogue box appears by default when you click a hyperlink to a %PRODUCTNAME document for the first time and you did not enable the Browser Plug-in.
The browser downloads the document to a temporary folder, then tells your system to run %PRODUCTNAME and open the document in %PRODUCTNAME.
This is the default when you did not enable the Browser Plug-in and chose to open the document with %PRODUCTNAME when you were first asked.
Edit File
