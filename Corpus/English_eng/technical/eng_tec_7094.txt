Iagno is the two player strategy game of Othello, which is also known as Reversi and is similar to Go. The pieces are tiles that are black on one side and white on the other and the objective is for the player to flip his/her opponent's tiles to his/her color, while keeping the opponent from doing the same. Once the board is filled with tiles, the winner is the player with the most of his/her color tiles on the board.

Why is Othello called Iagno?
You're probably wondering why this game is called
On a stormy night, like those depicted so much in England, a lonely programmer was sitting in front of his computer screen. Ian had finished his masterpiece in gaming. It was a fully interactive game of Othello and he decided to play a pun with the name and called it gnothello for the game was written using GNOME.
Iago is Othello's nemesis in the play
Later his buddies came over and like all programmers he showed off his masterpiece. They all laughed in his face and told Ian that his game was worthless and a pitiful attempt to be a true hacker. After Ian kicked them out he decided to rename his program Iago
Playing Iagno
The board starts with four tiles arranged in a box on the middle of the board. The tiles have the same color at each corner, as shown in
Starting Position
Screenshot of the starting position.
Black goes first and places a tile on the board such that it traps white's tiles between two of black's tiles. When black places a tile on the board all of white's tiles between black's newly placed tile and another black tile, in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, are flipped over and become black, as shown in
First Move
Screenshot of the first move.
White cannot capture the black tile in the center of the middle column because there are white tiles blocking the ends of that column. If it where blacks turn instead, black could place a tile at the top of the column but would only flip the first of the two white tiles.
Screenshot of black blocking.
When there is tile trapped between two tiles, of an identical color in the same row, the player captures tiles until another tile of the player's color is encountered, as shown in

Stagger Flips
This option causes captured tiles along a row, column, or diagonal to flip one after another, like dominoes, instead of all flipping simultaneously. It has no effect on game play, but looks cool.
Show Grid
This option will display a grid on top of the playing surface. The grid is useful to display because it shows the player exactly where they are placing each tile.
Tip:
This option should be enabled for beginning players to see the gameplay more clearly.
Flip Final Results
This option moves all the black tiles to the top of the board and all the white tiles to the bottom of the board at the end of the game. This allows you to visually see the outcome of the game.
This option does not affect the outcome of the game in any way.
Tile Set
This option lets you choose the type of board and tiles which are displayed. If you want to make your own tile sets use the classic tile set as a template and change the texture and colors for different effects. When you make a new tile set that works with Iagno send it to Ian Peters
Important:
There are two tile sets which look the same, but have different animations -- woodtrim and classic.

Joining a game room
Once you have successfully connected to a server, you can choose which game room to join. To play a multiplayer game of Iagno, select the Iagno room. If you want to host your own game, then click on the Launch button. This creates a new table where other players can participate in a game against you. If there are any other games already started, then you can double-click on an existing game table to join it. The list of game tables on the right shows you the number of available seats, which means the number of players that can join the game table.
This Iagno network dialog allows you to join a game room to find other players.
When creating a new table for Iagno games, a preference dialog is displayed which allows you to customize the game, such as set the minimum number of players for the game. Once the total number of seats have been taken, then no more players are allowed to join that game table.
It is possible to chat with other players in network games. Ask for advice or help playing the games, but please be polite against other players.
Waiting for other players to join the game
Once you have successfully joined a game table, then you have to wait until enough players have joined the table. The
Playing multiplayer Iagno games
Multiplayer Iagno games have pretty much the same rules as normal Iagno games, except that you are now playing against human players. This means that other strategies might possibly be better than when playing against AI players.
Once a player has won, the game ends and you can return to the initial network game screen. Then you can play yet another game of addictive Iagno multiplayer!
Known Bugs and Limitations
The computer player for Iagno is easy to beat.
