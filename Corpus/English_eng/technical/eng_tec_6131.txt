kabcclient
commandline client for the & kde; addressbook
kabcclient -A -R -M -S -L --match-case --nosave -ic codec -if format -if-opts format-options -oc codec -of format -of-opts format-options input-data
Description
kabcclient allows commandline access to the & kde; addressbook, for example in shell scripts. It supports input from stdin or through additional commandline arguments. Output is always written to stdout.
Options
Operation modes
-A, --add
Add a new contact entry to the addressbook
-R, --remove
Removes an existing contact entry from the addressbook
-M, --merge
Merges input data with an existing contact entry from the addressbook. This appends any new information to the already existing one
-S, --search
Searches the addressbook for matching contact entries
-L, --list
Lists all contact entries of the addressbook
Input options
-ic, --input-codec
Pass input text through a specified text encoding. See -ic help for additional information about input codecs. Default is local which will use the codec for the current locale 5 settings
-if, --input-format
Parses the input text according to given formatting rules. See -if help for available formats. Default is search
Instead of reading input text kabcclient can show a dialog for selecting contacts using the input format
dialog
-if-opts, --input-format-options
Additional options for the chosen input format. Can be optional as well as mandatory depending on the format. See -if-opts help for available format options
Output options
-oc, --output-codec
Pass output text through a specified text encoding. See -oc help for additional information about output codecs. Default is local which will use the codec for the current locale 5 settings.
-of, --output-format
Formats the output text according to given formatting rules. See -of help for available formats. Default is vcard
-of-opts, --output-format-options
Additional options for the chosen output format. Can be optional as well as mandatory depending on the format. See -of-opts help for available format options
Additional options
--match-case
Use case sensitive text matching when comparing input text with contact entries
--nosave
Perform information changing operations like -A, -R or -M only in memory but do not write the changes back to the addressbook
Diagnostics
As usual an exit status of zero indicates success. Depending on the chosen operation mode a non-zero exit status indicates a certain problem the application encountered
ADD
1
Reading the input text failed
2
Creating a suitable contact entry from the input text failed, e. g. not data or wrongly formatted input for the chosen input format
3
Saving the addressbook changes failed. This can be caused for example by other applications currently locking the addressbook.
REMOVE
The program could not remove any contact entry from the addressbook. This can be caused by failing to parse the input text, failing to find a matching contact entry in the addressbook or finding more than one matching contact entry in the addressbook. In the latter case an error message is written to stderr
MERGE
The program could not merge the input with any contact entry from the addressbook. This can be caused by failing to parse the input text, failing to find a matching contact entry in the addressbook or finding more than one matching contact entry in the addressbook. In the latter case an error message is written to stderr
SEARCH
The program could not find any matching contact entry in the addressbook. This can be caused by failing to parse the input text or failing to find a matching contact entry in the addressbook
Examples
Look for contact entries with Joe in either name or email addresses
kabcclient -S Joe
Do the same but use case sensitive matching
kabcclient --match-case -S Joe
Do the same but read input text from stdin
echo "Joe" | kabcclient --match-case -S
Try to add a new contact entry using data from a formatted email address
kabcclient --nosave --add -if email "Marilyn Monroe & lt; mmonroe@moviestars. comgt;"
Do the same but this time really save the changed addressbook
kabcclient --add -if email "Marilyn Monroe & lt; mmonroe@moviestars. comgt;"
Listing the available input formats
kabcclient -if help
Listing the available output formats
kabcclient -of help
Listing the available options for the'email 'output format
kabcclient -of email -of-opts help
