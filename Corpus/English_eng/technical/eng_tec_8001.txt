QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
ris Insulin human, rDNA (produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae).
1 ml contains 40 IU of insulin human
tho 1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 400 IU
One IU (International Unit) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin.
au Ultratard is an insulin zinc suspension.
The suspension consists of crystalline particles.
For excipients, see Section 6.1 List of excipients.

Ultratard is a cloudy, white, aqueous suspension. lon 4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS no
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of diabetes mellitus. t uc
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Ultratard is a long-acting insulin. rod
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined by the physician in accordance with the needs of the patient.
The average range of total daily insulin requirement for maintenance therapy in type 1 diabetic patients lP
lies between 0.5 and 1.0 IU/ kg.
In pre-pubertal children it usually varies from 0.7to 1.0 IU/ kg.
During the period of partial remission, the insulin requirements can be much lower, whereas in insulin resistant states e. g. during puberty or due to obesity, the daily insulin requirement may be substantially higher. na
Initial dosages for type 2 diabetic patients are often lower, e. g.
0.3 to 0.6 IU/ kg/ day.
The physician determines whether one or several daily injections are necessary.
Ultratard may be used i dic
alone or mixed with fast-acting insulin.
In intensive insulin therapy the suspension may be used as basal insulin (evening and/ or morning injection) with fast-acting insulin given at meals.
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset and slows the Me
progression of late diabetic complications.
Blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended.
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient's insulin requirement.
2 Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement.
Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet.
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to
ed another (see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use).
Administration For subcutaneous use.
ris Ultratard is usually administered subcutaneously in the thigh.
If convenient, the abdominal wall, the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used.
tho Subcutaneous injection into the thigh results in a slower and less variable absorption compared to the other injection sites.
au Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection.
Keep the needle under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected.
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy.
r Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously.
ge Ultratard is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed.
lon The vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypoglycaemia no
Hypersensitivity to human insulin or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1 List of excipients).
4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use t
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to uc
hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis.
Usually the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually, over a period of hours or days.
They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry rod
mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath (see section 4.8 Undesirable effects).
In type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is potentially lethal. lP
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement.
Hypoglycaemia can generally be corrected by immediate carbohydrate intake.
In order to be able to take action immediately, patients should carry glucose with them at all times. na
Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia.
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy, may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly (see section 4.8 Undesirable effects). i dic
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes.
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision.
Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (fast-, dual-, long-acting insulin etc.), species (animal, human or analogue insulin) and/ or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus Me
animal source insulin) may result in a change in dosage.
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Ultratard, it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months.
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin.
3 Before travelling between different time zones, the patient should be advised to consult the doctor, since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times.
ed Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps.
Ultratard contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate, which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).
ris 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
tho A number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism.
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask their patients about any medicinal products they take.
au The following substances may reduce insulin requirement:
Oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), non-selective beta- blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates and alcohol.
r The following substances may increase insulin requirement:
ge Thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics, growth hormone and danazol.
lon Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia.
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement. no
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation t
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not uc
pass the placental barrier.
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes rod
therapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero.
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy.
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase subsequently during the second and lP
third trimesters.
After delivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. na
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby.
However, the Ultratard dosage may need to be adjusted.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines i dic
The patientâ€™ s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia.
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e. g. driving a car or operating machinery).
Me
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving.
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances.
4 4.8 Undesirable effects
The most often seen undesirable effect in insulin-treated patients is a change in blood glucose levels.
From clinical investigations it is known that major hypoglycaemia, defined as need for assistance
ed in treatment, occurs in approximately 20% of well-controlled patients.
Based on post-marketing experience adverse drug reactions including hypoglycaemia have been reported rarely (> 1/ 10,000 < 1/ 1,000).
The listings below are all based on post-marketing experience and is subject to underreporting and should be interpreted in that light.
ris Metabolism and nutrition disorders
tho Rare (> 1/ 10,000 < 1/ 1,000) Change in blood glucose
Hypoglycaemia:
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly.
They may include
au cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or
r convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of
ge brain function or even death.
Hyperglycaemia: lon Usually the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia set in gradually, over a period of hours or days.
They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath.
In type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to no
diabetic ketoacidosis which is potentially lethal.
For precautions see section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use. t

These symptoms are usually of transitory nature.
General disorders and administration site conditions lP
Very rare (< 1/ 10,000) na
Local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin.
These reactions are usually transitory and normally they disappear during continued treatment.
Very rare (< 1/ 10,000) i dic
Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area.
Very rare (< 1/ 10,000) Me
Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema,
difficulties in breathing, palpitation and reduction in blood pressure.
Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life threatening.
Very rare (< 1/ 10,000)
Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy.
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature.
5 4.9 Overdose
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined.
However, hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages:
ed â€¢ Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products.
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. â€¢ Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by
ris glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional.
Glucose must also be given intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15
tho minutes.
Upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse.
After an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason
au for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
r ge 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antidiabetic agent ATC code:
A10A E01. lon The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver. no
Ultratard is a very long-acting insulin.
Onset of action is within 4 hours, reaches a maximum effect within 8-24 hours and the entire time of duration is approximately 28-32 hours. t
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties uc
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes.
Consequently, the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics. rod
This process is influenced by several factors (e. g. insulin dosage, injection route and site, thickness of subcutaneous fat, type of diabetes).
The pharmacokinetics of insulins is therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation. lP
Absorption The maximum plasma concentration of the insulins is reached within 2-18 hours after subcutaneous na
administration.
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins, except circulating insulin antibodies (if present) has been i dic
observed.
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and Me
possibly protein disulfide isomerase.
A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active.
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue.
The terminal half-life (tÂ½) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
6 insulin from plasma (insulin in the blood stream has a tÂ½ of a few minutes).
Trials have indicated a tÂ½ of about 13-15 hours.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
ed Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.
