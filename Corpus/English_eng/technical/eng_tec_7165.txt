UUIDs of extensions to enable
GNOME Shell extensions have a UUID property; this key lists extensions which should be loaded. Any extension that wants to be loaded needs to be in this list. You can also manipulate this list with the EnableExtension and DisableExtension D-Bus methods on org.gnome.Shell.
Disables the validation of extension version compatibility
GNOME Shell will only load extensions that claim to support the current running version. Enabling this option will disable this check and try to load all extensions regardless of the versions they claim to support.

The maximum accuracy level of location.
Configures the maximum level of location accuracy applications are allowed to see. Valid options are 'off' (disable location tracking), 'country', 'city', 'neighborhood', 'street', and 'exact' (typically requires GPS receiver). Please keep in mind that this only controls what GeoClue will allow applications to see and they can find user's location on their own using network resources (albeit with street-level accuracy at best).

Record a screencast
Whether to collect stats about applications usage
The shell normally monitors active applications in order to present the most used ones (e.g. in launchers). While this data will be kept private, you may want to disable this for privacy reasons. Please note that doing so won't remove already saved data.
Internally used to store the last IM presence explicitly set by the user. The value here is from the TpConnectionPresenceType enumeration.
Internally used to store the last session presence status for the user. The value here is from the GsmPresenceStatus enumeration.
Keybinding to toggle the screen recorder
Keybinding to start/stop the builtin screen recorder.
Framerate used for recording screencasts.
The framerate of the resulting screencast recordered by GNOME Shell's screencast recorder in frames-per-second.
The gstreamer pipeline used to encode the screencast
Sets the GStreamer pipeline used to encode recordings. It follows the syntax used for gst-launch. The pipeline should have an unconnected sink pad where the recorded video is recorded. It will normally have a unconnected source pad; output from that pad will be written into the output file. However the pipeline can also take care of its own output - this might be used to send the output to an icecast server via shout2send or similar. When unset or set to an empty value, the default pipeline will be used. This is currently 'vp8enc min_quantizer=13 max_quantizer=13 cpu-used=5 deadline=1000000 threads=%T ! queue ! webmmux' and records to WEBM using the VP8 codec. %T is used as a placeholder for a guess at the optimal thread count on the system.
File extension used for storing the screencast
The filename for recorded screencasts will be a unique filename based on the current date, and use this extension. It should be changed when recording to a different container format.
