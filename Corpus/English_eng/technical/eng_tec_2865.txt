(PHP 4 = 4.0.6)
Returns:
A positive FrontBase persistent link identifier on success, or FALSE on error.
fbsql_pconnect() establishes a connection to a FrontBase server.
The following defaults are assumed for missing optional parameters: host = 'localhost', username = "_SYSTEM "and password = empty password.
fbsql_pconnect() acts very much like fbsql_connect() with two major differences.
To set Frontbase server port number, use fbsql_select_db().
First, when connecting, the function would first try to find a (persistent) link that's already open with the same host, username and password.
If one is found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.
Second, the connection to the SQL server will not be closed when the execution of the script ends.
Instead, the link will remain open for future use.
This type of links is therefore called 'persistent'.
