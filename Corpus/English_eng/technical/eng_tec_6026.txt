If you want to, a backup of your existing data will be created before the conversion starts.

KWallet is not available. It is strongly recommended to use KWallet for managing your passwords. However, KNode can store the password in its configuration file instead. The password is stored in an obfuscated format, but should not be considered secure from decryption efforts if access to the configuration file is obtained. Do you want to store the password for server '%1 'in the configuration file?
