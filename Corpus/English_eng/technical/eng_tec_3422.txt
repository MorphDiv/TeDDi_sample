(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns TRUE if the stream is still alive, FALSE otherwise.
imap_ping() function pings the stream to see it is still active.
It may discover new mail; this is the preferred method for a periodic "new mail check "as well as a "keep alive" for servers which have inactivity timeout. (As PHP scripts do not tend to run that long, i can hardly imagine that this function will be usefull to anyone.)
