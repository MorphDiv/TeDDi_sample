Appendix C.
Migrating from PHP / FI 2 to PHP 3

In PHP 3.0 boolean evaluation is short-circuited.
This means that in an expression like (1 | | test_me()), the function test_me() would not be executed since nothing can change the result of the expression after the 1.
This is a minor compatibility issue, but may cause unexpected side-effects.
