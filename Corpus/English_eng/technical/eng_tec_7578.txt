Red Eye Removal


This tool works best when there is a high color contrast between the red eye and the surrounding facial area. It does not work well for "orange eye" sometimes seen in photos of children, or if the surrounding skin has a reddish tinge. This tool could use improvement - if you are fiendishly clever, love matrix algebra and open source software, please
Resizing and Cropping
Two tools are provided to resize and crop images.
Resize
This allows you to resize the image. The image may be scaled to a certain physical size, or to a certain percentage of the original size. The aspect ratio may be locked to a specific value, or freely adjusted.
Crop
This allows you to crop the image. Click and drag the mouse over the desired area of the image. The area may be locked to a specific aspect ratio, or it may be freely adjusted. A rule-of-thirds grid or golden-sections grid may be superimposed over the image for composition guidance.

Rotations and Flips
Several tools are provided to manipulate the orientation of images.
Mirror
This flips the image horizontally. The left and right sides are swapped.
Flip
This flips the image vertically. The top and bottom are swapped.
Rotate Right
This rotates the image clockwise.
Rotate Left
This rotates the image counter-clockwise.
The rotations offered in the edit mode act on the image in memory. They are not direct file operations. For jpeg images, these means they are not lossless operations - the image will degrade slightly when it it is re-encoded and saved. However,
Color Adjustments
Several tools are provided to manipulate the colors in images.
Enhance Colors
This tool provides automatic white balance correction. No user adjustments are required.
Adjust Colors
This tool provides manual color adjustments. Adjustments to the gamma, brightness, contrast, saturation, and the cyan/red, magenta/green, and yellow/blue color balances may be made.
Equalize
This tool provides automatic histogram equalization. No user adjustments are required.
Desaturate
This tool converts the image colors into shades of grey. (This does not change this image storage format.)
Negative
This tool inverts the color levels, providing an image negative.
File Save, Undo, Redo
Multiple changes may be made to an image before saving it.

Renaming Files
To rename one or more images using a name template, select the files in the browser and choose
The name template is simply a pattern that is used for renaming all of the selected images. You can use some special characters to make the new names differ each other (this is essential if you are renaming more than one image, and optional if you are renaming a single image):
Symbol
#
This symbol will be replaced with the value of a counter that increments itself by 1 passing from one image to another. If you specify this symbols in sequence you'll get leading zeros if the counter value has a lesser number of digits, for example ### will produce the sequence: 001, 002, 003, etc..
%F
This symbol will be replaced with the file's original name, excluding the original extension.
%E
This symbol will be replaced with the file's original filename extension.
%N
This symbol will be replaced with original image enumerator. For instance, if the original filename was IMG_9876.JPG, this extracts the "9876" portion. If the filename has more than one group of digits embedded in it (for example, IMG_123_456.JPG) only the first number will be used ("123" in this example).
%M{format}
This symbol will be replaced with the file modification date. The formatting of this date (and optionally time) can be specified by adding a standard formatting code in curly braces. For example, "%M{%Y-%m-%d, %T}" would be replaced with a date and time like "2010-04-01, 15:02:01".
%D{format}
This symbol will be replaced with the date that the photo was original taken (normally determined from the EXIF datestamps embedded inside the photo). The formatting of this date (and optionally time) can be specified by adding a standard formatting code in curly braces. For example, "%D{%Y-%m-%d, %T}" would be replaced with a date and time like "2010-04-01, 15:02:01".
%A{identifier}
This symbol will be replaced with the data that has been specified by the identifier. For example, "%A{ general::dimensions }" would be replaced with a size like "320 x 240".
A summary of these special codes may be viewed by clicking on the Help icon inside the template field.
The list at the bottom of the dialog displays how the filenames will be renamed.
To rename the images click on
If the renaming of an image can overwrite an already existing image you will be asked how to proceed, five options are available: overwrite the image; do not overwrite the image; always overwrite; never overwrite; specify a new name.

The toolbar contains a subset of the commands that you can access from the menubar. In particular, the Tools button contains functions for batch processing multiple images.
Locationbar
The locationbar contains the current folder or catalog name.
Folder Tree
The folder tree allows you to navigate the filesystem. Single-clicking on a folder will load its images in the browser view. Double-clicking a folder, or clicking the expander arrow, will also list folder's subfolders in the tree.
Browser View
The browser view shows the images in the current folder or catalog. Single-clicking an image will enable the Information Sidebar for that image. Double-clicking an image will open it in the viewer mode. Double-clicking with the middle mouse button will load the image in fullscreen viewer mode.
Organize Button
The Organize button, just above the browser view, allows you to group images into catalogs.
Statusbar
On the statusbar you can read:
the total number of images contained in the current folder or catalog and their total size.
the number of the selected images and their size.
some properties of the currently focused image.
Information Sidebar
If a single image is selected, the information sidebar (below the folder tree) will display detailed information (such as EXIF or XMP tags) about the selected image.
Filter Bar
An image filtering tool is provided just below the browser view. This can be used to filter the displayed images. For example, the browser view can be limited to files of a certain size, date, or name pattern, or other characteristics.

Date/Time Format Codes
This is a summary of standard date/time codes that may be used in format strings:
Valid format codes for custom subfolders
%a
The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.
%A
The full weekday name according to the current locale.
%b
The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.
%B
The full month name according to the current locale.
%c
The preferred date and time representation for the current locale.
%C
The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.
%d
The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).
%D
Equivalent to %m/%d/%y. (Yecch -- for Americans only. Americans should note that in other countries %d/%m/%y is rather common. This means that in international context this format is ambiguous and should not be used.)
%e
Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a leading zero is replaced by a space.
Modifier: use alternative format, see below.
Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format). (C99)
%G
The ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number. The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week number (see %V). This has the same format and value as %y, except that if the ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead.
%g
Like %G, but without century, i.e., with a 2-digit year (00-99).
%h
Equivalent to %b.
%H
The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).
%I
The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12).
%j
The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).
%k
The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %H.)
%l
The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12); single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %I.)
%m
The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).
%M
The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).
%O
%p
Either 'AM' or 'PM' according to the given time value, or the corresponding strings for the current locale. Noon is treated as 'pm' and midnight as 'am'.
%P
Like %p but in lowercase: 'am' or 'pm' or a corresponding string for the current locale.
%r
The time in a.m. or p.m. notation. In the POSIX locale this is equivalent to '%I:%M:%S %p'.
%R
The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M). For a version including the seconds, see %T below.
%s
The number of seconds since the Epoch, i.e., since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
%S
The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60). (The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)
%T
The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).
%u
The day of the week as a decimal number, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1. See also %w.
%U
The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of week 01. See also %V and %W.
%V
The ISO 8601:1988 week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at least 4 days in the current year, and with Monday as the first day of the week. See also %U and %W.
%w
The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0. See also %u.
%W
The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as the first day of week 01.
%x
The preferred date representation for the current locale without the time.
%X
The preferred time representation for the current locale without the date.
%y
The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).
%Y
The year as a decimal number including the century.
%z
The time-zone as hour offset from GMT. Required to emit RFC 822-conformant dates (using "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z").
%Z
The time zone or name or abbreviation.
Some conversion specifications can be modified by preceding the conversion specifier character by the E or O modifier to indicate that an alternative format should be used. If the alternative format or specification does not exist for the current locale, the behaviour will be as if the unmodified conversion specification were used. The Single Unix Specification mentions %Ec, %EC, %Ex, %EX, %Ey, %EY, %Od, %Oe, %OH, %OI, %Om, %OM, %OS, %Ou, %OU, %OV, %Ow, %OW, %Oy, where the effect of the O modifier is to use alternative numeric symbols (say, roman numerals), and that of the E modifier is to use a locale-dependent alternative representation.
