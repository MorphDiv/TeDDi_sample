2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
1 ml contains 330.9 mg gadoversetamide, equivalent to 500 micromol.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Solution for injection.
Clear, colourless to pale yellow solution. pH:
6.0 – 7.5 Osmolality (37°C):
1000 – 1200 mOsm/ kg
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.
Optimark is indicated for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (CNS) and liver.
It provides contrast enhancement and facilitates visualization and helps with the characterization of focal lesions and abnormal structures in the CNS and liver in patients with known or highly suspected pathology.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Optimark should only be administered by physicians experienced in clinical MRI practice.
The agent should be administered as a bolus peripheral intravenous injection at a dose of 0.2 ml/ kg (100 micromol/ kg) body weight.
To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the injection should be followed by a 5 ml flush of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) injection.
The imaging procedure should be completed within 1 hour of administration of the contrast medium.
In cranial MRI, if a strong clinical suspicion of a lesion persists despite a single dose contrast- enhanced MRI or when more accurate information on the number, size or extent of lesions might influence management or therapy of the patient, in subjects with normal renal function, a second bolus injection of 100 micromol/ kg may be administered within 30 minutes of the first injection as it may increase the diagnostic yield of the examination.
The safety of repeat doses has not been established in children and adolescents, in patients with renal impairment, or the elderly.
Limited data with other gadolinium contrast agents suggests that for the exclusion of additional cranial metastases in a patient with a known solitary resectable metastasis, an MR exam with the injection of the dose of 300 micromol/ kg body weight of Optimark may lead to higher diagnostic confidence.
Optimark is not recommended for use in children below the age of two years because the safety, efficacy, and impact of immature kidney function have not been studied in this age group.
Optimark has been studied in children of 2 years and older with a similar safety profile as shown in the adult population.
The container and the solution should be inspected prior to use as described in section 6.6.
2 Insertion of a flexible in-dwelling venous catheter is recommended, see section 4.4.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to gadoversetamide or to any of the excipients or to other gadolinium containing products.
Optimark is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30ml/ min/ 1.73m2), and those who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation (see section 4.4).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any paramagnetic contrast agent, enhancement of MRI with gadoversetamide may impair the visualization of existing lesions.
Some of these lesions may be seen on unenhanced, non-contrast MRI.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when contrast enhanced scan interpretation is made in the absence of a companion unenhanced MRI.
Before the examination, care must be taken that patients are sufficiently hydrated.
The usual contraindications of MR examinations must be applied, such as exclusion of patients with infusion pumps, pacemakers, ferro-magnetic clips etc.
 Hypersensitivity Allergoid and other idiosyncratic reactions may occur with all contrast media for intravenous application, also with gadoversetamide, which could become manifest in form of cardiovascular, respiratory and skin reactions (see section 4.8).
Most of these reactions occur within half an hour after administering the contrast medium.
As with all other contrast media of the same class, late reactions may occur (after hours or days) in rare cases; however, none were reported in the completed clinical trials.
If hypersensitivity reactions occur, the administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary.
During the examination, supervision by a physician is necessary and insertion of a flexible in-dwelling catheter is recommended.
To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products (e. g. epinephrine/ adrenaline, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and atropines), endotracheal tube and ventilator must be immediately available.
The risk of hypersensitivity reactions is increased in the following cases:
- patients with allergic predisposition
- patients with bronchial asthma; in these patients it is especially the risk of bronchospasm which is
increased
- patients with a history of reactions to contrast agents, including a previous history of reaction to
iodine-based contrast agents Before the injection of contrast media, patients should be asked whether they have any allergies (e. g. allergies to seafood or medicinal products, hay fever, urticaria), whether they are hypersensitive to contrast media and whether they have bronchial asthma.
Premedication with antihistamines and/ or glucocorticoids may be considered.  Patients taking beta-blockers It should be noted that patients using beta-blockers do not necessarily respond to the beta-agonists usually used for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions.  Patients with cardiovascular disease In this group of patients hypersensitivity reactions may be severe.
Especially in patients with serious heart diseases (e. g. severe heart failure, coronary artery disease) cardiovascular reactions may deteriorate.
However, these were not evident from clinical trials with Optimark.  Central nervous system disorders In patients suffering from epilepsy or brain lesions the likelihood of convulsions during the examination may be increased.
Precautions are necessary when examining these patients (e. g. monitoring of the patient) and the equipment and medicinal products needed for the rapid treatment of possible convulsions should be available.
3  Renal impairment and liver transplant patients There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30ml/ min/ 1.73m2) and those who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation.
Therefore Optimark should not be used in these populations (see section 4.3).
Cases of NSF have also been reported in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR < 60ml/ min/ 1.73m2) with use of gadolinium-containing contrast agents.
Optimark should be used in these patients with caution.
Gadoversetamide is dialysable.
Haemodialysis shortly after Optimark administration in patients currently receiving haemodialysis may be useful at removing Optimark from the body.
There is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis.  Children Optimark must not be administered with an autoinjector.
The required dose should be administered by hand to children to avoid overdosage by mistake.  Neonates and infants Optimark should not be used in children below the age of two years.
Safety and efficacy have not been studied in this age group.  Sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of up to 17 ml, i. e. essentially ‘ sodium- free’.
Higher doses contain 1 mmol of sodium or more, which should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.  Serum iron and zinc Caution should be exercised because transient decreases in serum iron and zinc parameters have been observed in clinical trials.
The clinical significance of this is unknown.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No formal interaction studies have been performed.
Optimark has been shown to cause interference in the measurement of serum calcium using the ortho- cresolphthalein complexone (OCP) colorimetric method.
However, the administration of gadoversetamide does not cause a true decrease in serum calcium.
In the presence of gadoversetamide, the OCP technique produces an erroneous, low value for plasma calcium.
The magnitude of this measurement artefact is proportional to the concentration of gadoversetamide in the blood, and in patients with normal renal clearance accurate values can be obtained approximately 90 minutes following injection.
In patients with compromised renal function, clearance of gadoversetamide will be slowed and the interference with calcium determination by OCP prolonged.
Gadoversetamide does not affect other methods of measuring serum calcium, such as the arsenazo III colorimetric method, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy.
4.6 Pregnancy and Lactation
There is no clinical experience with the use of gadoversetamide during pregnancy.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Optimark should not be used during pregnancy except in cases where a contrast enhanced MR scan is determined to be critical, with no acceptable alternative imaging examination.
The degree of excretion of gadoversetamide in breast milk has not been studied in humans.
Based on animal studies, the rate of excretion is expected to be low.
At clinical doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated.
Optimark can be used during breast-feeding.
4 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Ambulant patients while driving vehicles or operating machinery should take into account that dizziness may incidentally occur.
4.8 Undesirable Effects
Most of the undesirable effects were of mild to moderate intensity and transient in nature.
The most common undesirable effects were dysgeusia, feeling hot, headache and dizziness.
The majority of adverse reactions observed after the use of gadoversetamide were found to be adverse reactions of the nervous system, followed by general adverse reactions, gastrointestinal disorders/ skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
The following drug-related adverse reactions have been reported from clinical trials and from post- marketing use of gadoversetamide.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Serious adverse reactions have been reported and include anaphylactic reactions, cardiovascular reactions, and allergic respiratory disorders.
Treatment should be symptomatic and immediate access to necessary medicinal products and emergency equipment should be available should a serious event occur.
Local reactions have occurred at the injection site and may lead to local irritation type reactions.
Cases of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis have been reported.
4.9 Overdose
Gadoversetamide has been tested in humans in doses up to 700 micromol/ kg (seven times the standard dose).
Clinical consequences of an overdose have not been reported.
Acute toxicity symptoms are unlikely to occur in patients with normal renal function.
Dialysis can be used to remove gadoversetamide from the blood.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic Group:
Paramagnetic MRI contrast media, ATC code:
V08C A06
Gadoversetamide is a chelate containing gadolinium - which has paramagnetic properties and is responsible for the contrast enhancement effect in MRI - and the ligand versetamide.
The purpose of an MRI contrast agent is to induce signal intensity changes within the lesion thereby facilitating its recognition from the surrounding normal structures.
The use of a contrast agent may therefore reduce the threshold for lesion detection and visualization.
Gadolinium containing MRI contrast agents (gadolinium-based chelates) are designed to act indirectly on the local magnetic environment by altering proton T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times and at the usual concentration of 100 micromol/ kg, the T1 shortening predominates, and the T2 shortening is not significant using T1-weighted sequences.
Gadoversetamide, an extracellular gadolinium chelate, after intravenous administration, equilibrates rapidly within the extracellular fluid/ space and is eliminated primarily by glomerular filtration.
As a result of these characteristics, the timing of the image acquisition after contrast administration is critical in liver imaging.
For liver metastases, the signal difference between the tumour and
6 surrounding liver tissue is significantly improved during the first 90 seconds after an extracellular gadolinium contrast agent is administered.
Therefore, a rapid imaging sequence should be initiated 20 seconds after bolus injection of the contrast agent when the agent is predominately in the hepatic arteries and then again at 60 seconds after injection during the dominant portal venous phase.
Since the hepatic artery and portal venous system supply approximately 20% and 80% of the hepatic blood supply, respectively, the earlier (hepatic arterial phase) images provide optimal lesion conspicuity for hypervascular lesions and the portal venous phase images are useful for hypovascular lesions (most metastatic lesions are relatively hypovascular and are better demonstrated during the portal venous phase, manifesting as areas of lower signal intensity compared with the markedly enhanced liver).
Lesion conspicuity of hypo- and hypervascular lesions may be reduced if imaging is delayed more than 3 minutes due to the diffusion of the contrast agent into the interstitial spaces of both the liver parenchyma and lesion (e. g. metastasis) making the lesion isointense with the normal liver parenchyma.
Delayed post-contrast or equilibrium images (> 5 minutes after dosing) assist in the characterization of lesions, e. g. the centre of a metastasis may accumulate contrast in the interstitial space of the lesion and become hyperintense to the normal liver.
This difference in enhancement pattern is useful in formulating a differential diagnosis based on lesion characterization and diagnostic confidence.
The enhancement of brain tumours using a gadolinium (or iodine) containing contrast agent depends on the disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB).
As a result, these agents have been referred to as markers for sites of abnormal BBB breakdown.
When the BBB is disrupted, the gadoversetamide molecules diffuse into the interstitial compartment thereby producing the characteristic paramagnetic effect of T1 and T2 shortening.
In general, the addition of contrast to MRI, at the standard clinical dose of 100 micromol/ kg, has led to a significantly improved lesion detection, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Distribution The pharmacokinetics of gadoversetamide conforms to a two compartment open-model.
At the 100 micromol/ kg dose, the mean distribution half life in normal subjects calculated by the method of residuals in 12 normal volunteers is 13.3 ± 6.8 min.
Mean volume of distribution at the 100 micromol/ kg dose in non-renally impaired patients (including both normal subjects and patients with CNS or liver pathology) was 158.7 ± 29.0 to 214.3 (range 116.4 to 295.0) ml/ kg.
This volume of distribution (approximately 10-15 l for a body weight of 70 kg) is consistent with a medicinal product which distributes into the extracellular fluid.
Dose level has no consistent effect on the volume of distribution in any of the studies.
Gadoversetamide does not undergo protein binding in vitro.
Elimination The elimination half life at the 100 micromol/ kg dose ranges from 1.49 ± 0.15 h in healthy volunteers to 2.11 ± 0.62 h in non-renally impaired patients (including normal subjects and patients with CNS or liver pathology).
The mean plasma clearance of gadoversetamide in healthy subjects (111.0 ± 14.1 ml/ min/ 1.73m² BSA) is not significantly different from the mean renal clearance.
Similar results are obtained in normal subjects and patients with various combinations of liver, CNS and renal dysfunctions with renal clearance of gadoversetamide being approximately 95% of the total plasma clearance.
Such results (ratio renal clearance/ total plasma clearance close to 1) indicate that gadoversetamide is essentially cleared through the kidneys.
There was no systematic difference in any of the kinetic parameters as a function of dose level (100 to 700 micromol/ kg).
Therefore, within this dose range, the kinetics of gadoversetamide appear to be linear.
Metabolism The high accountability for the dose as intact complex in urine suggests that no significant metabolism of gadoversetamide occurs in humans.
7 Special Populations
Effect of Gender:
Adult male and female subjects were enrolled in two pharmacokinetic studies.
No significant differences in pharmacokinetics based on gender were identified.
Effects of Age:
When corrected for body weight, the total body clearance of gadoversetamide is greater in the 2 to 11 year age group (143 ± 27.9 ml/ h/ kg) than that observed in the 12 to 18 year age group (117 ± 26.1 ml/ h/ kg) and the two adult populations (82.1 ± 16.8 and 56.5 ± 9.7 ml/ h/ kg in the 19 to 64 and ≥ 65 year of age groups, respectively).
The elimination half life in the 2 to 11 and 12 to 18 year age groups (1.4 ± 0.3 and 1.6± 0.3 h-1, respectively) is shorter than that observed in the two adult populations (1.9 ± 0.5 and 2.5± 0.5 h-1 in the 19 to 64 and ≥ 65 year of age groups, respectively).
The number of elderly patients in whom the pharmacokinetics were determined was limited (over 65 years, N=3).
Effect of Renal Impairment Gadoversetamide plasma levels increase linearly with decreasing renal function; in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/ min) this even leads to a six-fold decreased gadoversetamide clearance and a corresponding six-fold increased extent of exposure AUC and t½.
Since gadoversetamide is only administered as a single dose this will lead to a longer and higher exposure for a limited duration.
Still, after 72 hours even in patients with severe renal impairment nearly the whole dose is recovered in the urine and in healthy populations up to 500 micromol/ kg doses were administered without safety issues.
Nevertheless, because of reported cases of NSF that may be associated with renal impairment for other gadolinium containing contrast agents and for gadoversetamide, Optimark should not be used in these patients.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute toxicity, reproductive toxicity, local tolerance, antigenicity, and genotoxicity.
No carcinogenicity studies were performed.
Repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs revealed vacuolation of the tubular cells of the kidneys, with strong evidence for reversibility of the effect.
No functional impairment was observed.

Optimark has been studied in children of 2 years and older with a similar safety profile as shown in the adult population.
The container and the solution should be inspected prior to use as described in section 6.6.
11 Insertion of a flexible in-dwelling venous catheter is recommended, see section 4.4.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to gadoversetamide or to any of the excipients or to other gadolinium containing products.
Optimark is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30ml/ min/ 1.73m2), and those who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation (see section 4.4).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any paramagnetic contrast agent, enhancement of MRI with gadoversetamide may impair the visualization of existing lesions.
Some of these lesions may be seen on unenhanced, non-contrast MRI.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when contrast enhanced scan interpretation is made in the absence of a companion unenhanced MRI.
Before the examination, care must be taken that patients are sufficiently hydrated.
The usual contraindications of MR examinations must be applied, such as exclusion of patients with infusion pumps, pacemakers, ferro-magnetic clips etc.
 Hypersensitivity Allergoid and other idiosyncratic reactions may occur with all contrast media for intravenous application, also with gadoversetamide, which could become manifest in form of cardiovascular, respiratory and skin reactions (see section 4.8).
Most of these reactions occur within half an hour after administering the contrast medium.
As with all other contrast media of the same class, late reactions may occur (after hours or days) in rare cases; however, none were reported in the completed clinical trials.
If hypersensitivity reactions occur, the administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary.
During the examination, supervision by a physician is necessary and insertion of a flexible in-dwelling catheter is recommended.
To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products (e. g. epinephrine/ adrenaline, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and atropines), endotracheal tube and ventilator must be immediately available.
The risk of hypersensitivity reactions is increased in the following cases:
- patients with allergic predisposition
- patients with bronchial asthma; in these patients it is especially the risk of bronchospasm which is
increased
- patients with a history of reactions to contrast agents, including a previous history of reaction to
iodine-based contrast agents Before the injection of contrast media, patients should be asked whether they have any allergies (e. g. allergies to seafood or medicinal products, hay fever, urticaria), whether they are hypersensitive to contrast media and whether they have bronchial asthma.
Premedication with antihistamines and/ or glucocorticoids may be considered.  Patients taking beta-blockers It should be noted that patients using beta-blockers do not necessarily respond to the beta-agonists usually used for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions.  Patients with cardiovascular disease In this group of patients hypersensitivity reactions may be severe.
Especially in patients with serious heart diseases (e. g. severe heart failure, coronary artery disease) cardiovascular reactions may deteriorate.
However, these were not evident from clinical trials with Optimark.  Central nervous system disorders In patients suffering from epilepsy or brain lesions the likelihood of convulsions during the examination may be increased.
Precautions are necessary when examining these patients (e. g. monitoring of the patient) and the equipment and medicinal products needed for the rapid treatment of possible convulsions should be available.
12  Renal impairment and liver transplant patients There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30ml/ min/ 1.73m2) and those who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation.
Therefore Optimark should not be used in these populations (see section 4.3).
Cases of NSF have also been reported in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR < 60ml/ min/ 1.73m2) with use of gadolinium-containing contrast agents.
Optimark should be used in these patients with caution.
Gadoversetamide is dialysable.
Haemodialysis shortly after Optimark administration in patients currently receiving haemodialysis may be useful at removing Optimark from the body.
There is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis.  Children Optimark must not be administered with an autoinjector.
The required dose should be administered by hand to children to avoid overdosage by mistake.  Neonates and infants Optimark should not be used in children below the age of two years.
Safety and efficacy have not been studied in this age group.  Sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of up to 17 ml, i. e. essentially ‘ sodium- free’.
Higher doses contain 1 mmol of sodium or more, which should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.  Serum iron and zinc Caution should be exercised because transient decreases in serum iron and zinc parameters have been observed in clinical trials.
The clinical significance of this is unknown.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No formal interaction studies have been performed.
Optimark has been shown to cause interference in the measurement of serum calcium using the ortho- cresolphthalein complexone (OCP) colorimetric method.
However, the administration of gadoversetamide does not cause a true decrease in serum calcium.
In the presence of gadoversetamide, the OCP technique produces an erroneous, low value for plasma calcium.
The magnitude of this measurement artefact is proportional to the concentration of gadoversetamide in the blood, and in patients with normal renal clearance accurate values can be obtained approximately 90 minutes following injection.
In patients with compromised renal function, clearance of gadoversetamide will be slowed and the interference with calcium determination by OCP prolonged.
Gadoversetamide does not affect other methods of measuring serum calcium, such as the arsenazo III colorimetric method, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy.
4.6 Pregnancy and Lactation
There is no clinical experience with the use of gadoversetamide during pregnancy.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Optimark should not be used during pregnancy except in cases where a contrast enhanced MR scan is determined to be critical, with no acceptable alternative imaging examination.
The degree of excretion of gadoversetamide in breast milk has not been studied in humans.
Based on animal studies, the rate of excretion is expected to be low.
At clinical doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated.
Optimark can be used during breast-feeding.
13 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Ambulant patients while driving vehicles or operating machinery should take into account that dizziness may incidentally occur.
4.8 Undesirable Effects
Most of the undesirable effects were of mild to moderate intensity and transient in nature.
The most common undesirable effects were dysgeusia, feeling hot, headache and dizziness.
The majority of adverse reactions observed after the use of gadoversetamide were found to be adverse reactions of the nervous system, followed by general adverse reactions, gastrointestinal disorders/ skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.
The following drug-related adverse reactions have been reported from clinical trials and from post- marketing use of gadoversetamide.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Serious adverse reactions have been reported and include anaphylactic reactions, cardiovascular reactions, and allergic respiratory disorders.
Treatment should be symptomatic and immediate access to necessary medicinal products and emergency equipment should be available should a serious event occur.
Local reactions have occurred at the injection site and may lead to local irritation type reactions.
Cases of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis have been reported.
4.9 Overdose
Gadoversetamide has been tested in humans in doses up to 700 micromol/ kg (seven times the standard dose).
Clinical consequences of an overdose have not been reported.
Acute toxicity symptoms are unlikely to occur in patients with normal renal function.
Dialysis can be used to remove gadoversetamide from the blood.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic Group:
Paramagnetic MRI contrast media, ATC code:
V08C A06
Gadoversetamide is a chelate containing gadolinium - which has paramagnetic properties and is responsible for the contrast enhancement effect in MRI - and the ligand versetamide.
The purpose of an MRI contrast agent is to induce signal intensity changes within the lesion thereby facilitating its recognition from the surrounding normal structures.
The use of a contrast agent may therefore reduce the threshold for lesion detection and visualization.
Gadolinium containing MRI contrast agents (gadolinium-based chelates) are designed to act indirectly on the local magnetic environment by altering proton T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times and at the usual concentration of 100 micromol/ kg, the T1 shortening predominates, and the T2 shortening is not significant using T1-weighted sequences.
Gadoversetamide, an extracellular gadolinium chelate, after intravenous administration, equilibrates rapidly within the extracellular fluid/ space and is eliminated primarily by glomerular filtration.
As a result of these characteristics, the timing of the image acquisition after contrast administration is critical in liver imaging.
For liver metastases, the signal difference between the tumour and surrounding liver tissue is significantly improved during the first 90 seconds after an extracellular
15 gadolinium contrast agent is administered.
Therefore, a rapid imaging sequence should be initiated 20 seconds after bolus injection of the contrast agent when the agent is predominately in the hepatic arteries and then again at 60 seconds after injection during the dominant portal venous phase.
Since the hepatic artery and portal venous system supply approximately 20% and 80% of the hepatic blood supply, respectively, the earlier (hepatic arterial phase) images provide optimal lesion conspicuity for hypervascular lesions and the portal venous phase images are useful for hypovascular lesions (most metastatic lesions are relatively hypovascular and are better demonstrated during the portal venous phase, manifesting as areas of lower signal intensity compared with the markedly enhanced liver).
Lesion conspicuity of hypo- and hypervascular lesions may be reduced if imaging is delayed more than 3 minutes due to the diffusion of the contrast agent into the interstitial spaces of both the liver parenchyma and lesion (e. g. metastasis) making the lesion isointense with the normal liver parenchyma.
Delayed post-contrast or equilibrium images (> 5 minutes after dosing) assist in the characterization of lesions, e. g. the centre of a metastasis may accumulate contrast in the interstitial space of the lesion and become hyperintense to the normal liver.
This difference in enhancement pattern is useful in formulating a differential diagnosis based on lesion characterization and diagnostic confidence.
The enhancement of brain tumours using a gadolinium (or iodine) containing contrast agent depends on the disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB).
As a result, these agents have been referred to as markers for sites of abnormal BBB breakdown.
When the BBB is disrupted, the gadoversetamide molecules diffuse into the interstitial compartment thereby producing the characteristic paramagnetic effect of T1 and T2 shortening.
In general, the addition of contrast to MRI, at the standard clinical dose of 100 micromol/ kg, has led to a significantly improved lesion detection, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Distribution The pharmacokinetics of gadoversetamide conforms to a two compartment open-model.
At the 100 micromol/ kg dose, the mean distribution half life in normal subjects calculated by the method of residuals in 12 normal volunteers is 13.3 ± 6.8 min.
Mean volume of distribution at the 100 micromol/ kg dose in non-renally impaired patients (including both normal subjects and patients with CNS or liver pathology) was 158.7 ± 29.0 to 214.3 (range 116.4 to 295.0) ml/ kg.
This volume of distribution (approximately 10-15 l for a body weight of 70 kg) is consistent with a medicinal product which distributes into the extracellular fluid.
Dose level has no consistent effect on the volume of distribution in any of the studies.
Gadoversetamide does not undergo protein binding in vitro.
Elimination The elimination half life at the 100 micromol/ kg dose ranges from 1.49 ± 0.15 h in healthy volunteers to 2.11 ± 0.62 h in non-renally impaired patients (including normal subjects and patients with CNS or liver pathology).
The mean plasma clearance of gadoversetamide in healthy subjects (111.0 ± 14.1 ml/ min/ 1.73m² BSA) is not significantly different from the mean renal clearance.
Similar results are obtained in normal subjects and patients with various combinations of liver, CNS and renal dysfunctions with renal clearance of gadoversetamide being approximately 95% of the total plasma clearance.
Such results (ratio renal clearance/ total plasma clearance close to 1) indicate that gadoversetamide is essentially cleared through the kidneys.
There was no systematic difference in any of the kinetic parameters as a function of dose level (100 to 700 micromol/ kg).
Therefore, within this dose range, the kinetics of gadoversetamide appear to be linear.
Metabolism The high accountability for the dose as intact complex in urine suggests that no significant metabolism of gadoversetamide occurs in humans.
16 Special Populations
Effect of Gender:
Adult male and female subjects were enrolled in two pharmacokinetic studies.
No significant differences in pharmacokinetics based on gender were identified.
Effects of Age:
When corrected for body weight, the total body clearance of gadoversetamide is greater in the 2 to 11 year age group (143 ± 27.9 ml/ h/ kg) than that observed in the 12 to 18 year age group (117 ± 26.1 ml/ h/ kg) and the two adult populations (82.1 ± 16.8 and 56.5 ± 9.7 ml/ h/ kg in the 19 to 64 and ≥ 65 year of age groups, respectively).
The elimination half life in the 2 to 11 and 12 to 18 year age groups (1.4 ± 0.3 and 1.6± 0.3 h-1, respectively) is shorter than that observed in the two adult populations (1.9 ± 0.5 and 2.5± 0.5 h-1 in the 19 to 64 and ≥ 65 year of age groups, respectively).
The number of elderly patients in whom the pharmacokinetics were determined was limited (over 65 years, N=3).
Effect of Renal Impairment Gadoversetamide plasma levels increase linearly with decreasing renal function; in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/ min) this even leads to a six-fold decreased gadoversetamide clearance and a corresponding six-fold increased extent of exposure AUC and t½.
Since gadoversetamide is only administered as a single dose this will lead to a longer and higher exposure for a limited duration.
Still, after 72 hours even in patients with severe renal impairment nearly the whole dose is recovered in the urine and in healthy populations up to 500 micromol/ kg doses were administered without safety issues.
Nevertheless, because of reported cases of NSF that may be associated with renal impairment for other gadolinium containing contrast agents and for gadoversetamide, Optimark should not be used in these patients.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute toxicity, reproductive toxicity, local tolerance, antigenicity, and genotoxicity.
No carcinogenicity studies were performed.
Repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs revealed vacuolation of the tubular cells of the kidneys, with strong evidence for reversibility of the effect.
No functional impairment was observed.

Further information
1.
WHAT Optimark IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Optimark is an injectable contrast medium.
It is used to make clearer diagnostic images of the brain, spine and of the liver, in adults and children.
As a result, it helps to clearly show abnormalities in the brain and spine, and in the liver.
This medicine is for diagnostic use only.
2.
BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN Optimark
Do not use Optimark if you are allergic (hypersensitive)  to the active substance gadoversetamide or  to any of the other ingredients of Optimark, or  to other gadolinium contrast agents
You should not be given Optimark if you suffer from severe kidney impairment, or if you are a liver transplant patient as use of Optimark in patients with these conditions has been associated with a disease called Nephrogenic Systemic fibrosis (NSF).
NSF is a disease involving thickening of the skin and connective tissues.
NSF may result in debilitating joint immobility, muscle weakness or impairment of the function of internal organs which may potentially be life threatening.
Take special care with Optimark Diagnostic procedures involving the use of contrast agents should be conducted under supervision of a physician with the prerequisite training and a thorough knowledge of the procedure to be performed.
Tell your doctor, if:  you suffer from allergies (e. g. medicinal products, seafood, hay fever, hives) or asthma  you had any reactions to previous injections of a contrast agent, including a previous history of reaction to iodine-based contrast agents  your kidneys do not work properly  Optimark is planned to be used in your child which is below the age of two years
35 Tell your doctor, if:  you are feeling thirsty and/ or if you have only had small quantities or nothing to drink before the examination  you have a cardiac pacemaker or any ferromagnetic implant (vascular clips, etc.) or a metallic stent in your body  you are taking a special kind of antihypertensive medicine, i. e. a beta-blocker  you have heart disease  you suffer from epilepsy or brain lesions  you are or your child is on a controlled sodium diet If any of these apply to you, your doctor will decide whether the intended examination is possible or not.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant and ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given Optimark.
Optimark can be used during breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines If you are an ambulant patient and plan to drive or use tools or machines, take into acount that dizziness may incidentally occur after you undergo a procedure involving the injection of Optimark.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Optimark This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of up to 17 ml, i. e. essentially ‘ sodium- free’.
Higher doses contain 1 mmol of sodium or more, which have to be taken into consideration if you are or your child is on a controlled sodium diet.
3.
HOW Optimark IS GIVEN
The usual dose The usual dose is about 14 ml injected over about 7 -14 seconds into a vein, usually a vein in an arm.
The injection is then flushed through with a saline injection to make sure none is left in the needle or tube used for the injection.
A second dose may be given within 30 minutes of the first injection.
Certain questions regarding treatment of a brain disease may require the injection of three times the usual dose in one injection.
The doctor will decide how much Optimark is needed for your examination.
You must tell the doctor or nurse/ technologist immediately if you feel pain around the area where the needle is placed.
If you are given more Optimark than you should have been If too much Optimark was injected it is unlikely that it will do you much harm, as much higher doses did not lead to any problems when some people received them.
If your kidneys are working normally it is unlikely you will have any problems.
Optimark can be removed using dialysis.
If you think you have been injected with too much Optimark, tell the doctor or nurse/ technologist immediately.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

38 The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
Therapeutic indications Optimark is indicated for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (CNS) and liver.
It provides contrast enhancement and facilitates visualization and helps with characterization of focal lesions and abnormal structures in the CNS and liver in patients with known or highly suspected pathology.
Special warnings and precautions for use As with any paramagnetic contrast agent, enhancement of MRI with Optimark may impair the visualization of existing lesions.
Some of these lesions may be seen on unenhanced, non-contrast MRI.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when contrast enhanced scan interpretation is made in the absence of a companion unenhanced MRI.
Before the examination, care must be taken that patients are sufficiently hydrated.
The usual contraindications of MR examinations must be applied, such as exclusion of patients with infusion pumps, pacemakers, ferro-magnetic clips etc.  Hypersensitivity Allergoid and other idiosyncratic reactions may occur with all contrast media for intravenous application, also with gadoversetamide, which could become manifest in form of cardiovascular, respiratory and skin reactions.
Most of these reactions occur within half an hour after administering the contrast medium.
As with all other contrast media of the same class, late reactions may occur (after hours or days) in rare cases; however, none were reported in the completed clinical trials.
If hypersensitivity reactions occur, the administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary.
During the examination, supervision by a physician is necessary and insertion of a flexible in-dwelling catheter is recommended.
To enable immediate action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products (e. g. epinephrine/ adrenaline, theophylline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and atropines), endotracheal tube and ventilator must be immediately available.
The risk of hypersensitivity reactions is increased in the following cases:
- patients with allergic predisposition
- patients with bronchial asthma; in these patients it is especially the risk of bronchospasm which is
increased
- patients with a history of reactions to contrast agents, including a previous history of reaction to
iodine-based contrast agents Before the injection of contrast media, patients should be asked whether they have any allergies (e. g. allergies to seafood or medicinal products, hay fever, urticaria), whether they are hypersensitive to contrast media and whether they have bronchial asthma.
Premedication with antihistamines and/ or glucocorticoids may be considered.  Patients taking beta-blockers It should be noted that patients using beta-blockers do not necessarily respond to the beta-agonists usually used for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions.  Patients with cardiovascular disease In this group of patients hypersensitivity reactions may be severe.
Especially in patients with serious heart diseases (e. g. severe heart failure, coronary artery disease) cardiovascular reactions may deteriorate.
However, these were not evident from clinical trials with Optimark.  Central nervous system disorders In patients suffering from epilepsy or brain lesions the likelihood of convulsions during the examination may be increased.
Precautions are necessary when examining these patients (e. g. monitoring of the patient) and the equipment and medicinal products needed for the rapid treatment of possible convulsions should be available.  Renal impairment and liver transplant patients There have been reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with use of some gadolinium-containing contrast agents in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30ml/ min/ 1.73m2), and in those who have had or are undergoing liver transplantation.
Therefore, Optimark should not be used in these populations.
Cases of NSF have also been reported in patients
39 with moderate renal impairment (GFR < 60ml/ min/ 1.73m2) with use of gadolinium-containing contrast agents.
Optimark should be used in these patients with caution.
Gadoversetamide is dialysable.
Haemodialysis shortly after Optimark administration in patients currently receiving haemodialysis may be useful at removing Optimark from the body.
There is no evidence to support the initiation of haemodialysis for prevention or treatment of NSF in patients not already undergoing haemodialysis.  Children Optimark must not be administered with an autoinjector.
The required dose should be administered by hand to children to avoid overdosage by mistake.  Neonates and infants Optimark should not be used in children below the age of two years.
Safety and efficacy have not been studied in this age group.  Sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose of up to 17 ml, i. e. essentially ‘ sodium- free’.
Higher doses contain 1 mmol of sodium or more, which should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet.  Serum iron and zinc Caution should be exercised because transient decreases in serum iron and zinc parameters have been observed in clinical trials.
The clinical significance of this is unknown.
Pregnancy and Lactation There is no clinical experience with the use of gadoversetamide during pregnancy.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Optimark should not be used during pregnancy except in cases where a contrast enhanced MR scan is determined to be critical, with no acceptable alternative imaging examination.
The degree of excretion of gadoversetamide in breast milk has not been studied in humans.
Based on animal studies, the rate of excretion is expected to be low.
At clinical doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated.
Optimark can be used during breast-feeding.
Posology and method of administration The agent should be administered as a bolus peripheral intravenous injection at a dose of 0.2 ml/ kg (0.1 mmol/ kg) body weight.
To ensure complete injection of the contrast medium, the injection should be followed by a 5 ml flush of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) injection.
The imaging procedure should be completed within 1 hour of administration of the contrast medium.
In cranial MRI, if a strong clinical suspicion of a lesion persists despite a single dose contrast- enhanced MRI or when more accurate information on the number, size or extent of lesions might influence management or therapy of the patient, in subjects with normal renal function, a second bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/ kg may be administered within 30 minutes of the first injection as it may increase the diagnostic yield of the examination.
The safety of repeat doses has not been established in children and adolescents, in patients with impaired renal function, or the elderly.
Limited data with other gadolinium contrast agents suggests that for the exclusion of additional cranial metastases in a patient with a known solitary resectable metastasis, an MR exam with the injection of 0.3 mmol/ kg body weight of Optimark may lead to higher diagnostic confidence.
Optimark is not recommended for use in children below the age of two years because the safety, efficacy, and impact of immature kidney function have not been studied in this age group.
Optimark has been studied in children of 2 years and older with a similar safety profile as shown in the adult population.
Insertion of a flexible in-dwelling venous catheter is recommended.
40 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No formal interaction studies have been performed.
Gadoversetamide has been shown to cause interference in the measurement of serum calcium using the ortho-cresolphthalein complexone (OCP) colorimetric method.
However, the administration of gadoversetamide does not cause a true decrease in serum calcium.
In the presence of gadoversetamide, the OCP technique produces an erroneous, low value for plasma calcium.
The magnitude of this measurement artefact is proportional to the concentration of gadoversetamide in the blood, and in patients with normal renal clearance accurate values can be obtained approximately 90 minutes following injection.
In patients with compromised renal function, clearance of gadoversetamide will be slowed and the interference with calcium determination by OCP prolonged.
Gadoversetamide does not affect other methods of measuring serum calcium, such as the arsenazo III colorimetric method, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy.
Special precautions for disposal and other handling Optimark is intended for single use only; any unused portions should be discarded.
Optimark pre-filled syringes should be used immediately.
Do not use the solution if it is discoloured or particulate matter is present.
If non-disposable equipment is used, scrupulous care should be taken to prevent residual contamination with traces of cleansing agents.
Pre-filled syringes:
Assembly and Inspection Inspect the syringe for signs of leakage.
Do not use if leakage is observed.
After screwing the push rod into the syringe piston, it is important to turn the push rod an additional ½ turn so that the grey piston rotates freely.
Prior to using the syringe, twist off grey tip cap and discard.
Syringe is now ready for needle or infusion tubing attachment.
Discard syringe and unused portion of the solution after use.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

1.
WHAT Optimark IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Optimark is an injectable contrast medium.
It is used to make clearer diagnostic images of the brain, spine and of the liver, in adults and children.
As a result, it helps to clearly show abnormalities in the brain and spine, and in the liver.
This medicine is for diagnostic use only.
2.
BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN Optimark
Do not use Optimark if you are allergic (hypersensitive)  to the active substance gadoversetamide or  to any of the other ingredients of Optimark, or  to other gadolinium contrast agents
You should not be given Optimark if you suffer from severe kidney impairment, or if you are a liver transplant patient as use of Optimark in patients with these conditions has been associated with a disease called Nephrogenic Systemic fibrosis (NSF).
NSF is a disease involving thickening of the skin and connective tissues.
NSF may result in debilitating joint immobility, muscle weakness or impairment of the function of internal organs which may potentially be life threatening.
Take special care with Optimark Diagnostic procedures involving the use of contrast agents should be conducted under supervision of a physician with the prerequisite training and a thorough knowledge of the procedure to be performed.
Tell your doctor, if:  you suffer from allergies (e. g. medicinal products, seafood, hay fever, hives) or asthma  you had any reactions to previous injections of a contrast agent, including a previous history of reaction to iodine-based contrast agents  your kidneys do not work properly  Optimark is planned to be used in your child which is below the age of two years
42 Tell your doctor, if:  you are feeling thirsty and/ or if you have only had small quantities or nothing to drink before the examination  you have a cardiac pacemaker or any ferromagnetic implant (vascular clips, etc.) or a metallic stent in your body  you are taking a special kind of antihypertensive medicine, i. e. a beta-blocker  you have heart disease  you suffer from epilepsy or brain lesions  you are or your child is on a controlled sodium diet If any of these apply to you, your doctor will decide whether the intended examination is possible or not.
