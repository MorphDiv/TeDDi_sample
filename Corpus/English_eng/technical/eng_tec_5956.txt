Autocorrection
Simple Autocorrection
Detect when a new sentence is started and always ensure that the first character is an uppercase character.
Convert & two uppercase characters to one uppercase and one lowercase character (e. g. PErfect to Perfect)
Detect when a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is typed and provide formatting that matches the way an Internet browser would show a URL.
& Suppress double spaces
Remove spaces at the beginning and end of paragraphs
Automatically do & bold and underline formatting
When typing '1) 'or similar in front of a paragraph, automatically convert the paragraph to use that numbering style. This has the advantage that further paragraphs will also be numbered and the spacing is done correctly.
Replace 1st... with 1^st...
When typing '* 'or '-' in front of a paragraph, automatically convert the paragraph to use that list-style. Using a list-style formatting means that a correct bullet is used to draw the list.
