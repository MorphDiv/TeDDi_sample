& kmines; is the & kde; version of the classic minesweeper game.
KDE
game
minesweeper
Introduction
Gametype:
Strategy, Board
Number of possible players:
One
& kmines; is the classic Minesweeper game. The idea is to uncover all the squares without blowing up any mines. When a mine is blown up, the game is over. Numbers indicate how many mines there are nearby.
How to Play
Objective:
Locate all the mines hidden on the minefield.
To play & kmines;, you need to use the mouse and its three buttons to uncover or to flag the squares (with two-buttoned mice, clicking the & MMB; is generally achieved by simultaneously pressing the & LMB; and the & RMB; buttons).
Clicking the & LMB; on your mouse will uncover a square. If there is a mine there, it will detonate, and the game will be over. If there is not a mine under the square, the square is cleared and if there are n't other mines nearby, the square will disappear including any nearby squares without mines. If there are mines nearby, a number will appear showing how many neighboring squares contain mines. For each square (excluding edge and corner squares), there are eight neighboring squares.
& LMB; clicking a flagged square is safe and does nothing.
The & RMB; will mark a square as containing a mine (by placing a red flag on it). Clicking the button twice will set it as being uncertain (by placing a question mark on it). The uncertain tag can be useful when you are puzzled about the positions of mines. The & MMB; will clear the surrounding squares if the right number of squares is already flagged. It is very useful since it is much quicker than uncovering all individual squares. Make sure your flags are correctly placed, if not, you might detonate a mine.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Rules
All the mines have to be cleared before a player can win a game.
The player cannot know the exact location of the mines before the game is over.
If a mine is detonated, the game is over.
Numbers will indicate nearby mines.
Strategies and Tips
Use the numbers to find out where nearby mines are.
Place flags where you suspect there are mines. Note that even though the indicated number of mines goes down when you place a flag, there might not be a mine under the flag.
Think before you click, a wrong click could detonate a mine.
When you suspect that a square contains a mine, work around the square to uncover any numbers which might help.
Try to clear the board as quickly as possible, the less time you spend, the higher your score will be.

How do I start a new game?
When you uncover a square, a number appears: it indicates how many mines surround this square. If there is no number the neighboring squares are automatically uncovered. When you find a square that you are sure contains a mine, it is very useful to put a flag on it (by right-clicking).
The left button will uncover a square. If there is a bomb below that square, the bomb will explode, and the game will be over.
If there is not a bomb under the square, a number will appear. That is the number of neighboring squares that contain bombs. Which ones? you ask: That's the point of the game.
For each square (excluding edge and corner squares), there are 8 neighboring squares.
If none of the neighboring squares has a bomb, then a blank will be shown under the square, and all neighboring squares will be automatically uncovered.
The right button will mark a square as containing a mine (by drawing a red flag on it) or, if the option is set, as being uncertain (by drawing a question mark on it). The uncertain tag can be useful when you are puzzled about the positions of mines.
The middle button will clear the surrounding squares if the right number of squares is already flagged. It is very useful since it is much quicker than uncovering all individual squares.
If your flags are not properly positioned, you will explode a bomb.
Pressing the yellow smiley will start a new game.
These are the default settings. The mouse buttons can be reprogrammed. For more information, see the section entitled Game Options.
The & kmines; Screen
The & kmines; Screen
The & kmines; Screen
The & kmines; screen consists of:
A Box showing you the number of mines still left to be marked. Every time you flag a bomb site, this number will decrease by one.
This box does not determine if you are right or wrong, but only how many mines you need to theoretically mark before you are done with this game.
In this example, there are 40 mines to be marked.
A Yellow Smiley Face. Clicking this will start a new game. If you lose the game, it will become a frown.
The box on the right shows how much time this round has taken. The shortest time for each level is listed as the high score.
The playing area. This will vary in size depending on the difficulty level of the game. In this example, it consists of 256 squares. This is where you play the game.
The options to & kmines; are set by selecting Settings Configure & kmines; from the menubar. This will bring up a dialog box.
kmines; Preferences
kmines; Preferences
This dialog box is divided into three sections.
The first option, labeled Enable? mark, determines whether you can mark squares as questionable. If this option is checked, then right clicking the mouse will first cause a square to be flagged. If you right click again on the same square, the flag will change to a?, to indicate you do n't know if there is a bomb there or not. If you click again, the square will change back to blank.
If there is not a mark in front of this option, the first right mouse click will change the square to a red flag. The second will make it blank again, thus skipping the? symbol.
The next option down, labeled Enable keyboard, determines if the keyboard shortcuts will work while playing the game. The default keyboard shortcuts are given in, and can be changed by selecting Settings Configure Shortcuts....
The only keyboard shortcuts affected are those responsible for playing the game. Keyboard commands such as New Game and Quit, still work, regardless of this option.
The Pause if windows loses focus option will automatically pause the game if the & kmines; window loses focus. When the game is paused, the gameboard disappears, so you cannot use pausing the game as a way to cheat!
The "Magic" reveal option switches on Magic reveal mode. In this mode, & kmines; does most of the gameplay for you: If you have uncovered enough squares to be able to tell with certainty that a square contains a mine, & kmines; will automatically mark it as a mine, and perform an autoreveal on squares for which it has marked the correct number of mines. Note that when you have this mode switched on, your scores do not count as highs cores.
The last section of this tab allows you to change the action of each of the three mouse buttons. Your options are:
Reveal
This will reveal the contents of the square. If there is no bomb, then a number will appear. If there is a bomb under that square, then the bomb will explode, and the game will be over.
Autoreveal
Clicking on a square with this button will automatically reveal all neighboring squares that are not marked with red flags. If one of those neighboring squares has a bomb under it, the bomb will explode, and the game will be over.
Toggle Flag
Clicking with this button on a square will cycle through blank, red flag, and question mark.
Toggle? Flag
Clicking with this button on a square will mark/ unmark with a question mark.
Appearance
The top three color buttons determine the Flag Color, Explosion Color and Error Color.
The rest of this page is concerned with mines colors. To adjust, simply click the color button beside each description, and select the new color.
Custom Game
Finally, if you are not finding the existing configurations challenging enough, you can set up a custom game here. Use the sliders to change the Width, Height, and the percentage of the board covered with Mines. The default game has 15 percent of the board covered, so there is plenty of room to make the game harder.
Saving your changes

If you want to abandon your changes, click Cancel to abort the changes.
If you click on Defaults, the default settings will be restored. Click OK to make these default changes permanent, or edit the settings some more.
