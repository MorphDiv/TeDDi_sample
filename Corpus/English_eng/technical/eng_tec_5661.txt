Quick Tips
- You can use upper and lower case; search is case-insensitive. - To search for optional terms, use OR. ex: George OR Ringo - To exclude search terms, use the minus symbol in front, such as -cats - When searching for a phrase, add quotes. ex: "There be dragons" - Add ext: type to specify a file extension, ex: ext: txt or ext: for none
Configuration
- Choose what folders and resources shall be indexed - or not. - Change the sort order and the number of shown results. - Define your own shortcuts to invoke the search dialog.
