EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
VOLIBRIS
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Volibris?
Volibris is a medicine containing the active substance ambrisentan.
It is available as tablets (pale pink, square:
5 mg; deep pink, oval:
10 mg).
What is Volibris used for?
Volibris is used for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to improve exercise capacity (the ability to carry out physical activity).
PAH is abnormally high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.
Volibris is used in patients with class II or III disease.
The ‘ class ’ reflects the seriousness of the disease: ‘ class II ’ involves slight limitation of physical activity and ‘ class III’ involves marked limitation of physical activity.
The effectiveness of Volibris has been shown in PAH with no identified cause and in PAH caused by connective tissue disease.
Because the number of patients with PAH is low, the disease is considered ‘ rare’, and Volibris was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 11 April 2005.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Volibris used?
Treatment with Volibris must be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of PAH.
The standard dose of Volibris is 5 mg once a day.
The tablets should be swallowed whole, with or without food.
A 10 mg dose may have a greater effect in patients with class III disease but this is associated with an increased risk of fluid retention and swelling.
Patients with PAH caused by connective tissue disease may also need to take 10 mg to get the best benefit from Volibris.
The dose should only be increased if the 5 mg dose is well tolerated.
Volibris is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years of age because of a lack of information on safety and effectiveness in this group.
In patients who have severe problems with their kidneys, treatment with Volibris should be started with caution, and a dose increase should be carried out with particular care.
Volibris should not be used in patients who have severe liver problems as it has not been studied in this group.
How does Volibris work?
PAH is a debilitating disease where there is severe constriction (narrowing) of the blood vessels of the lungs.
It causes high blood pressure in the vessels taking blood from the heart to the lungs.

The active substance in Volibris, ambrisentan, blocks the receptors for a hormone called endothelin, which causes blood vessels to constrict.
By blocking the effect of endothelin, Volibris allows the vessels to dilate (expand), helping to lower the blood pressure and improving symptoms.
How has Volibris been studied?
The effects of Volibris were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The effectiveness of Volibris was studied in two main studies involving a total of 394 patients with PAH, most of whom had class II or III disease (slight or marked limitation of physical activity).
The studies compared various doses of Volibris (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) with placebo (a dummy treatment).
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the distance the patients could walk in six minutes after 12 weeks of treatment.
This is a way of measuring the change in exercise capacity.
What benefit has Volibris shown during the studies?
Volibris was more effective than placebo at improving exercise capacity in patients with class II or III disease.
Overall, in the two studies taken together, patients taking Volibris at a dose of 5 mg once a day could walk an average of 44.6 m further after 12 weeks of treatment, from a baseline of around 345 m at the start of the study.
Patients taking placebo showed a reduction of 9.0 m after 12 weeks.
Patients with class III disease and those with PAH caused by connective tissue disease gained a greater benefit from the 10 mg dose than from the 5 mg dose.
What is the risk associated with Volibris?
The most common side effects with Volibris (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are headache (including sinus headache and migraine), peripheral oedema (swelling, especially of the ankles and feet) and fluid retention.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Volibris, see the Package Leaflet.
Volibris should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to soya, ambrisentan or any of the other ingredients.
Because it might be able to cause birth defects, Volibris should not be used in pregnant women or in women who could become pregnant unless they are using reliable contraception.
It should not be used in patients who are breast feeding, who have severe liver problems or who have high levels of liver enzymes in the blood.
Why has Volibris been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Volibris’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with PAH classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity.
The Committee recommended that Volibris be given marketing authorisation.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Volibris?
The company that makes Volibris will set up a study in the European Union (EU) looking at how the medicine is used once it is on the market.
It will also agree on a system in each Member State to control the distribution of Volibris, and will prepare information packs to make sure that health care workers, patients, and the male partners of female patients are provided with information on the medicine’ s side effects and the need to avoid pregnancy.

The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Volibris to Glaxo Group Ltd on 21 April 2008.
