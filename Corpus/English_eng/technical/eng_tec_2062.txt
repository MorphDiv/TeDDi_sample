Modifying Rows and Columns by Keyboard
Behaviour of rows/columns
options determine how the neighbouring elements are affected.
For example, you can only insert new rows and columns into a table with fixed row and column dimensions if space permits.
Note that these properties are valid only for changes to the column width that are made using the keyboard.
Using the mouse, you are free to make any column width changes.
Behaviour of rows/columns
options for tables in text documents, choose
Tools - Options - %PRODUCTNAME Writer - Table
, or use the
Fixed
,
Fixed/Proportional
, and
Variable
icons on the
Table
Bar.
There are three display modes for tables:
Fixed
- changes only affect the adjacent cell, and not the entire table.
For example, when you widen a cell, the adjacent cell becomes narrower, but the width of the table remains constant.
Fixed, proportional
- changes affect the entire table, and wide cells shrink more than narrow cells.
For example, when you widen a cell, the adjacent cells become proportionally narrower, but the width of the table remains constant.
Variable
- changes affect the table size.
For example, when you widen a cell, the width of the table increases.
