Functions
Choose a function in the lower part of the window.
These functions are also listed in the
context menu
of the
Commands
window.
Any functions not contained in the Formula Elements window need to be typed manually in the Commands window.
Formula Elements
window.
The icon next to the function indicates that it can be accessed through the Formula Elements window (menu View - Formula Elements) or through the context menu of the
Commands
window.
