ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
NutropinAq 10 mg/ 2 ml (30 IU) solution for injection
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
One cartridge contains 10 mg (30 IU) of somatropin* * human growth hormone produced in Escherichia coli cells by recombinant DNA technology.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Solution for injection.
NutropinAq is a solution for subcutaneous use.
The clear, colourless, sterile solution for multidose use is contained in a glass cartridge, closed with a rubber stopper and a rubber seal.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
- Long-term treatment of children with growth failure due to inadequate endogenous growth
hormone secretion.
- Long-term treatment of growth failure associated with Turner syndrome.
- Treatment of prepubertal children with growth failure associated with chronic renal
insufficiency up to the time of renal transplantation.
- Replacement of endogenous growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency of
either childhood or adult-onset etiology.
Growth hormone deficiency should be confirmed appropriately prior to treatment (see section 4.4).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Diagnosis and therapy with somatropin should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are appropriately qualified and experienced in the diagnosis and management of patients with the therapeutic indication of use.
The NutropinAq dosage and administration schedule should be individualised for each patient.
Dosage
Growth failure in children due to inadequate growth hormone secretion:
0.025 - 0.035 mg/ kg bodyweight given as a daily subcutaneous injection.
Somatropin therapy should be continued in children and adolescents until their epiphysis are closed.
Growth failure associated with Turner syndrome:
Up to 0.05 mg/ kg bodyweight given as a daily subcutaneous injection.
Somatropin therapy should be continued in children and adolescents until their epiphysis are closed.
Growth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency:
Up to 0.05 mg/ kg bodyweight given as a daily subcutaneous injection.
Somatropin therapy should be continued in children and adolescents until their epiphysis are closed, or up to the time of renal transplantation.
Growth hormone deficiency in adults:
2 At the start of somatropin therapy, low initial doses of 0.15 - 0.3 mg are recommended, given as a daily subcutaneous injection.
The dose should be adjusted stepwise, controlled by serum Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) values.
The recommended final dose seldom exceeds 1.0 mg/ day.
In general, the lowest efficacious dose should be administered.
In older or overweight patients, lower doses may be necessary.
Administration
The solution for injection should be administered subcutaneously each day.
The site of injection should be changed.
For instructions for use and handling, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Somatropin should not be used for growth promotion in patients with closed epiphyses.
Growth hormone should not be used in patients with active neoplasm.
NutropinAq therapy should be discontinued if evidence of tumour growth develops.
Growth hormone should not be initiated to treat patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open-heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental traumas or to treat patients having acute respiratory failure.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In adults with growth hormone deficiency the diagnosis should be established depending on the etiology:
Adult-onset:
The patient must have growth hormone deficiency as a result of hypothalamic or pituitary disease, and at least one other hormone deficiency diagnosed (except for prolactin).
Test for growth hormone deficiency should not be performed until adequate replacement therapy for other hormone deficiencies have been instituted.
Childhood-onset:
Patients who have had growth hormone deficiency as a child should be retested to confirm growth hormone deficiency in adulthood before replacement therapy with NutropinAq is started.
In patients with previous malignant disease, special attention should be given to signs and symptoms of relapse.
Patients with a history of an intracranial lesion should be examined frequently for progression or recurrence of the lesion.
NutropinAq is not indicated for the long-term treatment of paediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome, unless they also have a diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency.
There have been reports of sleep apnoea and sudden death after initiating therapy with growth hormone in paediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection.
The effects of growth hormone on recovery were studied in two placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 522 adult patients who were critically ill due to complications following open-heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental traumas, or who were having acute respiratory failure.
3 Mortality was higher (41.9% vs.
19.3%) among growth hormone treated patients (doses 5.3 - 8 mg/ day) compared to those receiving placebo.
The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients with acute critical illness in intensive care units due to complications following open-heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure receiving replacement doses for approved indications has not been established.
Therefore, the benefit-risk assessment for continuing treatment should be performed carefully.
Patients with growth hormone failure secondary to CRI should be examined periodically for evidence of progression of renal osteodystrophy.
Slipped capital femoral epiphyses and aseptic necrosis of the femoral head may be seen in children with advanced renal osteodystrophy and in growth hormone deficiency, and it is uncertain whether these problems are affected by GH therapy.
Physicians and parents should be alert to the development of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain in patients treated with NutropinAq.
Scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth.
Signs of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment.
However, growth hormone treatment has not been shown to increase the incidence or severity of scoliosis.
Because somatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity, patients should be monitored for evidence of glucose intolerance.
For patients with diabetes mellitus, the insulin dose may require adjustment after NutropinAq therapy is instituted.
Patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy.
Intracranial hypertension with papilloedema, visual changes, headache, nausea and/ or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin.
Symptoms usually occur within the first eight weeks of the initiation of NutropinAq therapy.
In all reported cases, intracranial hypertension-associated signs and symptoms resolved after reduction of the somatropin dose or termination of the therapy.
Funduscopic examination is recommended at the initiation and periodically during the course of treatment.
Hypothyroidism may develop during treatment with somatropin, and untreated hypothyroidism may prevent optimal response to NutropinAq.
Therefore, patients should have periodic thyroid function tests and should be treated with thyroid hormone when indicated.
Patients with severe hypothyroidism should be treated accordingly prior to the start of NutropinAq therapy.
Since somatropin therapy following renal transplantation has not been adequately tested, NutropinAq treatment should be terminated after that surgery.
Concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids inhibits the growth-promoting effects of NutropinAq.
Patients with ACTH deficiency should have their glucocorticoid replacement therapy carefully adjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth.
The use of NutropinAq in patients with chronic renal insufficiency receiving glucocorticoid therapy has not been evaluated.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Limited published data indicate that growth hormone treatment increases cytochrome P450 mediated antipyrine clearance in man.
Monitoring is advisable when NutropinAq is administered in combination with medicinal products known to be metabolised by CYP450 liver enzymes, such as corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, and cyclosporin.
4 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
For NutropinAq, no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Thus, the risk for humans is unknown.
Although animal studies do not point to a potential risk during pregnancy, NutropinAq should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs.
During pregnancy, maternal somatropin will largely be replaced by placental growth hormone.
It is not known whether somatropin is excreted in human milk, however, absorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is unlikely.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects of NutropinAq on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Somatropin has no known effect on the ability to drive or to use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Safety data from 9829 patients treated with Nutropin or NutropinAq - derived from a post-marketing surveillance survey in the United States - demonstrate that approximately 2% of patients have been shown to experience drug-related adverse reactions.
Most of these adverse drug reactions were reported in the “ general disorders and administration site conditions” system organ class.
The adverse reactions are listed in the table below, based on experience from clinical trials and a post- marketing surveillance survey.
Within the system organ classes, adverse reactions are listed under headings of frequency using the following categories: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000).

Investigations
Rare: renal function test abnormal
As with all medicinal products, a small percentage of patients may develop antibodies to the protein somatropin.
The binding capacity of growth hormone antibodies was lower than 2 mg/ l in NutropinAq subjects tested, which has not been associated with adversely affected growth rate.
Leukaemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficient patients treated with growth hormone.
A causal relationship to somatropin therapy is unlikely.
Patients with endocrinological disorders are more prone to develop an epiphysiolysis.
Indication-specific adverse drug reactions from clinical trials
Paediatric patients:
Patients with growth failure due to inadequate growth hormone secretion Common: central nervous system neoplasm.
Patients with growth failure associated with Turner syndrome Common: menorrhagia.
6 Patients with growth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency Common: renal failure, peritonitis, osteonecrosis, blood creatinine increase.
Children with chronic renal insufficiency receiving NutropinAq are more likely to develop intracranial hypertension.
The greatest risk is at the beginning of treatment.
Adult patients:
Adults with growth hormone deficiency Very common: paraesthesia.
Common: hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, insomnia, synovial disorder, arthrosis, muscular weakness, back pain, breast pain, gynaecomastia.
4.9 Overdose
Acute overdose could lead to hyperglycaemia.
Long-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms of gigantism and/ or acromegaly consistent with the known effects of excess growth hormone.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Somatropin and analogues, ATC Code:
H01 AC 01
Somatropin stimulates growth rate and increases adult height in children who lack endogenous growth hormone.
Treatment of growth hormone deficient adults with somatropin results in reduced fat mass, increased lean body mass and increased spine bone mineral density.
Metabolic alterations in these patients include normalisation of IGF-1 serum levels.
In vitro and in vivo preclinical and clinical tests have demonstrated that somatropin is therapeutically equivalent to human growth hormone of pituitary origin.
Actions that have been demonstrated for human growth hormone include:
Tissue Growth 1.
Skeletal growth: growth hormone and its mediator IGF-1 stimulate skeletal growth in growth hormone deficient children by an effect on the epiphyseal plates of long bones.
This results in a measurable increase in body length until these growth plates fuse at the end of puberty.
2.
Cell growth:
Treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and size of skeletal muscle cells.
3.
Organ growth:
Growth hormone increases the size of internal organs, including kidneys, and increases red blood cell mass.
Protein metabolism Linear growth is facilitated in part by growth hormone-stimulated protein synthesis.
This is reflected by nitrogen retention as demonstrated by a decline in urinary nitrogen excretion and blood urea nitrogen during growth hormone therapy.
Carbohydrate metabolism Patients with inadequate growth hormone secretion sometimes experience fasting hypoglycaemia that is improved by treatment with somatropin.
Growth hormone therapy may decrease insulin sensitivity and impair glucose tolerance.
Mineral metabolism
7 Somatropin induces retention of sodium, potassium and phosphorus.
Serum concentration of inorganic phosphorus are increased in patients with growth hormone deficiency after NutropinAq therapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth and increased tubular reabsorption in the kidney.
Serum calcium is not significantly altered by somatropin.
Adults with growth hormone deficiency show low bone mineral density and in the childhood-onset patient, NutropinAq has been shown to increase spine bone mineral density in a dose-dependent manner.
Connective tissue metabolism Somatropin stimulates the synthesis of chondroitin sulphate and collagen as well as the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline.
Body composition Adult growth hormone deficient patients treated with somatropin at a mean dosage of 0.014 mg/ kg bodyweight daily demonstrate a decrease in fat mass and increase in lean body mass.
When these alterations are coupled with the increase in total body water and bone mass, the overall effect of somatropin therapy is to modify body composition, an effect that is maintained with continued treatment.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
General characteristics
The pharmacokinetic properties of NutropinAq have only been investigated in healthy adult males.
Absorption:
The absolute bioavailability of recombinant human growth hormone after subcutaneous administration is about 80%.
Distribution:
Animal studies with somatropin showed that growth hormone localises to highly perfused organs, particularly the liver and kidney.
The volume of distribution at steady state for somatropin in healthy adult males is about 50 ml/ kg bodyweight, approximating the serum volume.
Metabolism:
Both the liver and the kidney have been shown to be important protein catabolising organs for growth hormone.
Animal studies suggest that the kidney is the dominant organ of clearance.
Growth hormone is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules.
It is then cleaved within renal cells into its constituent amino acids, which return to the systemic circulation.
Elimination:
After subcutaneous bolus administration, the mean terminal half-life t½ of somatropin is about 2.3 hours.
After intravenous bolus administration of somatropin, the mean terminal half-life t½β or t½ γ is about 20 minutes and the mean clearance is reported to be in the range of 116 - 174 ml/ h/ kg.
Available literature data suggest that somatropin clearance is similar in adults and children.
Characteristics in patients
Clearance and mean terminal half-life t½ of somatropin in adult and paediatric growth hormone deficient patients are similar to those observed in healthy subjects.
Children and adults with chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease tend to have decreased clearance compared to normal subjects.
Endogenous growth hormone production may also increase in some individuals with end-stage renal disease.
However, no somatropin accumulation has been reported in children with chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease dosed with current regimens.
Limited published data for exogenously-administered somatropin suggest absorption and elimination half-lives and time of maximum concentration tmax in Turner patients are similar to those observed in both normal and growth hormone deficient populations.
8 In patients with severe liver dysfunction a reduction in somatropin clearance has been noted.
The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The toxicity of NutropinAq has been tested in rats and monkeys and no findings of toxicological relevance were revealed.
Due to its hormonal activity, somatropin may exert a promotional effect on tumour growth in tumour- bearing subjects.
To date, this has not been confirmed in patients.
Local tolerance studies with NutropinAq showed no substantial adverse local reactions.
Studies in transgenic mice suggest a low antibody provoking potential of (aged) liquid Nutropin.
No common reproduction studies were performed.
However, long-term treatment of monkeys during pregnancy and lactation and of newborn animals until adolescence, sexual maturity and reproduction did not indicate substantial disturbances of fertility, pregnancy, delivery, nursing or development of progeny.

Further Information
1.
WHAT NutropinAq IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Somatropin has effects that are equivalent to human growth hormone of pituitary origin.
Growth hormone exerts significant effects directly on the production of other hormones, e. g.
IGF-1, and on metabolic actions.
The anabolic and growth-promoting effects of somatropin are to some part indirect effects mediated by IGF-1.
NutropinAq is indicated for:
• Long-term treatment of children with growth failure due to inadequate endogenous growth hormone secretion. • Long-term treatment of growth failure associated with Turner syndrome. • Treatment of prepubertal children with growth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency up to the time of renal transplantation. • Replacement of growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency originating in either childhood or adulthood.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE NutropinAq
Do not use NutropinAq
• If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to somatropin or any of the other ingredients of NutropinAq. • For growth promotion if growing is already finished. • If an active tumour arises.
Somatropin therapy should be discontinued if evidence of tumour growth develops. • During acute critical illness due to complications following open-heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or in case of acute respiratory failure.
24 Take special care with NutropinAq
• In patients with previous malignant disease, the doctor should give special attention to signs and symptoms of relapse. • In patients with a history of brain lesions, the patient should be examined frequently for a progression or recurrence of the lesion. • Children with Prader-Willi syndrome should not be treated with NutropinAq unless they are also suffering from growth hormone failure. • In patients with acute critical illness in intensive care units, the doctor should carefully evaluate the safety of continuing somatropin treatment. • If during growing a limp or hip or knee pain develops, please ask the doctor for advice. • Scoliosis may progress in any child during rapid growth.
Signs of scoliosis should be monitored during treatment. • In patients receiving NutropinAq, evidence of glucose intolerance should be monitored.
If the patient also has diabetes mellitus, please consult the doctor regularly during NutropinAq therapy.
The insulin dose may require adjustment after somatropin therapy is started. • This medicinal product contains 82 mg of sodium per cartridge.
To be taken in consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. • If symptoms like visual changes, headache, nausea and/ or vomiting occur, especially within the first eight weeks after starting somatropin therapy, please ask the doctor for advice. • In case of an untreated decrease of thyroid gland function (hypothyroidism), the optimal response to somatropin may be reduced.
Severe hypothyroidism has to be treated prior to start of NutropinAq therapy. • Since somatropin therapy following renal transplantation has not been adequately tested, growth hormone treatment should be terminated after that surgery. • Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone (ACTH) -deficient patients should consult the doctor regularly during growth hormone therapy.
The glucocorticoid replacement therapy may require adjustment after NutropinAq therapy has been started.
Using other medicines
• Concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids may reduce the growth-promoting effect of somatropin. • Because somatropin may reduce insulin sensitivity, patients with diabetes mellitus may require adjustment of their antidiabetic therapy. • During concomitant administration of somatropin with corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants or cyclosporin, please ask the doctor for advice.
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
NutropinAq therapy should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs.
It is not known whether somatropin is excreted in human milk.
However, absorption of intact protein from the gastrointestinal tract of the infant is unlikely.
Please ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
No studies on the effects of NutropinAq on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Somatropin has no known effect on the ability to drive or to use machines.

HOW TO USE NutropinAq
The diagnosis and management of somatropin therapy should be initiated and monitored by adequately experienced physicians.
The doctor will advise you about the individualised dose of NutropinAq.
Please do not change the dosage without consulting the doctor or pharmacist.
In general, the dosage will be calculated according to the following rules:
Growth failure in children due to inadequate growth hormone secretion:
0.025 - 0.035 mg/ kg bodyweight given as a daily subcutaneous injection.
Growth failure associated with Turner syndrome:
Up to 0.05 mg/ kg bodyweight given as a daily subcutaneous injection.
Growth failure associated with chronic renal insufficiency:
Up to 0.05 mg/ kg bodyweight given as a daily subcutaneous injection.
Somatropin therapy may be continued up to the time of renal transplantation.
Growth hormone deficiency in adults:
Low initial doses of 0.15 - 0.3 mg given as a daily subcutaneous injection.
The dose may be increased stepwise by the doctor according to the patient ’ s individual requirements.
The final dose seldom exceeds 1.0 mg/ day.
In general, the lowest efficacious dose should be received.
For older or overweight patients lower doses may be necessary.
NutropinAq is designed for use only with the NutropinAq Pen.
Please administer the prescribed dose of NutropinAq solution for injection subcutaneously each day and change the site of injection each time.
At the start of therapy it is recommended that a doctor or a nurse give the injection and train you with the appropriate NutropinAq Pen to use with your NutropinAq cartridge.
After training, the injection can be given by the patient or his/ her carer.
The medicine is supplied in a cartridge as a sterile solution with preservative for multiple use.
For each single injection please use a new, sterile injection needle.
Do not use the solution unless it is clear and not cloudy.
Please see also the instructions for use (on reverse).
Treatment with somatropin is a long-term therapy.
For further information please ask the doctor.
If you use more NutropinAq than you should
If more NutropinAq than recommended was injected, please consult the doctor.
Acute overdose could lead initially to a glucose decrease (hypoglycaemia) and subsequently to a glucose increase (hyperglycaemia).
Long-term overdose may result in an enhanced growth of ears, nose, lips, tongue and cheekbone (gigantism and/ or acromegaly).
These signs are consistent with the known effects of excess in human growth hormone.
If you forget to take NutropinAq
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
The prescribed dosage regimen should be continued.
If you stop using NutropinAq
A disruption or early ending of the treatment with somatropin may impair the success of the growth hormone therapy.
Please ask the doctor for advice before stopping the treatment.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
26 4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, NutropinAq can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
The common side effects reported were injection site reactions, headache, excessive tension of the muscles (hypertonia), subnormal activity of the thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), impaired glucose tolerance, loss of strength (asthenia) and development of antibodies to the protein somatropin.
An accumulation of fluids in the body with a mild transient swelling of the hands and feet (oedema), muscular pain (myalgia) and arthralgia (neuralgic pain in one or more joints) were seen very commonly in adult patients and commonly in children.
In patients with Turner syndrome, abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation was commonly reported.
In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, renal failure, peritonitis, bone necrosis, increase of creatinine blood levels were commonly reported.
Abnormal sensations (paraesthesia) were seen very commonly in adults with growth hormone deficiency.
These patients also reported the following common side effects: abnormally high levels of blood glucose, an excess of lipids in the blood, sleeplessness, joint disorders, arthrosis, muscular debility, back pain, breast pain and breast enlargement (gynaecomastia).
Other less common side effects have been reported:
Those occurring at the injection site: injection site atrophy, injection site haemorrhage, injection site mass and hypertrophy.
Metabolic disorders: decrease in blood glucose, increase in phosphate levels in the blood.
Nervous disorders: somnolence, rapid involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), personality disorder, vertigo.
Those related to the heart: abnormally rapid heart rate (tachycardia), high blood pressure.
Those related to the stomach: vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, feeling of sickness, and rarely diarrhoea.
Those affecting the skin: lipodystrophy (disturbed fat metabolism), skin atrophy, exfoliative inflammation of the skin, urticaria (allergic disorder marked by raised oedematous patches of skin or mucus membrane), excessive growth of hair on the face and body (hirsutism), skin hypertrophy.
Those related to the musculoskeletal system: decrease in muscle size (muscle atrophy), bone pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Those affecting the urogenital system: urinary incontinence, discharge of mucus from the vagina (leukorrhoea), excessive secretion of urine, urine frequency, urine abnormality, urine haemorrhage.
Other possible side effects: neoplasm, anaemia, papilloedema, diplopia.
Increased growth of birthmarks or moles (pre-existing naevi) may occur.
The doctor should be consulted as soon as possible if any changed appearance of the skin is noticed.
As with all protein medicines, in a few patients antibodies may develop to the protein somatropin.
Growth hormone antibodies with very low binding capacity have not been associated with adversely affected growth rate.
27 Leukaemia has been reported in a small number of growth hormone deficient patients treated with growth hormone.
A causal relationship to somatropin therapy is unlikely.
Symptoms of benign increased brain pressure (benign intracranial hypertension), which are papilloedema, visual changes, headache, nausea and vomiting, may occur more often in children with chronic renal insufficiency receiving NutropinAq.
Patients with endocrinological disorders are more prone to develop an epiphysiolysis.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

30 NutropinAq Pen Instructions for use with NutropinAq
DO NOT INJECT THE MEDICINE UNTIL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE HAS THOROUGHLY TRAINED YOU IN THE PROPER TECHNIQUES.
Caution:
Before using your NutropinAq Pen, please read the following instructions carefully.
We also suggest you consult your doctor or nurse for a demonstration.
The NutropinAq Pen is designed for use only with cartridges of NutropinAq (for subcutaneous use only).
As shown by the illustrations below, NutropinAq pen and cartridges are available in two designs (with or without additional yellow colour). The working of the pen and the content of the cartridges are the same for both designs.
Either of the NutropinAq cartridge designs can be used with either of the NutropinAq Pen designs.
Only use the pen needles recommended by your doctor or nurse.
The dosage scale located beside the window of the cartridge holder should not be used as a dose measurement.
It should only be used to estimate the dosage remaining in the cartridge.
Always refer to the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), not audible clicks, for setting an injection of NutropinAq.
The clicks are only audible confirmation that the black dose knob has been moved.
Always store the pen and cartridges in a clean, safe place in the refrigerator at a temperature between 2-8°C and out of children’ s reach and sight.
Protect from intense light.
Use a cooler to store your NutropinAq Pen when travelling.
The NutropinAq is designed to withstand a nominal (one hour maximum) period of time outside of the refrigerator on a daily basis.
Avoid areas of extreme temperature.
Check the expiry date of the cartridge before use.
To guard against the spread of infection, follow these safety measures:
• Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before using your pen. • Clean the cartridge rubber seal with an alcohol swab or cotton ball saturated with alcohol. • Avoid touching the cartridge rubber seal at all times. • If you accidentally touch the cartridge rubber seal, clean it with an alcohol swab. • Do not use the same needle for more than one person. • Use needles only once.
NutropinAq Pen Components:
31 Shown below are the items necessary for giving an injection.
Gather all of these components prior to use.
Your NutropinAq cartridge and Pen will be supplied separately.
Part I:
Preparing and Injecting
Follow the instructions in this section if you are using the pen for the first time or are replacing an empty cartridge.
Inspect all new cartridges prior to use.
Occasionally, after refrigeration, you may notice that small colourless particles are present in the NutropinAq solution.
This is not unusual for solutions containing proteins like NutropinAq and does not affect the strength of the product.
Allow the cartridge to come to room temperature and gently swirl.
Do not shake.
If the solution is cloudy or hazy or contains any solid matter, the cartridge should not be used.
Return the cartridge to your pharmacist or prescribing doctor.
1.
Remove the green pen cap and unscrew the cartridge holder from the pen.
If necessary, remove the empty cartridge and discard it properly.
2.
Press the white reset button.
3.
Turn the black dose knob counter-clockwise back to its starting position until it no longer turns.
(See illustration.) Then turn the dose knob clockwise until the first click position is reached (approximately 1/ 4 turn).
This ensures that the plunger push rod is reset to the starting position.
If this is not done when the dosage knob is first pushed in, NutropinAq will be wasted or the cartridge may crack.
4.
Insert cartridge into the cartridge holder, then screw the cartridge holder back onto the pen.
(Be careful not to touch the rubber seal.)
5.
Remove the paper seal from a new needle assembly and screw it onto the cartridge holder.
6.
Carefully remove both protective caps from the needle by pulling gently.
Do not throw the larger cap away as it will be used later for proper needle removal and disposal.
32 7.
Holding the pen with the needle pointing upward, gently tap the cartridge holder to move any air bubbles to the top.
While still holding the pen in the upright position, push in the black dose knob until it clicks into position.
You should see a drop of solution appear.
Be patient.
If medicine doesn’ t appear within a few seconds, you may need to push the reset button again.
8.
If no drop of medicine appears, push the white reset button again.
Now turn the black dose knob clockwise (See illustration) by one click (0.1mg).
If you accidentally turn it too far, go back one click (0.1 mg).
9.
While still holding the pen in the upright position, push in the black dose knob again and watch the needle tip for a drop of medicine to appear.
Repeat steps 8 and 9 until it appears.
10.
Press the white reset button.
11.
Set the required dose by turning the black dose knob.
If you cannot dial the full dose, either start a new cartridge (as described in Part I), or inject the partial dose.
Then, start a new cartridge (as described in Part I) to administer the remaining portion of your medication.
Your doctor or nurse will advise you on the procedure for administering the last dose in the cartridge.
Prepare the injection site by wiping with an antiseptic impregnated swab.
Injection sites include the upper arms, abdomen, and upper thighs.
Change the injection sites to avoid discomfort.
Even if you develop a preference for one site, you still should rotate the injection site.
Upper Arm
Abdomen
Thigh
12.
If you are using the passive shield (or no shield) proceed to step 13.
If you are using the active shield, slide the shield onto the pen and push the 2 black lock knobs on the needle shield toward the tip.
13.
Set the tip of the pen on the prepared injection site and press the needle into the skin by pushing the pen downward until the shield is totally depressed.
Your doctor or nurse will show
33 you how to do this.
Now you are ready to administer the dose.
Press down on the black dose knob.
Wait 5 seconds after the button is pushed, then withdraw the pen from the skin.
A drop of blood may appear.
Put a plaster on the injection site if you wish.
14.
Pull the needle shield off the pen (if you have used one) and place the larger needle cap on a flat surface.
Slide the needle in to pick it up and push the cap completely down over the needle.
Twist off the needle and discard it properly.
Your doctor or nurse will tell you how to dispose of the items you have used for the injection.
Always store your disposal container out of the reach of children.
15.
Attach the pen cap and return it to its case with the black dose knob pressed in.
You should always store the pen in a refrigerator.
Do not remove cartridge between injections.
DO NOT FREEZE.
For subsequent injections with the NutropinAq Pen, attach a new needle, push the white reset button and dial your dose.
Part II:
Storage and Maintenance
Follow these tips to ensure proper care of your NutropinAq Pen:
• Always keep your NutropinAq Pen and cartridge refrigerated and protected from light when not in use. • You may remove the pen and cartridge from the refrigerator up to 45 minutes prior to use. • Do not let your NutropinAq Pen and/ or cartridge freeze.
Contact your doctor or nurse for a replacement if either the pen or cartridge does not work. • Avoid excessive temperatures.
The solution in the cartridge is stable for up to 28 days after first use when stored at 2 - 8°C. • If your pen requires cleaning, do not place under water.
Use a damp cloth to wipe away dirt.
Do not use alcohol. • When priming a new cartridge, you may need to repeat Part I, steps 8 and 9 up to a total of 6 times (0.6 mg) to remove air bubbles.
Small bubbles may remain and will not affect the dose. • The pen should contain the NutropinAq that is being used.
Do not remove cartridge between injections. • The NutropinAq cartridge may be used for up to 28 days. • Do not store the NutropinAq Pen with needle attached.
Part III:
Needles for the NutropinAq Pen
Your doctor or nurse will recommend a needle that is appropriate for you.
Always use the needles recommended.
Needles from other countries may not fit on your NutropinAq Pen.
If you travel outside the European Union, make sure you take enough needles for the duration of your stay.
Part IV:
