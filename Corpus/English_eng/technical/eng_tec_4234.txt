openssl_error_string() returns the last error from the openSSL library.
Error messages are stacked, so this function should be called multiple times to collect all of the information.
Example 1. openssl_error_string() example
/ / lets assume you just called an openssl function that failed while( $msg = openssl_error_string()) echo $msg. "br / \n";
Note:
This function was added in 4.0.6.
