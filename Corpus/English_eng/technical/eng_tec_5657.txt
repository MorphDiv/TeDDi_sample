Overclocking
WARNING! Overclocking may make your system unstable and/ or cause data loss! It is even possible to destroy your graphics card or reduce its lifetime! ATI/ AMD's Overdrive(TM) disclaimer states: Overclocking to high/ maximum clock value cannot be guaranteed to work depending on the actual ASIC. Hard hangs, corruption, or application failures are valid results that may be observed if a higher clock value is set than the ASIC can handle. If you confirm this you accept that you are the only person responsible for your actions! Are you sure you want to enable overclocking?

ALERT The temperature of your graphics card has reached the alarm limit! This is a serious problem. The current temperature is %1 ºC. Overheating may reduce the lifetime of your graphics card or even destroy it. It is even possible to start a fire! You should investigate this IMMEDIATELY, and perhaps turn off your computer to allow the graphics card to cool. The overheating may be caused by a fan having stopped working effectively, either due to mechanical failure or an accumulation of dust, or from overclocking without adequate cooling. If you have not overclocked your graphics card then you should inspect its fan (if one is fitted). The following graphics cards are known to have fan issues: ASUS EAH4870: Fan control circuit dies during the first 6 months of operation (based on Internet reports.)
Temperature alarm!

Acknowledge
Welcome to the ATI GPU Monitor (KAtiMon) This is a KDE program for monitoring and controlling some aspects of your ATI graphics card. You can access KAtiMon by clicking on its system tray icon. Note that this program is NOT developed by ATI/ AMD: please do not send them any bug reports.
It seems that your graphics card does not have a fan, or that it is not possible to control it using the aticonfig tool. The fan controlling and monitoring capability of this program has been disabled. If this is incorrect, please send a bug report.
No fan
When this program exits it restores the fan speed to its original value (i. e. the speed that was set when the program was started). This only happens when you use the auto-fan speed feature, which is the default. If you want to set a specific fan speed, set it manually before closing the program. The fan speed will be restored to %1%.
Fan speed restoration
The current fan speed has been set manually. Normally, the program restores the fan to the speed at which it was originally operating when the program was started. Alternatively, you can keep your manual fan speed setting. Do you want to restore the original fan speed?

ATI Temperature Monitor, Fan Regulator and Overclocking Utility
Copyright (c) 2009 Stefanos Harhalakis
This is an utility that monitors and controls supported ATI graphics cards. It can: monitor temperature, fan speed, GPU speed and memory speed; auto-control fan speed by monitoring the temperature; act as an overclocking utility for cards that support it. Created with python, pyqt, pykde4 and pyqwt. Have fun using it and be careful when overclocking.
