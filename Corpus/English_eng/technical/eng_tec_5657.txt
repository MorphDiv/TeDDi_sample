Introduction
Gametype:
Dice, Arcade
Number of possible players:
Six
& kiriki; is an addictive and fun dice game for & kde;, designed to be played by as many as six players. Participants have to collect points by rolling five dice for up to three times per single turn. Each roll generates a specific combination of numbers which the player is free to either accept or decline. However, each specific combination of numbers can be accepted only once. After thirteen turns the game ends and the scores are compared. The player with the largest amount of points wins the game.
How to Play
Objective:
Earn more score points then either of the opponents.
Once & kiriki; starts, it right away gives out the first combination for the player one. If you are the player one, then it is now your turn, otherwise you will have to wait until all other players make their moves.
Note:
By default, unless the game settings have been changed, and in single player mode, the first player is controlled by human (you), while all other five players are controlled by Artificial Intelligence.
Once it is your turn, the first thing you should do is examine the current roll. Each of the five dice on the left hand side of the game screen has a specific value. Check the sequence to see if these values form any of the score patterns.
Keep in mind that the combination can match more than one score pattern. In this case you will have to determine which score pattern will result in greater points for you.
In case the current sequence matches no score pattern, or matches a score pattern you have already used up, you have two more rolls to fix the situation. To use your second (third) roll select the dice you are not satisfied with by clicking on them with your mouse and click the Roll button located right under the dice. This will cause the dice in question to reroll, thus changing their values.
After you have done the third reroll you must choose the score pattern which fits the dice sequence on hand. If none of the score patterns fit the sequence - you can either use Chance score pattern, or just select any score pattern on your scoreboard.
If you select a score pattern that does not fit current dice sequence, the score pattern you select will become void and of zero value.
As soon as you choose the score pattern its value updates to reflect the dice sequence you currently have.
Right after that your turn ends and the next participant’ s turn begins. This sequence repeats some thirteen times and then the game ends, the scores are calculated and the high scores are awarded.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Game Rules
& kiriki; score board is divided into fourteen different lines. Each line holds a single score pattern and the players' score earned for a roll matching the pattern. The score pattern of each line is calculated as follows: 1s: Sum of all dice valued ‘ 1’. Example: Dice on display: '14112 '. The sum is: '3'='1'+'1'+'1'. Dice on display: '51111 '. The sum is: '4'='1'+'1'+'1'+'1'. 2s: Sum of all dice valued‘ 2’. Example: Dice on display: '22422 '. The sum is: '8'='2'+'2'+'2'+'2'. Dice on display: '42322 '. The sum is: '6'='2'+'2'+'2'. 3s: Sum of all dice valued‘ 3 ’. Example: Dice on display: '34132 '. The sum is: '6'='3'+'3'. Dice on display: '33333 '. The sum is: '15'='3'+'3'+'3'+'3'+'3'. 4s: Sum of all dice valued ‘ 4’. Example: Dice on display: '14142 '. The sum is: '8'='4'+'4'. Dice on display: '41414 '. The sum is: '12'='4'+'4'+'4'. 5s: Sum of all dice valued‘ 5 ’. Example: Dice on display: '15155 '. The sum is: '15'='5'+'5'+'5'. Dice on display: '51555 '. The sum is: '20'='5'+'5'+'5'+'5'. 6s: Sum of all dice valued ‘ 6’. Example: Dice on display: '66616 '. The sum is: '24'='6'+'6'+'6'+'6'. Dice on display: '61616 '. The sum is: '18'='6'+'6'+'6'. Bonus if > 62: Player is awarded an additional 35 points if the summarized value of all the field above is greater than 62 points. Upper Total: It is not a playable field, but only a summary of all the fields above. 3 of a Kind: Summarized value of dice when three of the dice are bearing the same value. Example: Dice on display: '14121 '. The sum is: '9'='1'+'1'+'1'+'4'+'2'. Dice on display: '55151 '. The sum is: '17'='5'+'5'+'5'+'1'+'1'. 4 of a Kind: Summarized value of dice when four of the dice are bearing the same value. Example: Dice on display: '41444 '. The sum is: '17'='4'+'4'+'4'+'4'+'1'. Dice on display: '22522 '. The sum is: '13'='2'+'2'+'2'+'2'+'5'. Full House: 25 points are awarded to the player if the round results in three dice of a kind and a pair. Example: Dice on display: '11212 '. Dice on display: '53353'. Small Straight: 30 points are awarded to the player if the round results in four dice of sequential value. Example: Dice on display: '14312 '. The sequence is: '1', '2 ', '3', '4 '. Dice on display: '51643'. The sequence is: '3 ', '4', '5 ', '6'. Large Straight: 40 points are awarded to the player if the round results in five dice of sequential value. Example: Dice on display: '34152 '. The sequence is: '1', '2 ', '3', '4 ', '5'. Dice on display: '53264 '. The sequence is: '2', '3 ', '4', '5 ', '6'. kiriki;: 50 points are awarded to the player if the round results in five dice of the same value. You can score as many & kiriki; as you get, for each one after the first you get an additional turn at the end of the game. Example: Dice on display: '11111 '. Dice on display: '33333'. Chance: Summarized value of all the dice currently on display. Example: Dice on display: '51143 '. The sum is: '14'='5'+'1'+'1'+'4'+'3'. Dice on display: '21526 '. The sum is: '16'='2'+'1'+'5'+'2'+'6'. Lower Total: It is not a playable field, but only a summary of all the fields starting from '3 of a Kind 'and lower. Grand Total: It is not a playable field, but only a sum of'Upper Total' and'Lower Total 'fields. Other rules and constrains:
The entire game round is split into 13 turns.
Each player can do one to three rolls of dice per turn.
After the first roll is done, a player can perform additional rolls for up to two times (three rolls at all per turn).
The Player is not obligated to perform additional rolls if the first roll brings satisfactory results.
Each additional roll may either involve all the dice, or only the selected ones.
A Player can select the dice to be recast by clicking on them with the mouse.
Once the dice have been recast their previous value is lost and only the new value is valid.
The result of the roll is considered satisfactory if the values of the dice on display can be put into one of the score patterns discussed above.
Each individual score pattern can only be used once per game per player. Therefore, once the score pattern has been used by one player it can no longer be used by that same player. However, another player can still use it, unless he has used this same pattern up already.
