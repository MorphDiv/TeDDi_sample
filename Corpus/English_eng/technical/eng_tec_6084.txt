Currently used file name schemes
Here you can see the currently configured file name schemes which the "Suggest" button in the tag editor uses to extract tag information from a file name. Each string may contain one of the following placeholders: %t: Title %a: Artist %A: Album %T: Track %c: Comment For example, the file name scheme "[%T] %a - %t" would match "[01] Deep Purple - Smoke on the water" but not "(Deep Purple) Smoke on the water". For that second name, you would use the scheme "(%a) %t". Note that the order in which the schemes appear in the list is relevant, since the tag guesser will go through the list from the top to the bottom, and use the first matching scheme.
Move scheme up
