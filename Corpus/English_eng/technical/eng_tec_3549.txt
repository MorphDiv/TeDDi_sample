(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
ldap_close() closes the link to the LDAP server that's associated with the specified link_identifier.
This call is internally identical to ldap_unbind().
The LDAP API uses the call ldap_unbind(), so perhaps you should use this in preference to ldap_close().
Note:
This function is an alias of ldap_unbind().
