4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Pigs (gilts and sows).
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
Passive immunisation of piglets via the colostrum, after active immunisation of sows and gilts, to reduce lesions in lymphoid tissues associated with PCV2 infection and as an aid to reduce PCV2- linked mortality.
Duration of immunity: up to 5 weeks after transfer of passive antibodies through colostrum intake.
4.3 Contraindications
None.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Vaccinate only healthy animals.
Apply usual procedures for the handling of animals.
Apply usual aseptic procedures.
2 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
To the user:
This product contains mineral oil.
Accidental injection/ self injection may result in severe pain and swelling, particularly if injected into a joint or finger, and in rare cases could result in the loss of the affected finger if prompt medical attention is not given.
If you are accidentally injected with this product, seek prompt medical advice even if only a very small amount is injected and take the package leaflet with you.
If pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination, seek medical advice again.
To the physician:
This product contains mineral oil.
Even if small amounts have been injected, accidental injection with this product can cause intense swelling, which may, for example, result in ischaemic necrosis and even the loss of a digit.
Expert, PROMPT, surgical attention is required and may necessitate early incision and irrigation of the injected area, especially where there is involvement of finger pulp or tendon.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Slight and transient local reactions normally occur after the administration of one dose of vaccine, mainly swelling (up to 2 cm2 in average) and redness (up to 3 cm2 in average), and in some cases oedema (up to 17 cm2 in average).
These reactions resolve spontaneously in maximum 4 days in average without any consequence on the health and the zootechnical performances.
In clinical studies, the post-mortem examination of the injection sites performed at most 50 days after the vaccination revealed limited lesions such as a discoloration and a granuloma in the majority of animals, as well as necrosis or fibrosis in approximately half of the animals.
Within the 2 days following the injection, an average increase in rectal temperature of up to 1.4°C can occur.
Rarely, an increase in rectal temperature of higher than 2.5°C, lasting less than 24 hours, may occur.
In rare cases, slight apathy or reduction in appetite may be observed, which should resolve spontaneously.
Vaccination may exceptionally cause hypersensitivity reactions.
In such cases, an appropriate symptomatic treatment should be provided.
Exceptionally abortion may occur after vaccination.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Can be used during pregnancy.
Use during lactation – not applicable.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy from the concurrent use of this vaccine with any other.
It is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered concurrently within 14 days before or after vaccination with the product.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Reconstitute immediately after removal from the refrigerator (or other cold storage).
3 To use the vaccine, shake vigorously the vial of antigen suspension and inject its content into the vial of emulsion containing adjuvant.
Gently mix before use.
The reconstituted vaccine is a homogeneous white emulsion.
Administer one 2 ml dose by deep intramuscular injection in accordance with the following vaccination scheme:
Basic vaccination: • Gilts:
One injection, followed 3 to 4 weeks later by a second injection, at least 2 weeks before mating.
One further injection must be given, at least 2 weeks before farrowing. • Sows:
One injection, followed 3 to 4 weeks later by a second injection, at least 2 weeks before farrowing.
Revaccination: • One injection at each gestation, at least 2 to 4 weeks before farrowing.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
No adverse reactions except those mentioned in section 4.6 were observed after the administration of a double dose of vaccine.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Zero days.
5.
