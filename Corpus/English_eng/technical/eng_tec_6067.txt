A visual guide to & kde; 's interface. This is a very early version of the document. Eventually, this will be a graphical tour of & kde;.

& kde; Visual Dictionary of terms
This project was started to help unify the vocabulary used in & kde; documentation.
We provide this for you here as an aid to learning your way around the & kde; Graphical User Interface. These names have been standardized within & kde; documentation, so that you will always find interface items referred to in the same way.
The term Widget refers to the basic building block of a computer program's interface.
Each widget operates in a similar manner each time it is used, but the effect that the widget has depends on its place within the program.
Listing of Common & kde; Widgets
Currently, this guide consists of a table of the names of the graphical elements often found in & kde; documentation, and an example of each one.
Our hope, eventually, is to make this a much more complete document, which will take you on a visual tour of & kde;.
