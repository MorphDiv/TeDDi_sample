Converting 2-D Objects to Curves, Polygons, and 3-D Objects
You can convert two dimensional (2-D) objects to create different shapes. $[officename] can convert 2-D objects to the following object types:
Curved object based on BÃ©zier curves
Polygon object consisting of straight line segments
3-D object with shading and a light source
3-D rotation object with shading and a light source
To convert an object to a curved shape:
Select a 2-D object on the slide or page.
Convert - To Curve
.
Points

on the
Drawing
toolbar, and drag the handles of the object.
You can also drag the control points of a handle to modify the shape of the curve.
To convert a 2-D object to a polygon:
Select a 2-D object on the slide or page.
Convert - To Polygon.
Points

on the
Drawing

To convert a 2-D object to a 3-D object:
Select a 2-D object on the slide or page.
Extrusion On/Off

on the
Drawing
bar, or right-click the object and choose

To convert a 2-D object to a 3-D rotation object:
A 3-D rotation object is created by rotating the selected object around its vertical axis.
Select a 2-D object on the slide or page.
Convert - To 3-D Rotation Object
To edit the properties of the 3-D object, use the Line and Filling toolbar and the 3-D Settings toolbar.
You can rotate the 2-D object before converting it to create a more complex shape.
