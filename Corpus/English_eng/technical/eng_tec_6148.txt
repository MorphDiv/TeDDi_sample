Questions and Answers
I have installed & kde; 3, but & knode; does not exist in the K Menu.
Does the Internet entry exist? If not, maybe the kdenetwork package is n't installed (perhaps because your distribution possibly does n't do this for you); if the entry is there, but you do not have a KNode item in it, you should try to open a & konsole; and run & knode; from there. Type
% knode &
If an error message appears that tells you that & knode; could not be started or found please check whether the file knode exists in $KDEDIR / bin and that its permissions are correctly set.
When I start & knode;, a message appears in the task bar but suddenly disappears without & knode; being started.
Try to start & knode; from the & konsole; (see previous question) and keep attention for the messages displayed there: if they do not make sense to you mark them with your mouse and copy it to the clipboard; then, ask for help on one of the & kde; mailing lists or & kde; news groups.
I need an important article, but & knode; does n't have it any more; where can I find this article?
You can find some extensive usenet archives at groups. google. com or AltaVista; they even contain articles that are several years old.
How do I open and read several articles at the same time?
Open the article with Open in own window.
My articles do not appear in the newsgroup.
When you publish an article it may be some time until your news server has it; wait several hours before you send the article again.
I want to keep an article; how do I archive it?
Choose the article in the article view and then use File Save to open a file dialog; you can then save the article to a file. Another possibility is to copy the article to a folder.
Some set headers do not appear for several articles in the article window; am I doing something wrong?
This is not unusual because many headers are optional and often not contained in articles; in this case & knode; does not show those header lines.
Sometimes I see an article which refers to other articles but & knode; does not show any references; why is that?
This happens when somebody posted an article in another news group and checked the option Followup To; the article in question is then sent to your news group, but the referring article is absent. In many cases the poster tells the reason for his choice to set a followup.
When I want to answer an article an error message appears telling me that the external editor could not be started, but the editor is correctly set.
Have a look whether you entered the place-holder for a filename after the editor command; if not, enter it. If you want, for example, to use & kedit; enter kedit %f
If the %f is absent, your editor cannot be run.
Why can I not receive data from my local news server?
If you use & knode; together with with a local news server, you must make sure that this server is correctly set up and started; for further details, please consult the documentation of your local news server.
The availability of the local news server can easily be verified with the telnet program: open a console and type:
% telnet localhost nntp
Followed by that, the news server should respond with:
Trying 127.0.0.1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^] '. 200 Leafnode NNTP Daemon, version 1.9.16 running at konqi. org
You can quit the telnet session with:
% quit
If that does not work there is either no local news server set up or the server was not started; in this case, please consult the documentation of your local news server.
If you are trying to connect to a news server on the Internet you need, of course, an open (dial-in) connection and to have set up & knode; to use your ISP's news server; your ISP should be able to give you information about which news servers you can use.
