Defines the settings for importing HTML documents.
Use 'English (USA)' locale for numbers
When importing numbers from an HTML page, the decimal separator and the thousands separator characters differ according to the locale of the HTML page.
The clipboard however contains no information about the locale.
For example, the characters &quot; 1.000 &quot; copied from a German Web page most possibly mean &quot; one thousand &quot; because the dot-on-the-line is the thousands separator in a German locale.
If copied from an English Web page, the same characters stand for the number 1 as in &quot; one dot zero zero zero &quot; .
