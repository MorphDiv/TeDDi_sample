& filelight; creates an interactive map of concentric segmented-rings that helps visualize disk usage on your computer.

Introduction
& filelight; 1.9 Screenshot
Screenshot
& filelight; allows you to quickly understand exactly where your diskspace is being used by graphically representing your file system as a set of concentric segmented-rings. You can use it to locate hotspots of disk usage and then manipulate those areas using & konqueror;.
Configuring & filelight;
The & filelight; settings dialog has two tabs for configuring the & filelight; options. The two tabs are Scanning and Appearance. Below is a description of the settings tabs. The & filelight; settings dialog can be found by clicking Settings Configure Filelight.
Scanning
Scanning Screenshot
The scanning tab allows you to configure how & filelight; scans folders. The Do not scan these folders: is used to excluded certain folders from your scan. This option is very useful for skipping folders that you may not have permissions to read, or folders that are part of a virtual filesystem, such as / proc. To add a folder to the list, click the Add... button, this will start a dialog where you can choose the folder of your choice from a tree view. To remove a folder simply select the folder of your choice and click the Remove button.
Appearance
Appearance Screenshot
The Appearance tab allows you to configure the way & filelight; looks.
The Scheme section is used to choose a color scheme for & filelight;. The color schemes are Rainbow, & kde; Colors, and High Contrast. There is also a Contrast: slider to adjust the contrast of the ring segments for easier viewing.
The Use anti-aliasing check box is used to enable the use of anti-aliasing in the & filelight; view. Selected, this option makes the ring segments have a much cleaner look.
The Vary label font sizes check box is useful when you have files or folders with long names. This option will change the size of the font to allow it to fit in the view better. When this option is enabled a Minimum font size: spinbox becomes available for choosing the smallest size font to scale to.
The Show small files option is disabled by default as small files tend to clutter the & filelight; view. Enable this option if you would like to have your small files included in the & filelight; view.
Using & filelight;
Starting & filelight;
& filelight; can be started from the K-Menu, or from the command-line
From the K-Menu
Open the & kde; program menu by clicking on the big K icon on your panel. This will raise the program menu. Move your cursor up the menu to the Utilities menu item. Choose filelight;.
From the Command Line
You can start & filelight; by typing its name on the command line. If you give it a folder name, as in the example below, it will scan that folder.
% filelight / home
Scanning folders
Scanning a folder shows it's contents as a filemap. To scan a folder, use the scan menu, or type a & URL; straight into the location bar.
Exploring Filemaps
Once a scan has completed you will be presented with a filemap that represents the folder you scanned. The filemap is a series of segmented-rings that expand from the center. Brightly colored segments are folders, gray segments are files. Segments are sized in proportion to their filesize. Segments can be nested, so for example, / home/ mxcl will be one level outwards and within the bounds of the segment representing / home. Segments are labeled and hovering the mouse over segments will give you more details of that segment and its child segments.
Filemap Screenshot
You can open folders with & konqueror; or & konsole; using the context menu for that segment. & MMB; clicks open files by mimetype, & eg; images with Gwenview. You can right click the central circle to get a context menu for the scanned folder. Left clicking segments will re-center the map on that segment.
If you want to improve the documentation, I'll happily accept patches. Thanks.
