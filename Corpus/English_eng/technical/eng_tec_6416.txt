ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
WebDAV is a D istributed A uthoring and V ersioning protocol for the World Wide Web. It allows for easy management of documents and scripts on a http server, and has additional features designed to simplify version management amongst multiple authors.
Usage of this protocol is simple. Type the location you want to view, similar to a http URL except for the webdav: / / protocol name at the start. An example is webdav: / / www. hostname. com/ path/. If you specify a folder name, a list of files and folders will be displayed, and you can manipulate these folders and files just as you would with any other filesystem.
WebDAV Features
Locking
File locking allows users to lock a file, informing others that they are currently working on this file. This way, editing can be done without fear that the changes may be overwritten by another person who is also editing the same document.
Source file access
WebDAV allows access to the script which is called to produce a specific page, so changes can be made to the script itself.
Per-document property support
Arbitrary properties may be set to assist identification of a document, such as the author.
To take advantage of these additional capabilities, you will need an application which supports them. No application currently supports them through this kioslave.
WebDAVS is the WebDAV protocol encrypted via SSL.
