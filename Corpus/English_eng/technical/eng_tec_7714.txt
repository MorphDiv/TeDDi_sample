EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
INVANZ
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is INVANZ?
INVANZ is a vial containing a white powder which is dissolved before use to make up a solution for infusion (drip into a vein).
INVANZ contains the active substance ertapenem.
What is INVANZ used for?
INVANZ is an antibiotic.
It is used to treat infections such as infections of the abdomen, community- acquired pneumonia (infection of the lungs – community-acquired means that when the infection has been caught outside of hospital), gynaecological infections, and foot infections in diabetic patients.
INVANZ can be used in adults and children (from the age of 3 months).
INVANZ is used when the bacteria (germs) that cause these infections are likely to be killed by the antibiotic.
Before using INVANZ, doctors need to look at any official guidance they may have on the appropriate use of antibiotics.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is INVANZ used?
When given to adults and adolescents, INVANZ is given as 1 gram once a day.
For younger patients (3 months to 12 years), it is given twice a day, and the dosage is based on the weight of the patient (15 mg/ kg bodyweight).
The infusion should last 30 minutes.
The treatment lasts between 3 and 14 days, depending on the type and the severity of the infection.
Once the infection has improved, the patient’ s treatment can be switched to an oral antibiotic.
Patients with severe renal problems, including those on dialysis, should not be given INVANZ.
How does INVANZ work?
The active substance in INVANZ, ertapenem, is an antibiotic belonging to the group of the ‘ carbapenems’.
It acts by binding to some proteins on the surface of the cells of the bacteria.
This upsets the essential functions that keep the cell alive, and kills the bacteria.
The list of bacteria against which INVANZ is active can be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics.
How has INVANZ been studied?
The effects of INVANZ were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The use of INVANZ in the treatment of infections in adults was compared to that of other antibiotics: it was compared with ceftriaxone in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; 866 patients) and urinary tract infections (592 patients), and with a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam in abdominal 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

The studies in children were in the same types of infections, and the comparators were ceftriaxone (CAP; 389 children) and ticarcillin/ clavulanate (intra-abdominal infections; 105 children).
The studies generally examined if the infection was cured in the days following treatment (Test of Cure – 7 to 28 days after treatment depending on the type of infection).
What benefit has INVANZ shown during the studies?
INVANZ was as effective as ceftriaxone or piperacillin/ tazobactam in abdominal infections, community-acquired pneumonia, gynaecological infections and diabetic foot infections: the same cure rates were reached for both INVANZ and the comparator medicine (between 87 and 94% for INVANZ, against 83 to 92% for the comparators).
However, the data presented were not sufficient to support the use of INVANZ in the treatment of urinary tract infections and skin and soft tissue infections, except diabetic foot ulcers.
In children, its effectiveness was comparable to that of the comparators, and to the effectiveness seen in adults.
What is the risk associated with INVANZ?
The main side effects of INVANZ (seen in 1 to 10 patients in 100) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, rash (including nappy rash in children), itching, problems at the site where the medicine was injected (including pain).
INVANZ also has an effect on some blood tests.
For the full list of all side effects reported with INVANZ, see the Package Leaflet.
INVANZ should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ertapenem or any of the other ingredients, or to other antibiotics of the same group (carbapenems).
Its use should also be avoided in patients who are severely allergic to other types of antibiotics, such as penicillins or cephalosporins.
Why has INVANZ been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the INVANZ had shown its effectiveness, albeit with a limited number of severe cases treated during the trials, in the treatment of abdominal infections, community-acquired pneumonia, gynaecological infections, and diabetic foot infections.
They concluded that it also was effective in children.
They decided that INVANZ’ s benefits are greater than its risks and they recommended that INVANZ be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about INVANZ:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for INVANZ to Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited on 18 April 2002.
