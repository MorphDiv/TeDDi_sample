Migrating from PHP 3 to PHP 4

Recent operating systems provide the ability to perform versioning and scoping.
This features make it possible to let PHP 3 and PHP 4 run as concurrent modules in one Apache server.
This feature is known to work on the following platforms:
Linux with recent binutils (binutils 2.9.1.0.25 tested)
Solaris 2.5 or better
FreeBSD (3.2, 4.0 tested)
To enable it, configure PHP3 and PHP4 to use APXS (--with-apxs) and the necessary link extensions (--enable-versioning).
Otherwise, all standard installations instructions apply.
For example:
$. / configure\ --with-apxs= / apache / bin / apxs\ --enable-versioning\ --with-mysql\ --enable-track-vars
