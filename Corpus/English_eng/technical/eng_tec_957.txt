The following files and directories are contained within the OpenDocument files:

.
content.xml
is stored without formatting elements like indentation or line breaks to minimise the time for saving and opening the document.
On the
Tools - Options - Load/Save - General
tab page you can activate the use of indentations and line breaks by unmarking the
Size optimisation for ODF format

meta.xml
