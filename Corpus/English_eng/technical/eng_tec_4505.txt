(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
pg_select() selects records specified by assoc_array which has field= value.
For successful query, it returns array contains all records and fields that match the condition specified by assoc_array.
If options is specified, pg_convert() is applied to assoc_array with specified option.
Example 1. pg_select
?php $db = pg_connect ('dbname=foo'); / / This is safe, since $_POST is converted automatically $rec = pg_select($db, 'post_log', $_POST); if ($rec) {echo "Records selected\n"; var_dump($rec);} else {echo "User must have sent wrong inputs\n";}?
Note:
This function is experimental.
