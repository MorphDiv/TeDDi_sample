EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
KIOVIG
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Kiovig?
Kiovig is a solution for infusion (drip into a vein).
It contains the active substance human normal immunoglobulin.
What is Kiovig used for?
Kiovig is used in three main groups of patients: • Patients who are at risk of infection because they do not have sufficient antibodies (proteins naturally found in the blood that help the body to fight infections and other diseases).
These can be people who are born with a lack of antibodies (primary immunodeficiency syndrome, PID).
It also includes patients whose lack of antibodies is due to a cancer of the blood (myeloma or chronic lymphoid leukaemia), or children born with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), who suffer from frequent infections.
These types of conditions are called ‘ immunodeficiency syndromes’ and their treatment is called ‘ replacement therapy ’. • Patients with certain immune disorders.
These patients have an abnormal immune system (the body’ s defence system) that needs to be adjusted.
They include patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who do not have enough platelets (components in the blood that help it to clot), and who are at high risk of bleeding, and patients with certain diseases (Guillain- Barré syndrome or Kawasaki disease).
This type of treatment is called ‘ immunomodulation’ (immune adjustment). • Patients who have had a bone marrow transplant.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Kiovig used?
Kiovig is usually given as an intravenous infusion by a doctor or nurse.
The dose and frequency of infusions (how often it is given) depend on the disease being treated.
In replacement therapy, the dose may need to be adjusted for patients depending on their response.
Kiovig can be diluted before administration.
For full details, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (also part of the EPAR).
How does Kiovig work?
The active substance in Kiovig, human normal immunoglobulin, is a highly purified protein extracted from human plasma (part of the blood).
It contains immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is a type of antibody.
IgG has been used as a medicine since the 1980s and has a wide range of activity against 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

Kiovig works by restoring abnormally low IgG levels to their normal range in the blood.
At higher doses, it can help to adjust an abnormal immune system and modulate the immune response.
How has Kiovig been studied?
As human normal immunoglobulin has been used to treat these diseases for some time, and in accordance with current guidelines, only two small studies were needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of Kiovig in patients.
In the first study, Kiovig was used as replacement therapy in 22 patients with PID who had very low or no levels of immunoglobulin.
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of serious bacterial infections and the amount of antibiotic used.
The second study looked at using Kiovig for immunomodulation in 23 patients with ITP.
The main measure of effectiveness was the increase in platelets.
What benefit has Kiovig shown during the studies?
In the first study, Kiovig was as effective as the standard treatment in preventing infections and reducing antibiotic use.
In the second study, Kiovig was shown to be effective in increasing the platelet count.
What is the risk associated with Kiovig?
The most common side effects with Kiovig (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are headache and pyrexia (fever).
Some side effects are more likely to occur when using a high rate of infusion, in patients with low immunoglobulin levels, or in patients who have not received Kiovig before or for a long time.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Kiovig, see the Package Leaflet.
Kiovig should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human normal immunoglobulin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are allergic to other types of immunoglobulin, especially where they have deficiency (very low levels) of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and they have antibodies against IgA.
Why has Kiovig been approved?
According to current guidelines, medicines that have been shown to be effective in patients with PID and in patients with ITP can also be approved for use in the treatment of all types of primary immunodeficiency, as well as low antibody levels due to blood cancers and AIDS in children.
They can also be approved for the treatment of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, patients with Kawasaki disease and patients undergoing a bone marrow transplant, without the need for specific studies in these diseases.
Therefore, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Kiovig’ s benefits are greater than its risks for patients who require IgG for replacement therapy, for immunomodulation or because of bone marrow transplantation.
The Committee recommended that Kiovig be given marketing authorisation.

The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Kiovig to Baxter AG on 19 January 2006.
