Operators in $[officename] Calc
You can use the following operators in $[officename] Calc:
Arithmetical Operators
These operators return numerical results.
Operator
Name
Example
+ (Plus)
Addition
1+1
- (Minus)
Subtraction
2-1
- (Minus)
Negation
-5
* (asterisk)
Multiplication
2*2
/ (Slash)
Division
9/3
% (Percent)
Percent
15%
^ (Caret)
Exponentiation
3^2
Comparative operators
These operators return either true or false.
Operator
Name
Example
= (equal sign)
Equal
A1=B1
> (Greater than)
Greater than
A1 > B1
< (Less than)
Less than
A1 < B1
> = (Greater than or equal to)
Greater than or equal to
A1 > =B1
< = (Less than or equal to)
Less than or equal to
A1 < =B1
< > (Inequality)
Inequality
A1 < > B1
Text operators
The operator combines separate texts into one text.
Operator
Name
Example
& (And)
text concatenation AND
text concatenation AND
&quot; Sun &quot; & &quot; day &quot; is &quot; Sunday &quot;
Reference operators
These operators return a cell range of zero, ore or more cells.
Range has the highest precedence, then intersection, and then finally union.
Operator
Name
Example
:
(Colon)
Range
A1:C108
!
(Exclamation mark)
intersection operator
Intersection
SUM(A1:B6!B5:C12)
Calculates the sum of all cells in the intersection; in this example, the result yields the sum of cells B5 and B6.
~ (Tilde)
Concatenation or union
Takes two references and returns a reference list, which is a concatenation of the left reference followed by the right reference.
Double entries are referenced twice.
See note below this table.
Reference concatenation using a tilde character is a new operator, available starting with OpenOffice.org 3.0 and StarOffice 9.
When a formula with the tilde operator exists in a document that is opened in previous versions of the software, an error is returned.
A reference list is not allowed inside an array expression.
