Semi-Flatten
The Semi-flatten filter helps those in need of a solution to anti-aliasing indexed images with transparency. The GIF indexed format supports complete transparency (0 or 255 alpha value), but not semi-transparency (1 - 254): semi-transparent pixels will be transformed to no transparency or complete transparency, ruining anti-aliasing you applied to the logo you want to put onto your Web page.
Before applying the filter, it's essential that you should know the background color of your Web page. Use the color-picker to determine the exact color which pops up as the Foreground color of the Toolbox. Invert FG/BG colors so that BG color is the same as Web background color.
Semi-flatten process will combine FG color to layer (logo) color, proportionally to corresponding alpha values, and will rebuild correct anti-aliasing. Completely transparent pixels will not take the color. Very transparent pixels will take a few color and weakly transparent will take much color.
You can access this filter in the image window menu through
Example
In the example below, the Toolbox Background color is pink, and the image has feathered edges on a transparent background.

Full transparency is kept. Semi-tranparent pixels are colored with pink according to their transparency (Alpha value). This image will well merge into the pink background of the new page.

ImageMap
Clickable image
In Web sensitive images are frequently used to get some effects when defined areas are enabled by the pointer. Obviously the most used effect is a dynamic link to another web page when one of the sensitive areas is clicked on. This
This plug-in lets you design graphically and friendly all areas you want to delimit over your displayed image. You get the relevant part of html tags that must be merged into the right place in your page html code. You can define some actions linked to these areas too.
This is a complex tool which is not completely described here (it works about like Web page makers offering this function). However we want to describe here some of the most current handlings. If you want, you can find a more complete descriptions in Grokking the GIMP with the link
From an image window, you can find this filter through
The window is a small one, but you can magnify it. The main useful areas are:
completely on the left are vertically displayed icons, one for pointing, three for calling tools to generate various shape areas, one to edit zone properties, and finally one to erase a selected zone; you can call these functions with the Mapping menu,
just on the right is your working area where you can draw all the shapes areas you want with the relevant tools,
on the right is displayed an icon vertical set; its use is obvious but a help pop-up gives you some information about each function,
finally, even on the right is a display area, as a property list of the created areas. A click on one item of the list selects automatically the corresponding shape in the working area,

The Menu Bar
The menu bar is similar to the image window menu bar, only a few menus or menu entries are different:
File
Save; Save As
Contrary to other filters, this plug-in doesn't make an image but a text file. So you must save your work in a text format.

In the plug-in you can open the saved text file. The areas defined in your file will be loaded and overdisplayed; if the displayed image is not the original one or not with the same size,

Editing an imagemap area
In the settings dialog you can edit the area information of a selected area. This dialog will pop up automatically whenever you create a new area.
View
This menu offers you special functions:
Area list
Here you can hide or show the selection area.
Source
Here you see the raw data as you would save it to or read it from a file.
Color; Grayscale
You can select the image mode here and work with a Grayscale display.
Mapping
You will seldom use this menu, since you can more easily access selection tools by clicking on icons on the left of the working area.
Arrow
The arrow here represents the Move tool. When activated tool is selected, you can select and move an area on the image.
With a polygon, you can use the arrow to move one of the red points. Right-click on a segment between two red points to open a pop-up menu that offers, with several others, the possibility to add a new point. If you right-click on a red point, you can remove it.
Rectangle; Circle; Polygon
These tools let you create various shape areas: click on the image, move the pointer, and click again.

The Working Area
In the main area of the imagemap window, on the left side, you will find your working area where you can draw all the shapes areas you want with the relevant tools.
Beside the working area there are vertically displayed icons, one for pointing, three for calling tools to generate various shape areas, one to edit zone properties, and finally one to erase a selected zone; you can call these functions with the Mapping menu too.
Note that the areas should not overlap.
The selection area
On the right is a display area, as a property list of the created areas. A click on one item of the list selects automatically the corresponding shape in the working area, then you can modify it.
Beside the display is an icon vertical set; its use is obvious but a help pop-up gives you some information about each function.
Unfortunately, the arrow symbols for moving a list entry up or down do not work here. But of course you carefully avoided to create overlapping areas, so you do not use these functions at all.
