Introduction
What's & kteatime;?
& kteatime; is a handy timer for steeping tea. No longer will you have to guess at how long it takes for your tea to be ready. Simply select the type of tea you have, and it will alert you when the tea is ready to drink.
How to Use & kteatime;
When you start up & kteatime;, it will automatically dock itself in your panel. To access the menu, right click on the docked icon. This will present a list of options which are covered in more detail in the next chapter.
Timing Your Tea
Upon starting, the panel icon will be that of an empty tea mug. If you click on the mug and select your tea, the icon will change to a filled mug. After the specified time, the tea will be finished, and a suitable message box will be shown. At this point, you can close the message box by clicking on it and reset the timer by clicking on the icon. The mug will be shown as empty again.
The timer should only be reset by those who really enjoy tea.
Menu Options
The following section describes the menu options that are available in & kteatime;.
Select Your Tea
Clicking on the icon with the & RMB; will bring up a menu. At the top of the menu there are three menu items. Here, you can select what kind of tea you are preparing to drink. There are: Black Tea, Earl Grey, and Fruit Tea. These teas are preconfigured with a default time. Many people have complained that the times are not correct. Please be aware that the amount of time it takes to steep a cup of tea is based on personal preference. The times chosen are approximations. If you read on, you will learn how to change or delete these predefined times and to set your own time. A quick-and-easy way to set a custom time is to choose Anonymous... from the menu.
Start
This menu item will start the tea timer for the tea marked above. As confirmation that you have indeed selected Start, the panel icon will change into a filled mug.
Configure
This menu item opens up the configuration dialog box. A screenshot is shown below:

As shown in the picture, you may add new entries for other tea or change names, times and the order of existing entries. This is useful if you are brewing a cup of tea that is not on the list or if you do not agree with the predefined times. To edit one entry, mark it in the Tea List on the left and change the values in the Tea Properties on the right.
The box below is the Action field. Here you can define an action that will be executed when the time is up. The button Configure Events... brings up the & kde; Notification Settings for & kteatime;. The Event check box below enables the event selected in the & kde; Notification Settings. If Popup is selected, a message box will appear alerting you to the fact that your tea is ready. The third check box can hold any valid system command. Probably, you will want to leave it blank.
If you enable the check box labeled Visualize progress in icon tray, the progress will be shown as a little animated pie chart inside the icon.
