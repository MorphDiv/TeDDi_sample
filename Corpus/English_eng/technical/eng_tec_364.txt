About Import and Export Filters
XML formats
you can also open and save many foreign XML formats.
In UNIX, certain file formats cannot be recognised automatically.
$[officename] normally recognises the correct file type automatically on opening a file.
There may be cases where you have to select the file type yourself in the
Open
dialogue box.
For example, if you have a database table in text format that you want to open as a database table, you must specify the file type &quot; Text CSV &quot; after selecting the file.
Basic Macros in Microsoft Office Documents
Tools - Options - Load/Save - VBA Properties
you can specify the settings for the VBA macro codes in Microsoft Office documents.
VBA macros are unable to run in $[officename]; they must first be converted and adapted.
Often you only want to use $[officename] to change the visible content of a Word, Excel or PowerPoint file and then save the file again in Microsoft Office format without changing the macros they contain.
You can set the behaviour of $[officename] as desired:
Either the VBA macros are saved in commented form as a subroutine of $[officename] and when the document is saved in Microsoft Office format are written back correctly again, or you can select the Microsoft Office macros to be removed when loading.
The last option is an effective protection against viruses within the Microsoft Office documents.
Notes regarding external formats and file types

If you select such a filter, a message will appear saying that you can still install the filter if you require.
Modify
option.
Then you will see a dialogue box in which you can add or remove individual components of %PRODUCTNAME.
Graphic filters can be found in &quot; Optional Components &quot; .
Importing and Exporting Text Documents
$[officename] Writer can read various versions of the Microsoft Word file format.
You also can save your own documents in Microsoft Word format.
However, not everything available with $[officename] Writer can be transferred to Microsoft Word, and not everything can be imported.
Importing is normally not problematic.
Even redlining information and controls are imported (and exported) so that $[officename] recognises inserted or deleted text in Microsoft Word documents as well as font attributes that have been modified.
Different colouring for each author and the time of such changes is also included.
When graphic text boxes and labels are imported from templates, most of the attributes are also imported as direct paragraph and drawing attributes.
However, some of the attributes may be discarded during the import procedure.
It is also possible to import and export
RTF
files.
This file format can be used to exchange formatted text across various applications and platforms.
In this way, many formats read by most programs will be transferred without a problem.
The clipboard uses RTF format when you insert part of a spreadsheet from $[officename] Calc through
DDE
into $[officename] Writer.
Text Encoded
helps you open and save text documents with another encoding font.
The filter opens a dialogue box that enables you to select character set, default fonts, language and paragraph break.
Importing and Exporting in HTML Format
When borders in HTML documents are exported, lines are exported in a width of exactly 1 pixel since Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer do not recognise smaller lines.
When importing, a border of 1 pixel width will appear with 0.05 pt width.
With $[officename] Writer, you can insert footnotes and endnotes in your HTML document.
They are exported as meta tags.
The footnote and endnote characters are exported as hyperlinks.
Comments are used to include unknown characters in an HTML document.
Every note that begins with &quot; HTML:... &quot; and ends with &quot; > &quot; is treated as an HTML code, but is exported without these designations.
Several tags around text can be included after &quot; HTML:... &quot; Accented characters are converted into the ANSI character set.
Comments are created during import (for example, for meta tags that have no room in the file properties or unknown tags).
The HTML import of $[officename] Writer is able to read files that have UTF-8 or UCS2 character coding.
All characters that are contained in the ANSI character set or in the system's character set can be displayed.
Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility
is used.
Characters not present there are written in a substitute form, which is displayed correctly in modern web browsers.
When exporting such characters, you will receive an appropriate warning.
Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility
, you select Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer or $[officename] Writer as the export option, upon export all important font attributes are exported as direct attributes (for example, text colour, font size, bold, italic, and so on) in CSS1 styles.
(
CSS
stands for Cascading Style Sheets.) Importing is also carried out according to this standard.
The &quot; font &quot; property corresponds to Netscape Navigator; that is, before the font size you can specify optional values for &quot; font-style &quot; (italic, none), &quot; font-variant &quot; (normal, small-caps) and &quot; font-weight &quot; (normal, bold).
For example, &quot; Font: bold italic small-caps 12pt/200% Arial, Helvetica &quot; switches to bold, italic, small caps, double-space with the font family Arial or Helvetica, if Arial doesn't exist.
&quot; Font:
10pt &quot; switches to a 10pt font, with bold, italic, small caps off.
If Microsoft Internet Explorer or $[officename] Writer are set as the export option, the sizes of the control field and their internal margins are exported as styles (print formats).
CSS1 size properties are based on &quot; width &quot; and &quot; height &quot; values.
The &quot; Margin &quot; property is used to set equal margins on all sides of the page.
To allow different margins, the &quot; Margin-Left &quot; , &quot; Margin-Right &quot; , &quot; Margin-Top &quot; and &quot; Margin-Bottom &quot; properties are used.
The distances of graphics and Plug-Ins to the content can be set individually for export to $[officename] Writer and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
If the top/bottom or right/left margin is set differently, the distances are exported in a &quot; STYLE &quot; option for the corresponding tag as CSS1 size properties &quot; Margin-Top &quot; , &quot; Margin-Bottom &quot; , &quot; Margin-Left &quot; and &quot; Margin-Right &quot; .
Plug-Ins,
and Floating Frames, but character-linked frames are not possible.
Text frames are exported as &quot; < SPAN > &quot; or &quot; < DIV > &quot; tags if they do not contain columns.
If they do contain columns then they are exported as &quot; < MULTICOL > &quot; .

Then, in HTML documents, besides the HTML Page Style, you can also use the styles &quot; First page &quot; , &quot; Left page &quot; and &quot; Right page &quot; .
These styles should enable you to set different page sizes and margins for the first page and for right and left pages when printing.
Importing and Exporting Numbering
Tools - Options - Load/Save - HTML Compatibility
, the export option &quot; $[officename] Writer &quot; or &quot; Internet Explorer &quot; is selected, the indents of numberings are exported as &quot; margin-left &quot; CSS1 property in the STYLE attribute of the < OL > and < UL > tags.
The property indicates the difference relative to the indent of the next higher level.
A left paragraph indent in numbering is indicated as &quot; margin-left &quot; CSS1 property.
First-line indents are ignored in numbering and not exported.
Importing and Exporting Spreadsheet Files
$[officename] imports and exports references to deleted sections such as, for example, a referenced column.
The whole formula can be viewed during the export process and the deleted reference contains an indication (#REF!) to the reference.
A #REF! will be correspondingly created for the reference during the import.
Importing and Exporting Graphics Files
As with HTML documents, you can choose to use a filter with or without the element ($[officename] Impress) in the name to open a $[officename] graphics file.
If without, the file will be opened as a $[officename] Draw document.
Otherwise, the file saved by an old program version is now opened in $[officename] Impress.
If a different printer is used the preview will be printed.
When exporting EPS graphics, a preview is created and has the TIFF or EPSI format.
If an EPS graphic together with other graphics is exported in the EPS format then this file will be embedded unchanged in the new file.
Multi-page TIFFs are allowed when graphics are imported or exported in TIFF format.
The graphics are retrieved as a set of individual pictures in a single file, for example, the individual pages of a fax.
