Shear
Tools
The Shear tool in Toolbox
Shear tool is used to shift one part of an image, a layer, a selection or a path to a direction and the other part to the opposite direction. For instance, a horizontal shearing will shift the upper part to the right and the lower part to the left. A rectangle becomes a diamond. This is not a rotation: the image is distorted. To use this tool after selecting, click on the image or the selection: a grid is possibly surperimposed and the Shearing Information dialog is opened. By dragging the mouse pointer on the image you distort the image, horizontally or vertically according to the direction given to the pointer. When you are satisfied, click on the

Transform Direction
The Transform Direction sets which way or direction a layer is rotated. The Normal mode will rotate the layer as one might expect. If a layer is rotated 10 degrees to the right, then the layer will be rendered as such. This behaviour is contrary to Corrective rotation.
Corrective Rotation is primarily used to repair digital images that are not straight. If the image is 13 degrees askew then you need not try to rotate by that angle. By using Corrective Rotation you can rotate visually and line up the layer with the image. Because the transformation is reversed, or performed backwards, the image will be rotated with sufficient angle to correct the error.

Tool
Crop tool
The Crop Tool is used to crop or clip an image. It works on all the layers of the image, visible and invisible. This tool is often used to remove borders, or to eliminate unwanted areas to provide you with a more focused working area. It is also useful if you need a specific image size that does not match the original dimensions of your image.
Just like the selection tools, the new crop tool has been enhanced with the v2.4 release. The resize handles actually resize the crop rectangle instead of providing both resize and move functionality. The tool behaves more naturally and consistently with other GIMP tools. To move, simply drag the rectangle clicking within the area. Resizing is possible in one or two axes at the same time dragging the handle-bars on the sides and corners. The outside area can be darkened with a nice passepartout effect to better get the idea of how the final crop will look like. To validate cropping, click inside the crop rectangle or press the

No guides
