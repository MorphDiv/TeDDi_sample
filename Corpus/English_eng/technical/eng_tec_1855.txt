$[officename] Draw Features
$[officename] Draw lets you create simple and complex drawings and export them in a number of common image formats.
You can also insert tables, charts, formulae and other items created in $[officename] programs into your drawings.
Vector Graphics
$[officename] Draw creates vector graphics using lines and curves defined by mathematical vectors.
Vectors describe lines, ellipses, and polygons according to their geometry.
Creating 3-D Objects
You can create simple 3-D objects such as cubes, spheres, and cylinders in $[officename] Draw and even modify the light source of the objects.
Grids and Guides
Grids and guides provide a visual cue to help you align objects in your drawing.
You can also choose to snap an object to a grid line, guide or to the edge of another object.
Connecting Objects to Show Relationships
You can connect objects in $[officename] Draw with special lines called &quot; connectors &quot; to show the relationship between objects.
Connectors attach to glue points on drawing objects and remain attached when the connected objects are moved.
Connectors are useful for creating organisation charts and technical diagrams.
Displaying Dimensions
Technical diagrams often show the dimensions of objects in the drawing.
In $[officename] Draw, you can use dimension lines to calculate and display linear dimensions.
Gallery
The Gallery contains images, animations, sounds and other items that you can insert and use in your drawings as well as other $[officename] programs.
Graphic File Formats
$[officename] Draw can export to many common graphic file formats, such as BMP, GIF, JPG, and PNG.
