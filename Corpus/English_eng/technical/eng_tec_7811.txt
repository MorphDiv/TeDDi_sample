3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Dispersion for injection.
Clear solution with white microsphere layer on top.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only.
OPTISON is a transpulmonary echocardiographic contrast agent for use in patients with suspected or established cardiovascular disease to provide opacification of cardiac chambers, enhance left ventricular endocardial border delineation with resulting improvement in wall motion visualisation.
OPTISON should only be used in patients where the study without contrast enhancement is inconclusive.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
OPTISON should only be administered by physicians experienced in the field of diagnostic ultrasound imaging.
Before administering OPTISON, please see section 6.6 for instructions for use/ handling.
This medicinal product is intended for left ventricular opacification after intravenous administration.
Ultrasound imaging must be performed during injection of OPTISON as optimal contrast effect is obtained immediately after administration.
Dosage The recommended dose is 0.5 ml - 3.0 ml per patient.
A dose of 3.0 ml is usually sufficient, but some patients may need higher doses.
The total dose should not exceed 8.7 ml per patient.
The duration of
2 the useful imaging time is 2.5 - 4.5 minutes for a dose of 0.5 - 3.0 ml.
OPTISON could be repeatedly administered, however, the clinical experience is limited.
Paediatric patients OPTISON is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Pulmonary hypertension with a systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 90 mm Hg.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Hypersensitivity has been reported.
Care should therefore be exercised.
A course of action should be planned in advance with necessary drugs and equipment available for immediate treatment, in case a serious reaction should occur.
The experience of OPTISON in severely ill patients is limited.
There is limited clinical experience with OPTISON in patients with certain severe states of cardiac, pulmonary, renal and hepatic disease.
Such clinical states include adult respiratory distress syndrome, the use of artificial respiration with positive end-expiratory pressure, severe heart failure (NYHA IV), endocarditis, acute myocardial infarction with on-going angina or unstable angina, hearts with prosthetic valves, acute states of systemic inflammation or sepsis, known states of hyperactive coagulation system and/ or recurrent thromboembolism, renal or hepatic end-stage disease.
OPTISON should be used in these categories of patients only after careful consideration, and monitored closely during and after administration.
Other routes of administration not specified in section 4.2 above (e. g. intracoronary injection) are not recommended.
When medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, infectious diseases due to the transmission of infective agents cannot be totally excluded.
This applies also to pathogens of hitherto unknown origin.
To reduce the risk of transmission of infective agents, stringent controls are applied to the selection of blood donors and donations.
In addition, virus removal and/ or inactivation procedures are included in the production process.
The current procedures applied in the manufacture of medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma are effective against enveloped viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses.
These procedures are of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as hepatitis A virus.
OPTISON contrast echocardiography should be accompanied by ECG monitoring.
In animal studies, the application of echo-contrast agents revealed biological side effects (e. g. endothelial cell injury, capillary rupture) by interaction with the ultrasound beam.
Although these biological side effects have not been reported in humans, the use of a low mechanical index and end- diastolic triggering is recommended.
Efficacy and safety in patients below 18 years has not been studied.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
Use during anaesthesia with halothane and oxygen has not been studied.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
3 The safety of OPTISON for use during human pregnancy has not been established.
In pregnant rabbits exposed to daily doses of 2.5 ml/ kg (approximately 15 x the maximum recommended clinical dose) during organogenesis, maternal toxicity and embryo-foetal toxicity including a slight to extreme dilation of ventricles in the brain of developing rabbit embryos was observed.
The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.
Therefore OPTISON should not be used in pregnancy unless benefit outweighs risk and it is considered necessary by the physician.
It is not known whether OPTISON is excreted in human milk.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when OPTISON is administered to breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on the ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adverse reactions to OPTISON are rare and usually of a non-serious nature.
In general, the administration of human albumin has been associated with transient altered taste, nausea, flushing, rash, headache, vomiting, chills and fever.
Anaphylactic reactions have been associated with the administration of human albumin products.
The reported adverse events following the use of OPTISON in Phase III human clinical studies have been mild to moderate with subsequent full recovery.
In clinical trials with OPTISON, undesirable effects were reported as adverse events with the following frequencies given in the table below (Very common ≥ 1/ 10; Common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); Very rare < 1/ 10,000, not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Ultrasound contrast medium, ATC Code:
V08D A01
When used in conjunction with diagnostic ultrasound, OPTISON provides opacification of cardiac chambers, improvement in delineation of endocardial borders, enhancement of the Doppler signal, and visualisation of wall motion and blood flow within the heart.
The ultrasound echoes from blood and biological soft tissues such as fat and muscles are generated at interfaces due to small differences in the ultrasonic properties of the tissues.
The ultrasonic properties of microspheres containing perflutren are very different from that of soft tissue and will generate strong echoes.
OPTISON consists of perflutren -containing microspheres.
The microspheres have a mean diameter of 2.5 - 4.5 microns and concentrations of 5-8 x 108 microspheres/ ml.
Microspheres in this size range contribute to the contrast effect by generating strongly enhanced echoes.
As OPTISON consists of microspheres that are stable and small enough for transpulmonary passage, it will also give enhanced echo signals in the left heart cavities.
As a consequence of the complex relationship between the concentration of the microspheres and the ultrasound signal, data processing within the ultrasound equipment and the fact that each individual responds differently due to variability in cardiac and pulmonary function, a strict dose/ response relationship cannot be defined.
The dose of OPTISON will therefore have to be adjusted individually, although clinical studies have shown that an initial dose of 0.5 - 3.0 ml per patient can be recommended for left heart opacification.
Higher doses produce greater contrast effect of longer duration.
Duration of useful contrast effect at the recommended dose is adequate to perform a complete echocardiographic examination including Doppler assessment.
Use the smallest dose for adequate opacification of cavities since larger doses produce image blocking effects with the possibility of obscuring important information.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following intravenous injection of 0.21 to 0.33 ml/ kg of OPTISON to healthy volunteers, the perflutren component of OPTISON was rapidly and nearly completely eliminated in less than 10 minutes with a dominating pulmonary elimination half life of 1.3±0.7 minutes.
The perflutren levels detected in blood following this dosage were too low and transient to accurately determine pharmacokinetic parameters.
The disposition and elimination of the albumin microspheres have not been studied in humans.
Information obtained from a preclinical study in rats with 125I-labelled albumin microspheres indicated that microspheres were rapidly cleared from the circulation, and radio-labelled microspheres, albumin
5 shells and 125I were taken up primarily in the liver.
The primary route of elimination of radioactivity was the urine.
High levels of radioactivity were also retained in lungs for a considerable time, approx.
10% of the total dose 40 minutes after dose administration (cf.
35% in liver).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.
In the rabbit embryotoxicity study, a significant increase in the number of fetuses with dilated ventricles in the brain was observed (see section 4.6).
No such finding was observed in the rat embryotoxicity study.

PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS
6.1 List of excipients
Human albumin Sodium chloride N-acetyltryptophan Caprylic acid Sodium hydroxide (pH adjustment) Water for injections
6.2 Incompatibilities
OPTISON must not be mixed with other medicinal products.
A separate syringe should be used.
6.3 Shelf life
Unopened vial in the outer packaging:
2 years.
Finished product after rubber stopper perforation:
30 minutes.
6.4 Special precautions for storage
Store upright in a refrigerator (2oC - 8ºC).
Storage at room temperature (up to 25ºC) for 1 day is acceptable.
Do not freeze.
6.5 Nature and contents of container
3 ml type I glass vial, closed with bromobutyl rubber stopper, and sealed with aluminium cap with coloured plastic flip-off top.
OPTISON is supplied as:
1 vial of 3 ml or 5 vials of 3 ml.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
Like all parenteral products, the vials of OPTISON should be inspected visually for integrity of the container.
6 Vials are intended for single use only.
Once the rubber stopper has been penetrated, the contents should be used within 30 minutes and any unused product discarded.
OPTISON in the non-resuspended form has a white layer of microspheres on top of the liquid phase that requires resuspension before use.
Homogenous white suspension after resuspension.
The following instructions should be followed:
- Cold solutions taken directly from the refrigerator should not be injected.
- Allow the vial to reach room temperature and inspect the liquid phase for particulate matter or
precipitates before resuspension.
- Insert a 20 G plastic cannula in a large antecubital vein, preferably of the right arm.
Attach a
three-way stopcock to the cannula.
- The OPTISON vial must be inverted and gently rotated for approximately three minutes to
completely resuspend the microspheres.
- Complete resuspension is indicated by a uniformly opaque white suspension and absence of any
material on stopper and vial surfaces.
- OPTISON should be withdrawn with care into a syringe within 1 minute after resuspension.
- Any pressure instability within the vial should be avoided since it may cause disruption of
microspheres and loss of contrast effect.
Thus, vent the vial with a sterile spike or with a sterile 18 G needle before withdrawing the suspension into the injection syringe.
Do not inject air into the vial as this will damage the product.
- Use the suspension within 30 minutes after withdrawal.
- OPTISON will segregate in an undisturbed syringe and must be resuspended before use.
- Resuspend the microspheres in the syringe immediately before injection by holding the syringe
horizontally between the palms of the hands and rolling it quickly back and forth for no less than 10 seconds.
- Inject the suspension through the plastic cannula, no smaller than 20 G at a maximum injection
rate of 1.0 ml/ s.
Warning:
Never use any other type of route but the open flow connection.
If injected otherwise OPTISON bubbles will be destroyed.
- Immediately before injection a careful visual inspection of the syringe is mandatory in order to
ensure complete suspension of the microspheres.
Immediately after injection of OPTISON, 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution for injection should be injected at a rate of 1 ml/ s.
Alternately, the flushing may be performed by infusion.
The infusion set should then be attached to the three-way stopcock and intravenous infusion started at a “ to keep open” (TKO) rate.
Immediately after OPTISON injection, the intravenous infusion should be wide open until contrast begins to fade from the left ventricle.
The infusion should then be returned to a TKO rate.

1.
WHAT OPTISON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
OPTISON is an ultrasound contrast agent that helps to obtain clearer pictures (scan) of the heart during an echocardiography (a procedure where an image of the heart is obtained by using ultrasound).
OPTISON improves the visualization of the inner cardiac walls in patients where the walls are difficult to see.
OPTISON contains microspheres (tiny gas bubbles) that after injection travel through the veins to the heart and fill the left heart chambers, allowing the doctor to visualise and asses the function of the heart.
This medicine is for diagnostic use only.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE OPTISON
Do not use OPTISON
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to perflutren or to any of the ingredients of OPTISON.
- if you have severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 90 mm Hg).
Take special care with OPTISON
- if you have any known allergies.
- if you have a severe heart, lung, kidney or liver disease.
The experience of OPTISON in severely ill
patients is limited.
- if you have an artificial valve in your heart.
- if you have acute severe inflammation or sepsis.
- if you have a known blood clotting problem
Your heart activity and rhythm will be monitored when you get OPTISON.
Efficacy and safety in patients below 18 years has not been studied.
Using other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without prescription.
17 Pregnancy and breast-feeding The safety of OPTISON for use during human pregnancy has not been fully established.
Therefore, the medicine should not be used in pregnancy unless benefit outweighs risk and it is considered necessary by the doctor.
However, because OPTISON is based on human albumin (the main protein in our blood), it is highly unlikely that it will have any harmful effects in pregnancy.
It is not known whether OPTISON passes into human milk.
Therefore, caution should be exercised when OPTISON is administered to nursing women.
Driving and using machines No effects are known.
Important information about some of the ingredients of OPTISON This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE OPTISON
OPTISON should only be administered by doctors experienced in the field of diagnostic ultrasound imaging.
OPTISON is administered via an intravenous injection to allow the microspheres to enter the heart chamber and fill the left heart chamber.
OPTISON is injected during the ultrasound examination in order to allow the doctor to assess the function of your heart.
The recommended dose is 0.5 ml - 3.0 ml per patient.
A dose of 3.0 ml is usually sufficient, but some patients may need higher doses.
This dose might be repeated if needed.
The duration of the useful imaging time is 2.5 - 4.5 minutes for a dose of 0.5 - 3.0 ml.
Immediately after injection of OPTISON, 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ ml solution for injection should be injected at a rate of 1 ml/ s to optimise the effect of the contrast agent.
If you are given more OPTISON than you should Effects suspected to be due to overdose have not been reported.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, OPTISON can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Side effects to OPTISON are rare and usually not serious.
In general the administration of human albumin has been associated with transient (non lasting)altered taste, nausea, flushing, rash, headache, vomiting, chills and fever.
Rare severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) have been associated with the administration of human albumin products.
Reported side effects following the use of OPTISON:
Common side effects (affects 1 to 10 users in 100): • Dysgeusia (altered taste) • Headache • Flushing (redness) • Warm sensation
18 Uncommon side effects (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000): • Eosinophilia (increased number of a type of white blood cells in the blood) • Dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing) • Chest pain
Rare side effects (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000): • Tinnitus (noises in the ear) • Dizziness • Paraesthesia (tingling sensations)
Unknown frequency (side effects where frequency cannot be estimated from the available data): • Allergic type symptoms, for example, a severe allergic reaction or – shock (anaphylaxis), swelling of the face (face oedema), an itchy skin eruption (urticaria). • Visual disturbances
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor.
5.

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
The recommended dose is 0.5 ml - 3.0 ml per patient.
A dose of 3.0 ml is usually sufficient, but some patients may need higher doses.
The total dose should not exceed 8.7 ml per patient.
The duration of the useful imaging time is 2.5 - 4.5 minutes for a dose of 0.5 - 3.0 ml.
OPTISON could be repeatedly administered, however, the clinical experience is limited.
Use the smallest dose for adequate opacification of cavities since larger doses produce image blocking effects with the possibility of obscuring important information.
Like all parenteral products, the vials of OPTISON should be inspected visually for integrity of the container.
Vials are intended for single use only.
Once the rubber stopper has been penetrated, the contents should be used within 30 minutes and any unused product discarded.
OPTISON in the non-resuspended form has a white layer of microspheres on top of the liquid phase that requires resuspension before use.
Homogenous white suspension after resuspension.
The following instructions should be followed:
- Cold solutions taken directly from the refrigerator should not be injected.
- Allow the vial to reach room temperature and inspect the liquid phase for particulate matter or
precipitates before resuspension.
- Insert a 20 G plastic cannula in a large antecubital vein, preferably of the right arm.
Attach a three-
way stopcock to the cannula.
- The OPTISON vial must be inverted and gently rotated for approximately three minutes to
completely resuspend the microspheres.
- Complete resuspension is indicated by a uniformly opaque white suspension and absence of any
material on stopper and vial surfaces.
- OPTISON should be withdrawn with care into the syringe within 1 minute after resuspension.
- Any pressure instability within the vial should be avoided since it may cause disruption of
microspheres and loss of contrast effect.
Thus, vent the vial with a sterile spike or with a sterile 18 G needle before withdrawing the suspension into the injection syringe.
Do not inject air into the vial as this will damage the product.
- Use the suspension within 30 minutes after withdrawal.

- OPTISON will segregate in an undisturbed syringe and must be resuspended before use.
- Resuspend the microspheres in the syringe immediately before injection by holding the syringe
horizontally between the palms of the hands and rolling it quickly back and forth for no less than 10 seconds.
- Inject the suspension through the plastic cannula, no smaller than 20 G at a maximum injection rate
of 1.0 ml/ s.
Warning:
Never use any other type of route but the open flow connection.
If injected otherwise OPTISON bubbles will be destroyed.
- Immediately before injection a careful visual inspection of the syringe is mandatory in order to
ensure complete resuspension of the microspheres.
Immediately after injection of OPTISON, 10 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution for injection should be injected at a rate of 1 ml/ s.
Alternatively the flushing may be performed by infusion.
The infusion set should then be attached to the three-way stopcock and intravenous infusion started at a ” to keep open” (TKO) rate.
Immediately after OPTISON injection the intravenous infusion should be wide open until contrast begins to fade from the left ventricle.
The infusion should then be returned to a TKO rate.
