Introduction
The & kmail; Team welcomes you to & kmail;, a user-friendly email client for the K Desktop Environment. Our goal is to make & kmail; a program that is beautiful and intuitive without sacrificing power.
If you have never set up an email client on a & UNIX; system before, we suggest that you read through the Getting Started section first so that your setup goes smoothly.
Since most people do not read documentation anyway, here is a collection of the most helpful tips:
You do not have to use your mouse to use & kmail;. Everything can be done by using Keyboard Shortcuts.
Although & kmail; can be considered reliable you should keep backups of your messages, & ie; just copy the files and folders in ~/ Mail (including the hidden ones that start with a dot) to a safe place.
& kmail; 's homepage can be found at http: / /kontact. kde. org/ kmail/. There you will find useful links, & eg; to the user and developer mailing lists. Please report bugs in & kmail; using Help Report Bug....
We hope you will enjoy & kmail;!
