Protecting Cells from Changes
%PRODUCTNAME
Calc you can protect sheets and the document as a whole.
You can choose whether the cells are protected against accidental changes, whether the formulae can be viewed from within Calc, whether the cells are visible or whether the cells can be printed.
Protection can be provided by means of a password, but it does not have to be.
If you have assigned a password, protection can only be removed once the correct password has been entered.
Protected
attribute is only effective when you protect the whole table.
In the default condition, every cell has the
Protected
attribute.
Therefore you must remove the attribute selectively for those cells where the user may make changes.
You then protect the whole table and save the document.
These protection features are just switches to prevent accidential action.
The features are not intended to provide any secure protection.
For example, by exporting a sheet to another file format, a user may be able to bypass the protection features.
There is only one secure protection: the password that you can apply when saving an OpenDocument file.
A file that has been saved with a password can be opened only with the same password.
Select the cells that you want to specify the cell protection options for.
