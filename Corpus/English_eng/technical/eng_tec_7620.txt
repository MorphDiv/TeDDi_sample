S
4.3 Contraindications
None
4.4 Special warnings
Vaccination does not affect the course of FeLV infection in cats already infected with FeLV at the time of vaccination, implying that such cats will excrete FeLV irrespective of vaccination; consequently, these animals will constitute a hazard to susceptible cats in their environment.
It is therefore recommended that cats with a significant risk of having been exposed to FeLV be tested for FeLV antigen prior to vaccination.
Test negative animals can be vaccinated, while test-positive cats should be isolated from other cats and retested within 1-2 months.
2/ 19 Cats positive at the second testing should be considered as being permanently infected with FeLV and should be handled accordingly.
Cats negative at second testing can be vaccinated since, in all likelihood, they have overcome the FeLV infection.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
In case of anaphylactoid reaction, adrenaline should be administered intramuscularly.
Vaccination of FeLV positive cats is of no benefit.
See Section 4.4 for further details.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
To the user:
This product contains mineral oil.
Accidental injection/ self injection may result in severe pain and swelling, particularly if injected into a joint or finger, and in rare cases could result in the loss of the affected finger if prompt medical attention is not given.
If you are accidentally injected with this product, seek prompt medical advice even if only a very small amount is injected and take the package insert with you.
If pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination, seek medical advice again.
To the physician:
This product contains mineral oil.
Even if small amounts have been injected, accidental injection with this product can cause intense swelling, which may, for example, result in ischaemic necrosis and even the loss of a digit.
Expert, PROMPT, surgical attention is required and may necessitate early incision and irrigation of the injected area, especially where there is involvement of finger pulp or tendon.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Vaccinated cats may develop post-vaccinal reactions including transient fever, vomiting, anorexia and/ or depression which usually disappear within 24 hours.
A local reaction with swelling, pain, pruritis or hair loss at the injections site may be observed.
In very rare cases an anaphylactoid reaction with oedema, pruritis, respiratory and cardiac distress, severe gastrointestinal signs or shock has been seen during the first hours after vaccination.
See Section 4.5 for guidance about treatment.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the vaccine in pregnant queens has not been investigated.
Vaccination of pregnant queens is not recommended.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine when used with any other veterinary medicinal product.
A decision to use this vaccine before or after any other veterinary medicinal product therefore needs to be decided on a case by case basis.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
The contents of the single dose syringe should be shaken well and administered aseptically by subcutaneous injection.
When administering the product, care must be taken to attach the enclosed sterile needle aseptically to the syringe before use.
3/ 19 Basic vaccination of cats 9 weeks and older: two doses at an interval of 3 to 4 weeks.
An additional dose is recommended for kittens living in high-risk FeLV environments whose first dose was administered before 12 weeks of age.
Revaccination: one vaccination annually.
