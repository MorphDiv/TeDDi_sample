Web Behavior
The & konqueror; Browser module of & systemsettings; allows you to select various options for the behavior of & konqueror;, the integrated web browser of & kde;.
If Ask for name and folder when adding bookmarks is checked, & konqueror; will allow you to change the title of the bookmark and choose a folder in which to store it when you add a new bookmark.
Enable Show only marked bookmarks in bookmark toolbar and & konqueror; will show only those bookmarks in the bookmark toolbar which you have marked to do so in the bookmark editor.
The next option you can enable on this page is Form Completion. If you check this box, & konqueror; will try to remember what you answer to form questions, and will try to fill in forms for you with the answers you previously used.
You can configure the number of form items & konqueror; remembers with the slider below labelled Maximum completions
Of course, anything & konqueror; fills in a form with, you can still edit before submitting the form!
The next option is Change cursor over links. If this option is selected, the shape of the cursor will change (usually to a hand) whenever it moves over a hyperlink. This makes it easy to identify links, especially when they are in the form of images.
If Middle click opens URL in selection is checked, you can open the & URL; in the selection by middle clicking on a & konqueror; view.
As a convenience feature, if you enable Right click goes back in history, then clicking an empty area (ie; not a link) in the & konqueror; window will act as if you pressed the Back button on the toolbar.
Enabling Allow automatic delayed reloading/ redirecting allows websites to send you to another page without your interaction. In many cases, this is a convenience. For example, the website has moved to a new & URL;. Many webmasters in this situation will put up a page on the old site, telling you that it has moved and you may like to change your bookmark, and then automatically move you along to the new website. However, such features can be confusing, or annoying, when misused, and so you may wish to disable it.
Enable Access Key activation with Ctrl key: Pressing the & Ctrl; key when viewing web pages activates Access Keys. Unchecking this box will disable this accessibility feature. & konqueror; needs to be restarted for this change to take effect.
KControl
Browsing With & konqueror;
& konqueror; defaults to a single window per page, but has the capability to open multiple tabs inside a single window. & konqueror; also, by default, has a & MMB; shortcut to open any link in a new window. If you enable Open links in new tab instead of in new window you can & MMB; click on a link to have it open in a new tab.
If you are using tabbed browsing, you can choose if a newly opened tab becomes the active (front) tab, or goes to the back. On a slow internet connection, or while browsing a page that has a list of headlines or other links in a list, you may like to have the new tabs load in the background while you continue reading. In this case, leave this setting disabled. If you prefer to go straight to the new page, leaving the old one in the background to return to later, enable it.
If you close a window in & konqueror; that has multiple tabs open, & konqueror; will ask you if you're sure that you meant to close it. You can toggle on and off this behavior with the Confirm when closing windows with multiple tabs checkbox.
The checkbox labeled Automatically load images, allows you to control whether images on web pages are loaded by default. Unless you have a very slow connection, you will probably want to leave this option selected, as there are many web pages that are difficult to use without images. If you do n't select the option to automatically load images, you can still view the text on the page, and then load the images if you need them.
The next setting is Underline links:. You can choose to underline links Always. If this option is selected, any text on web pages that acts as a link will be shown in an underlined font. While many web pages do use color to distinguish text that acts as a link, underlining makes it very easy to spot links.
If you do n't like underlined links, you can choose Never, so that no links are underlined. Or you can choose a middle ground, Hover, so that links are underlined when the mouse cursor is resting over them, and not underlined the rest of the time.
Many web pages use animated gif images, and these can be very annoying, and in some cases, quite a drain on your system resources. The Animations option lets you choose when animations are enabled. The default is enabled, but you can set this to disabled, or to run the animation only once, even if the file itself contains instructions that the animation should run more times, or continuously.
Fonts
Under this tab, you can select various options related to the use of fonts. Although the shapes and sizes of fonts are often part of the design of a web page, you can select some default settings for & konqueror; to use.
The first thing you can set here is the font size. There are two settings which work together to allow you a comfortable browsing experience.
Firstly, you can set a Minimum Font Size. This means, even if the font size is set specifically in the page you are viewing, & konqueror; will ignore that instruction and never show smaller fonts than you set here.
Next you can set a Medium Font Size. This is not only the default size of text, used when the page does n't specify sizes, but it is also used as the base size that relative font sizes are calculated against. That is, the HTML instruction smaller, it means smaller than the size you set for this option.
For either option, you can select the exact font size in points by using the up/ down spin control (or just typing) next to the option label.
These options are independent of each other. Pages that do not set a font size, or ask for the default, will display with the size you set from Medium Font Size, while any pages that ask for a size smaller than your Minimum Font Size setting will instead show that size. The one does not affect the other.
The remaining options are for the fonts to be associated with different types of markup used in HTML pages. Note that many web pages may override these settings. If you click anywhere on a control which shows a font name, a list of font names appears, and you can select a different font if you like. (If there are a lot of fonts, a vertical scrollbar appears in the list to allow you to scroll through all of the fonts.)
Below this, you can set a Font size adjustment for this encoding. Sometimes the fonts you want to use for a particular encoding or language are much larger or smaller than average, so you can use this setting to bring them into line.
You can set a default encoding that & konqueror; should assume pages are when rendering them. The default setting is Use language encoding, but you can change it to any encoding available in the list.
& Java; and JavaScript
& Java; allows applications to be downloaded and run by a web browser, provided you have the necessary software installed on your machine. Many web sites make use of & Java; (for example, online banking services or interactive gaming sites). You should be aware that running programs from unknown sources could pose a threat to the security of your computer, even if the potential extent of the damage is not great.
The checkboxes under Global Settings allows you to turn & Java; support on for all web sites by default. You can also select to turn & Java; on or off for specific hosts. To add a policy for a specific host, click the Add... button to bring up a dialog in which you can type the host name and then choose to accept or reject & Java; code from that particular host, which will add the domain to the list on the left of the page.
You can select a host in the list, and click the Change... button to choose a different policy for that host. Clicking the Delete button removes the policy for the selected host; after deletion, the global settings will then apply to that host. You can import policies from a file by clicking the Import... button. To save the current list to a compressed archive file, click the Export... button.
Finally, the group of controls labeled Java Runtime Settings allows you to set some options for the way in which & Java; should run. These options are useful for diagnosing problems, or if you are a & Java; developer, and should not normally need adjusting.
If you select the Show Java Console option, & konqueror; will open a console window from which & Java; applications can read and write text. While most & Java; applications will not require such a console, it could be helpful in diagnosing problems with & Java; applications.
Use KIO will cause the JVM to use & kde; 's own KIO transports for network connections.
Use security manager is normally enabled by default. This setting will cause the JVM to run with a Security Manager in place. This will keep applets from being able to read and write to your file system, creating arbitrary sockets, and other actions which could be used to compromise your system. Disable this option at your own risk. You can modify your $HOME /. java. policy file with the & Java; policytool utility to give code downloaded from certain sites more permissions.
The Shutdown Applet Server when inactive checkbox allows you to save resources by closing the & Java; Applet Server when it is not in use, rather than leaving it running in the background. Leaving this disabled may make & Java; applets start up faster, but it will use system resources when you are not using a & Java; applet. If you enable this, you can set a timeout.
You can either opt to have & konqueror; automatically detect the & Java; installation on your system, or specify the path to the installation yourself by selecting Use user-specified Java. You may want to choose the latter method, for instance, if you have multiple & Java; installations on your system, and want to specify which one to use. If the & Java; Virtual Machine you are using requires any special startup options, you can type them in the text box labeled Additional Java Arguments.
JavaScript
Despite the name, JavaScript is not related at all to & Java;.
The first part of this page works the same as the & Java; page settings.
The checkboxes under Global Settings allow you to turn JavaScript support on for all web sites by default. You can also select to turn JavaScript on or off for specific hosts. To add a policy for a specific host, click the Add... button to bring up a dialog in which you can type the host name and then choose to accept or reject JavaScript code from that particular host, which will add the domain to the list on the left of the page.
The final set of options on this page determine what happens when a page uses JavaScript for specific actions.
You can individually enable or disable the ability of JavaScript to manipulate your windows by moving, resizing or changing focus. You can also disable JavaScript from changing the status bar text, so that for instance, you can always see where links will take you when clicked. The choices for these options are Allow and Ignore.
For opening a new window, there is even more control. You can set & konqueror; to Allow all such requests, Ask each time a request is made, or Deny all popup requests.
The Smart setting will only allow JavaScript popup windows when you have explicitly chosen a link that creates one.
Plugins
The first setting here is Enable Plugins globally. If you disable this checkbox, then & konqueror; will not use any plugins. If you enable it, then any installed and configured plugins that it can find will be used by & konqueror;
You can also restrict & konqueror; to Only allow HTTP and HTTPS URLs for plugins by checking the box.
