(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
Sets the character data handler function for the XML parser parser. handler is a string containing the name of a function that must exist when xml_parse() is called for parser.
The function named by handler must accept two parameters: handler (resource parser, string data)
The first parameter, parser, is a reference to the XML parser calling the handler.
The second parameter, data, contains the character data as a string.
If a handler function is set to an empty string, or FALSE, the handler in question is disabled.
TRUE is returned if the handler is set up, FALSE if parser is not a parser.
Note:
Instead of a function name, an array containing an object reference and a method name can also be supplied.
