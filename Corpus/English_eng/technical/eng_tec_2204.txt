Optimal Width
Automatically adjusts column widths to match the contents of the cells.
Changing the width of a column does not affect the width of the other columns in the table.
The width of the table cannot exceed the page width.
The change affects only selected cells.
You can adjust multiple cells next to each other if you select the cells together.
