System Settings
keyboard
This module allows you to choose how your keyboard works.
The actual effect of setting these options depends upon the features provided by your keyboard hardware and the X server on which & kde; is running. As an example, you may find that changing the key click volume has no effect because that feature is not available on your system.
NumLock on KDE Startup
You can choose to either always Turn on or Turn off the NumLock when & kde; starts, or you can choose to have & kde; leave NumLock at whatever it was set to before & kde; started up.
Enable keyboard repeat
When this option is selected, pressing and holding down a key emits the same character repeatedly until the key is released. Pressing and holding the key will have the same effect as pressing it multiple times in succession.
Almost all users will want to have this option enabled, because it makes navigating through documents with the arrow keys significantly easier.
Delay
This option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes.
Rate
This option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed.
Key click volume
If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. In essence, this simulates the click of a mechanical type-writer. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin-button. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.
Many computers wo n't support this function.
Very few people would choose to enable this option, since it generally annoys everyone else in the room. However, if your heart yearns for the pre-soft-key era, this may help you to re-experience the warm sentimentality of days-gone-by.
