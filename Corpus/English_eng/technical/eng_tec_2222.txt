Show Details (DataPilot)
Inserts a new &quot; drill-down &quot; sheet with more information about the current DataPilot cell.
You can also double-click a DataPilot cell to insert the &quot; drill-down &quot; sheet.
The new sheet shows a subset of rows from the original data source that constitutes the result data displayed in the current cell.
see http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Calc/Features/DataPilot_drill-down_on_data_field
For instance, when the data field function is selected to be SUM, then the number that is shown in the data field cell must be identical to the sum of all the data field values in the constituent rows displayed in the inserted sheet.
UFI: this text from spec doc looks like a remark to the developer who implements this feature rather than something for the user
Hidden items are not evaluated, the rows for the hidden items are included.
Show Details is available only for DataPilot tables that are based on cell ranges or database data.
