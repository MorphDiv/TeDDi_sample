(PHP 4)
Returns an array of the names of all files that have been included using include(), include_once(), require() or require_once().
Files that are included or required multiple times only show up once in the returned array.
Note:
Files included using the auto_prepend_file configuration directive are not included in the returned array.
Example 1. get_included_files() Example
?php include( "test1.php"); include_once("test2.php"); require("test3.php"); require_once("test4.php"); $included_files = get_included_files(); foreach($included_files as $filename) {echo "$filename\n";}?
test1.php test2.php test3.php test4.php
Note:
In PHP 4.0.1pl2 and previous versions get_included_files() assumed that the required files ended in the extension .php; other extensions would not be returned.
The array returned by get_included_files() was an associative array and only listed files included by include() and include_once().
See also: include(), include_once(), require(), require_once(), and get_required_files().
