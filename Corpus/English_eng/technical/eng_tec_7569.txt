CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs
4.2 Indications for use
Reduction of inflammation and relief of pain caused by acute and chronic musculoskeletal disorders.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in pregnant or lactating dogs or in bitches intended for breeding.
Use is contraindicated in animals suffering from cardiac or hepatic disease, or where there is a history of gastrointestinal ulceration, or bleeding, or where there is hypersensitivity to the product.
Do not use in dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive dogs, as there is an increased risk of renal toxicity.
4.4 Special warnings
Special care should be taken when treating dogs with marked renal insufficiency.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Use in animals less than 6 months of age, with a weight below 5 kg, or in aged animals, may involve additional risk.
If such use cannot be avoided, close veterinary supervision to monitor for gastrointestinal blood loss is necessary.
If side effects occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinary surgeon should be sought.
The recommended dose should not be exceeded.
2 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the medicinal product to animals
Tepoxalin is not water-soluble and becomes very sticky upon wetting.
If the oral lyophilisate disintegrates prematurely, wash hands thoroughly.
In case of ingestion of a number of oral lyophilisates by a person, the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Vomiting or diarrhoea may occur due to treatment.
Alopecia and erythema may also occur occasionally.
Typical undesirable side-effects associated with NSAIDs are vomiting, soft faeces/ diarrhoea, blood in faeces, reduced appetite and lethargy.
If there are such undesirable effects, treatment should be discontinued immediately.
In rare cases, particularly in older or in sensitive dogs, these undesirable effects may be serious or fatal.
During clinical trial testing of the product, the incidence of gastrointestinal reactions (diarrhoea/ vomiting) was 10%.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in pregnant or lactating bitches.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Tepoxalin must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants and substances with high plasma protein binding may compete for binding leading to potentially toxic effects.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
10 mg tepoxalin per kg bodyweight once daily.
The duration of treatment is dependent on clinical response.
After a treatment period of 7-10 days, the condition of the dog should be re- evaluated in order to establish the need for continuation of treatment.
Long term treatment should be under regular veterinary supervision.
The weight of the animal should be accurately determined before start of treatment.
Peel back foil to reveal a single oral lyophilisate in the form of a round tablet.
Ensure hands are dry to prevent the tablet from sticking to fingers.
Push the bottom of the blister and the tablet will pop out.
Place the tablet in the dog’ s mouth.
The tablet will disintegrate upon contact with moisture.
Keep the mouth of the dog closed for a few seconds to ensure complete tablet wetting.
Administer to dogs within 1-2 hours after feeding.
When this is not possible, or when dogs resist having the product placed directly into the mouth, put the tablet immediately before administration into a small amount of moistened food, or in a moist treat.
Ensure the food or treat containing the medication is completely consumed.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes)
At doses of 30 mg/ kg and above, oral administration of tepoxalin is associated with discoloured faeces ranging in colour from white to yellow, which is the result of unabsorbed drug.
NSAID overdosage is characterised by vomiting, soft faeces/ diarrhoea, blood in faeces, reduced appetite and lethargy.
In the case of overdosage discontinue therapy.
If gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected, administer gastric protectants.
If vomiting continues, administer anti-emetics.
Monitor the hematocrit frequently.
Maintain the animal on intravenous fluids and, if necessary, administer whole blood.
4.11 Withdrawal period
Not applicable

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Anti-inflammatory Products, Non Steroids ATCvet code:
QM01AE92
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Tepoxalin is a dual cyclooxygenase / 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor with anti-inflammatory activity.
Oral administration of 10 mg tepoxalin / kg bodyweight results in inhibition of prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Tepoxalin is rapidly (Tmax of approximately 2 hours) absorbed after oral administration in dogs.
At a therapeutic dose of 10 mg/ kg, the Cmax of tepoxalin was 1.08 ± 0.37 µg/ ml in dogs fed a low fat meal and 1.19 ± 0.29 µg/ ml in dogs fed a high fat meal.
Absorption of tepoxalin is facilitated via administration to dogs in a fed state.
Tepoxalin is extensively converted to its acid metabolite.
The acid metabolite is a potent, active cyclooxygenase inhibitor and prolongs the activity of the parent compound.
Plasma concentrations of the acid metabolite are higher than those of the parent compound in the dog.
No accumulation of tepoxalin or its acid metabolite was detected after multiple dosing over a broad dose range.
Tepoxalin and its metabolites are highly protein-bound, more than 98%.
Tepoxalin and its metabolites are excreted in the faeces (99%).
