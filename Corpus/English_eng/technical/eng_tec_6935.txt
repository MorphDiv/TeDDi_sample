The accounts list
The list of accounts to which Ekiga should register
Type of Service (TOS) byte on outgoing RTP IP packets
The Type of Service (TOS) byte on outgoing RTP IP packets. This byte is used by the network to provide some level of Quality of Service (QoS). Default value 184 (0xB8) correspond to Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB as defined in RFC 3246.
Listen port
The port to listen to for incoming connections. Ekiga needs to be restarted for the new value to take effect
Outbound Proxy
The SIP Outbound Proxy to use for outgoing calls
Forward calls to host
The host where calls should be forwarded if call forwarding is enabled
DTMF sending
Select the mode for sending DTMFs. The values can be 0 (for "RFC2833") and 1 (for "INFO")
The port to listen to for incoming connections. Ekiga needs to be restarted for the new value to take effect.
TCP port range

UDP port range
The range of UDP ports that Ekiga will use.
Enable H.245 tunneling
This enables H.245 Tunneling mode. In H.245 Tunneling mode H.245 messages are encapsulated into the H.225 channel (port 1720). This saves one TCP connection during calls. H.245 Tunneling was introduced in H.323v2 and Netmeeting does not support it. Using both Fast Start and H.245 Tunneling can crash some versions of Netmeeting.
Enable early H.245
This enables H.245 early in the setup
Enable 'Fast Start'

Select the H.239 Video Role. The values can be 0 (for "disable extended video"), 1 (for "allow per content role mask"), 2 (for "force presentation"), or 3 (for "force live role")
Select the mode for sending DTMFs. The values can be 0 (for "String"), 1 (for "Tone"), 2 (for "RFC2833"), or 3 (for "Q.931") (default is "String"). Choosing other values than "String" disables the Text Chat.

If enabled, all incoming calls will be forwarded to the host that is specified in the field below
Forward calls to the given host if busy
If enabled, all incoming calls will be forwarded to the host that is specified in the field below if you already are in a call or if you are in busy mode
Forward calls to the given host if no answer
If enabled, all incoming calls will be forwarded to the host that is specified in the field below if you do not answer the call

The video view before having switched to fullscreen
The video view before having switched to fullscreen (same values as video_view)
Remote video window size
The size of the remote video window
Remote video window position
The position of the remote video window
Maximum jitter buffer
The maximum jitter buffer size for audio reception (in ms)
The video codecs list
Maximum TX video bitrate
The maximum TX video bitrate in kbit/s. The video quality and the number of transmitted frames per second (depends on selected codec) will be dynamically adjusted above their minimum during calls to try to minimize the bandwidth to the given value
Maximum RX video bitrate
The maximum RX video bitrate in kbit/s. This value will be signaled to the peer endpoint that can adjust (if it supports it) its TX bitrate if it is above the signaled value
Temporal Spatial Trade Off
Whether to prefer to sustain the max. frame rate or lower it possibly in order to keep a minimum level of (spatial) quality for all frames. 0: Highest minimal quality, 31: lowest minimal quality

This is the Ekiga general configuration assistant. The following steps will set up Ekiga by asking a few simple questions.

Once you have completed these steps, you can always change them later by selecting Preferences in the Edit menu.
Welcome to Ekiga
Please enter your first name and your surname:
Your first name and surname will be used when connecting to other VoIP and videoconferencing software.
If you do not have a SIP or H323 account, ekiga can only be used on your local internal network (inside your company, for example). You will require an account if you want to be accessible to people on the Internet. Many web sites allow you to create an account. We suggest that you use a free ekiga.net account, which allows you to be joined by any person with a SIP account. If you want to call regular phone lines too, we suggest that you purchase an inexpensive call out account.

The following two pages allow you to create such accounts.
Introduction to Accounts
Ekiga.net Account
Please enter your username:
Please enter your password:
The username and password are used to login to your existing account at the ekiga.net free SIP service. If you do not have an ekiga.net SIP address yet, you may first create an account below. This will provide a SIP address that allows people to call you.

You may skip this step if you use an alternative SIP service, or if you would prefer to specify the login details later.
I do not want to sign up for the ekiga.net free service
Ekiga Call Out Account
Please enter your account ID:
Please enter your PIN code:
You can make calls to regular phones and cell numbers worldwide using Ekiga. To enable this, you need to do two things:
- First buy an account at the URL below.
- Then enter your account ID and PIN code.
The service will work only if your account is created using the URL in this dialog.
I do not want to sign up for the Ekiga Call Out service
Connection Type
Please choose your connection type:
56k Modem
ISDN
DSL/Cable (128 kbit/s uplink)
DSL/Cable (512 kbit/s uplink)
LAN
Keep current settings
The connection type will permit determining the best quality settings that Ekiga will use during calls. You can later change the settings individually in the preferences window.
Please choose the audio ringing device:
The audio ringing device is the device that will be used to play the ringing sound on incoming calls.
Please choose the audio output device:
The audio output device is the device that will be used to play audio during calls.
Please choose the audio input device:
The audio input device is the device that will be used to record your voice during calls.
Video Input Device
Please choose your video input device:
The video input device is the device that will be used to capture video during calls.
Configuration Complete
You have now finished the Ekiga configuration. All the settings can be changed in the Ekiga preferences. Enjoy!
