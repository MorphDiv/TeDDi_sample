EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
KEPIVANCE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Kepivance?
Kepivance is a vial containing a powder to be made into a solution for injection.
Each vial contains 6.25 mg of the active substance palifermin.
What is Kepivance used for?
Kepivance is used to decrease the frequency, duration and severity of oral mucositis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth ranging from soreness and redness to severe ulceration).
Kepivance is used in patients who are likely to develop severe mucositis because they have blood cancer, and are being treated with myeloablative therapy (treatments that destroy the bone marrow) and an autologous stem cell transplant (a transplant of their own blood-producing cells).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Kepivance used?
The use of Kepivance should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in anti-cancer therapy.
It is given as an intravenous injection (into a vein) at a dose of 60 micrograms per kilogram body weight per day, for a total of six doses.
Three doses are given on three consecutive days before myeloablative therapy, finishing 24 to 48 hours before the therapy.
The remaining three doses are given on three consecutive days after myeloablative therapy, with the first dose given on the day of the stem cell transplant.
Kepivance has not been studied in children, adolescents or the elderly.
How does Kepivance work?
The active substance in Kepivance, palifermin, is a growth factor that stimulates the ‘ epithelial’ cells that line the mouth and gastrointestinal tract to grow and develop.
Palifermin is very similar to a natural growth factor found in the body called keratinocyte growth factor (KGF).
Epithelial cells in the mouth are normally replaced by the body every few days.
In patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the cells are not replaced as quickly, and this leads to the development of mucositis.
Kepivance stimulates the growth of these cells, helping to reduce the incidence, severity and duration of oral mucositis in cancer patients undergoing intensive therapy.
Palifermin is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’.
The palifermin is made by a bacterium that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce palifermin.
The replacement palifermin acts in same way as naturally produced KGF.

Kepivance has been studied in 212 patients receiving high-dose cytotoxic therapy for a blood cancer (mostly non-Hodgkin’ s lymphoma).
Palifermin was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment).
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of days during which patients experienced severe oral mucositis.
What benefit has Kepivance shown during the studies?
The average length of time for which patients had severe oral mucositis was significantly less with Kepivance (3.7 days) than with placebo (10.4 days).
Patients receiving Kepivance also reported less mouth and throat soreness with improved swallowing, drinking, eating and talking.
What is the risk associated with Kepivance?
The most common side effects with Kepivance (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are taste perversion (altered taste), mouth/ tongue thickness or discolouration, rash, pruritus (itching), erythema (redness), arthralgia (joint pain), oedema (fluid retention), pain and fever.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Kepivance, see the Package Leaflet.
Kepivance should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to palifermin, proteins produced by Escherichia coli (a bacterium) or any of the other ingredients.
Why has Kepivance been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Kepivance’ s benefits are greater than its risks when used to decrease the incidence, duration and severity of oral mucositis in patients with haematological malignancies receiving myeloablative therapy associated with a high incidence of severe mucositis and requiring autologous stem cell support.
They recommended that Kepivance be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Kepivance:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Kepivance to Amgen Europe B. V. on 25 October 2005.
