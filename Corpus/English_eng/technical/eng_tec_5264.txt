References Explained

You can pass variable to function by reference, so that function could modify its arguments.
The syntax is as follows:
function foo ($var) {$var++;} $a=5; foo ($a); / / $a is 6 here
Following things can be passed by reference:
Variable, i.e. foo( $a)
New statement, i.e. foo( new foobar())
Reference, returned from a function, i.e.:
function bar() {$a = 5; return $a;} foo(bar());
Any other expression should not be passed by reference, as the result is undefined.
For example, the following examples of passing by reference are invalid:
function bar() / / Note the missing {$a = 5; return $a;} foo(bar()); foo($a = 5) / / Expression, not variable foo(5) / / Constant, not variable
