Remote network address
This is the remote network to which the connection should be going. Use this with a PPTP connection to set another network besides that where the retrieved IP is located.
/
Prefix (netmask) of the remote network
This is the netmask of the remote network. The value describes how many bits are used for the network part. For example / 24 stands for the netmask 255.255.255.0 (3*8 bits)

Fixes the path MTU discovery problem by inserting a special firewall rule.
Problem: TCP connections using the PPTP Client host as a hop in the route (such as via normal routing, NAT or IP masquerading) freeze once they attempt to transfer large amounts of data. Diagnosis: path MTU discovery may not be working, due to hosts on the route refusing to forward ICMP fragmentation needed responses.
