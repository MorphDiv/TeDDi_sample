(PHP 3 = 3.0.13, PHP 4)
Creates a temporary file with an unique name in write mode, returning a file handle similar to the one returned by fopen().
The file is automatically removed when closed (using fclose()), or when the script ends.
For details, consult your system documentation on the tmpfile( 3) function, as well as the stdio.h header file.
Example 1. tmpfile() example
$temp = tmpfile(); fwrite($temp, "writing to tempfile"); fclose($temp); / / this removes the file
