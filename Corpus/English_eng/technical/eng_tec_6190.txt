system information
This page displays information about Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) Interfaces and the attached SCSI devices.
The exact information displayed is system-dependent. On some systems SCSI information cannot be displayed yet.
On & Linux;, this information is read from / proc/ scsi/ scsi, which is only available if the / proc pseudo-filesystem is compiled into the kernel. A listing of all SCSI devices known to the kernel is shown.
The devices are sorted numerically by their host, channel, and ID numbers.
The user cannot modify any settings on this page.
