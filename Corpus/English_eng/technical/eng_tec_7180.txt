User manual for GHex
GHex is a simple binary editor. It lets users view and edit a binary file in both hex and ascii with a multiple level undo/redo mechanism. Features include find and replace functions, conversion between binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal values, and use of an alternative, user-configurable MDI concept that lets users edit multiple documents with multiple views of each.
