EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
KINZALMONO
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Kinzalmono?
Kinzalmono is a medicine that contains the active substance telmisartan.
It is available as white tablets (round:
20 mg; oblong:
40 and 80 mg).
What is Kinzalmono used for?
Kinzalmono is used in adults who have essential hypertension (high blood pressure). ‘ Essential ’ means that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Kinzalmono used?
Kinzalmono is taken by mouth, with or without food.
The usual recommended dose is 40 mg once a day, but some patients may benefit from using a 20-mg dose.
If the target blood pressure is not reached, the dose can be increased to 80 mg, or another medicine for hypertension can be added, such as hydrochlorothiazide.
How does Kinzalmono work?
The active substance in Kinzalmono, telmisartan, is an ‘ angiotensin II receptor antagonist’, which means that it blocks the action of a hormone in the body called angiotensin II.
Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels).
By blocking the receptors to which angiotensin II normally attaches, telmisartan stops the hormone having an effect, allowing the blood vessels to widen.
This allows the blood pressure to drop, reducing the risk caused by high blood pressure, such as having a stroke.
How has Kinzalmono been studied?
Kinzalmono has been studied in 1,647 patients who were treated with telmisartan either alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.
Kinzalmono was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) and with other medicines for hypertension (atenolol, lisinopril, enalapril and amlodipine).
The main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in diastolic blood pressure (the blood pressure measured between two heartbeats).

What benefit has Kinzalmono shown during the studies?
Kinzalmono was more effective than placebo at reducing diastolic blood pressure and had similar effects to the other medicines for hypertension.
What is the risk associated with Kinzalmono?
Side effects with Kinzalmono are not common.
However, the following side effects are seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 1,000: hyperkalaemia (high blood potassium levels), syncope (fainting), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), vertigo (a spinning sensation), hypotension (low blood pressure), dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), abdominal (tummy) pain, diarrhoea, dry mouth, dyspepsia (heartburn), flatulence (gas), hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), pruritus (itching), myalgia (muscle pain), renal impairment (kidney problems) including renal failure (kidney failure), and chest pain.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Kinzalmono, see the Package Leaflet.
Kinzalmono should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to telmisartan or any of the other ingredients.
It must not be used in women who are more than three months pregnant or who are breast-feeding.
Its use during the first three months of pregnancy is not recommended.
Kinzalmono must not be used in people who have severe liver problems or bile problems.
Why has Kinzalmono been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Kinzalmono’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of essential hypertension in adults.
The Committee recommended that Kinzalmono be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Kinzalmono:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Kinzalmono on 16 December 1998.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 16 December 2003 and on 16 December 2008.
The marketing authorisation holder is Bayer Healthcare AG.
