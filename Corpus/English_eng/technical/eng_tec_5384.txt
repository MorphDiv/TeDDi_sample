In addition to normal ODBC support, the Unified ODBC functions in PHP allow you to access several databases that have borrowed the semantics of the ODBC API to implement their own API.
Instead of maintaining multiple database drivers that were all nearly identical, these drivers have been unified into a single set of ODBC functions.
The following databases are supported by the Unified ODBC functions:
Adabas D, IBM DB2, iODBC, Solid, and Sybase SQL Anywhere.
Note:
There is no ODBC involved when connecting to the above databases.
The functions that you use to speak natively to them just happen to share the same names and syntax as the ODBC functions.
The exception to this is iODBC.
Building PHP with iODBC support enables you to use any ODBC-compliant drivers with your PHP applications. iODBC is maintained by OpenLink Software.
More information on iODBC, as well as a HOWTO, is available at www.iodbc.org.
To access any of the supported databases you need to have the required libraries installed.
Please see the Database installation options chapter for more information about configuring PHP with these databases.
The windows version of PHP The windows version of PHP has built in support for this extension.
You do not need to load any additional extension in order to use these functions.
The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini.
