GNOME 3.10 Release Notes
Creative Commons Share Alike 3.0
Introducing GNOME 3.10
The GNOME project is proud to present GNOME 3.10. The release comes six months after 3.8, and contains 34786 changes by approximately 985 contributors. It contains major new features as well as a large collection of smaller enhancements. 3.10 provides an improved experience for users, as well as new capabilities for application developers.
New features in GNOME 3.10 include:
Wayland

Integrated System Status
GNOME 3.10 features a new, redesigned system status area. In previous versions, the system status area was made up of a series of menus in the corner of the top bar. The new system status area replaces this with a single menu. This allows you to quickly get an overview of the state of your device, and provides a more focused top bar which only displays information that you care about. Among many improvements, the new menu provides easier mouse interaction, privacy enhancements, a new screen brightness slider, and a better airplane mode.
Header Bars
A new interface element has been introduced in 3.10: header bars. These merge titlebars and toolbars into a single element, giving more screen space to window content. Header bars also allow more dynamic application interfaces whose controls adjust to the current view, and they ensure that window close buttons are always present, irrespective of whether a window is maximized or unmaximized.
New Applications
GNOME's mission to create a new set of core applications continues in GNOME 3.10. There is a whole collection of new applications in this version, including

GNOME 3.10 is packed with other new features and enhancements
Updates to the Core GNOME 3 User Experience
GNOME 3.10 includes numerous other new features and enhancements. Here are some of the other improvements that can be found in the latest version.
Paginated Application View
The application launching view now has pages rather than being scrolled, and has many other layout and animation improvements. Pages make it easier to find the application you are looking for, and integrates application folders much more effectively. A lot of time has been spent making this part of GNOME 3 look and feel great.
Customize Your Lock Screen
From 3.10, it is possible to set a different image for your lock screen. This gives greater scope for personalization, and helps to differentiate the lock screen from your session. The lock screen image can be changed from the
Fine Scrolling
Scroll bars in GNOME now feature a new mode that allows fine scrolling. This allows precise movements over small distances, and is particularly useful if the scrolled area is very large. To activate fine scrolling, just click and hold on a scroll bar handle, or click on the handle while holding
Settings

More Beautiful, Legible Text
Cantarell, the GNOME font, has had a big update for 3.10. Glyph coverage has been extended so that more languages are supported, and the shape and spacing of existing letters has been improved. The result is a more beautiful interface font that is easier to read.
High-Resolution Display Support
High-resolution displays (also known as high-density displays) are becoming increasingly common. GNOME 3.10 introduces support for these types of displays, and will now automatically scale what is displayed on the screen to compensate for increased display density. This ensures that controls and content appear at the correct size, and that interfaces are usable. This work would not have been possible without
Smart Card Support
Smart cards are now supported as an alternate way to log in and unlock. Primarily of interest to enterprise GNOME deployments, smart cards can be configured as the primary authentication method (and password access can be disabled). It is also possible to configure whether removing a smart card locks the device or logs the user out.
Magnifier Focus and Caret Tracking
Magnifier users can enjoy a more effective experience with the addition of caret and focus tracking. With this improvement, the magnifier will move to keep focused widgets and the text entry caret in view. This makes it much easier to type and navigate using the keyboard while using the magnifier.
Other Improvements
There are many other smaller enhancements to the core user experience for 3.10. These include:
An improved login screen, with a better layout and nicer transitions.
Baseline alignment of text labels, resulting in more evenly and consistently aligned text.
A keyboard navigable drop-down calendar, and sliders in the system status menu that can be used with the
Better looking lock screen notifications.
A screen reader can be turned on or off at any time by pressing
Web applications now have header bars with some useful controls for navigation.
Consolidated log out and power off dialogs, which now incorporate warnings about other logged in users or busy applications (these warnings were previously included in a separate set of dialog windows).
A new default background.
New features for those working with GNOME technologies
What's new for developers, system administrators and distributors
GNOME 3.10 introduces a number of new features and enhancements for those working with GNOME technologies.
With GNOME 3.10, it is possible to run a GNOME session as well as GNOME applications using Wayland. This support is experimental and is intended for testing purposes only.

New GTK+ Widgets
GTK+ 3.10 introduces a collection of new interface widgets. These provide additional abilities, such as adding animated transitions, as well as greater flexibility. In some cases they provide easy-to-use alternatives to existing widgets. The new widgets have been created in line with the latest GNOME 3 application designs.






Composite Widget Templates
Composite widget templates are a new feature in GTK+ 3.10. The new feature allows composite widgets to be defined using XML, which avoids the need to construct them manually. GTK+ is already taking advantage of this feature to define its own composite widgets, such as

Baseline Alignment in GTK+
GTK+ 3.10 introduces baseline alignment for text. This allows text labels to be properly vertically aligned in relation to containers, which has the added advantage of ensuring consistent text alignment.

The GNOME community is proud to present GNOME 3.8. This new release features numerous new features as well as a host of smaller enhancements.
3.8 is the result of 6 months of work by the GNOME Project and contains 35936 contributions by approximately 960 people. We think that it is the best version of GNOME to date.
Here are some of the improvements that can be found in the new release.

Improved Animation Rendering
GNOME 3.8 features a significant technological breakthrough in the way that animated graphics are rendered. By improving the coordination between the components responsible for displaying animated graphics, far greater efficiency and performance has been achieved. The result of this work is smooth and robust visual transitions and window resizing. Smoother video playback will also be found under some conditions.
Classic Mode
Classic mode is a new feature for those people who prefer a more traditional desktop experience. Built entirely from GNOME 3 technologies, it adds a number of features such as an application menu, a places menu and a window switcher along the bottom of the screen. Each of these features can be used individually or in combination with other GNOME extensions.
Details
GNOME 3.8 includes a huge number of smaller bug fixes and enhancements. Many details have been addressed to give a more polished experience, including new animated transitions, improved visuals and usability fixes. Many of these improvements were made as a part of the Every Detail Matters initiative, which fixed nearly 60 bugs during the 3.8 development cycle.
Input Methods
Integrated input methods were introduced for the first time in the previous release, GNOME 3.6. They have been the subject of a great deal of work since then, with new features being added as well as bug fixes. These include a new on screen display for input method switching, new candidate character popups, new

GNOME's applications have had a lot of improvements for 3.8. We are also releasing previews of two new applications.


In addition to this major achievement,
WebKit2 includes a new plugins system, which means that Flash is now supported. Plugins are also isolated, improving stability.

The page search interface has been improved, and is now more consistent with other GNOME 3 applications.
Media controls for HTML5 content have been revamped, so that they look better and are easier to use.
An undo close tab action has been added: this is a convenient way to get tabs back that you have accidentally closed.
The toolbar has gained a new tab button.


Automatic USB redirection is now included in all new virtual machines, and can be added to existing ones. This makes it possible to use USB devices (cameras, flash drive, etc) from inside a virtual machine.

Windows XP and Windows 7 express installations have been substantially improved. Copy and paste between the host system and the virtual machine now works out of the box, as does automatic adjustment of the virtual machine's screen resolution. Disk usage has also been made more efficient.
It is now possible to connect to virtual machines running on
There have been many user interface improvements and additions, including the ability to pause multiple virtual machines at the same time, improved multi-selection of virtual machines, additional options in the remote connection assistant, and support for changing the CD-ROM device/ISO from the properties view.

For the very first time, GNOME comes with support for input methods out of the box. It is no longer necessary to manually choose and install an input method framework that may not fit very well into the overall user experience. Input methods are now a part of the core GNOME user experience, just like keyboard layouts.
Feedback Wanted!
Integrated input methods is a major new feature, and changes functionality that is important to many users. We recognize this and want to hear about how you want the new feature to develop in the future.

Lock Screen
The lock screen is a major new feature for GNOME 3.6. It shows an attractive image on the screen while your computer is locked and also provides useful functionality, such as the display of notifications and the ability to control media playback.
The lock screen means that you can see what is happening while your computer is locked, and it allows you to get a summary of what has been happening while you have been away. (This functionality can be disabled via the

Major updates make it better looking and easier to use.
The message tray has received some major updates for GNOME 3.6. Many of these changes were based on feedback and testing, which indicated some interaction issues with the old tray design.
The new tray is clearer, better looking, and easier to interact with. It refines the existing design so that it is less error-prone and more satisfying to use. Instead of overlapping the viewing area, the new tray slides the view up, revealing the tray below. The items in the tray are also bigger, clearer, and don't move around, making them easier to use.
The way that the tray is triggered has also been altered. The hot corner – which many people had problems with – has been replaced. Instead, the whole of the bottom screen edge now acts as a trigger area; letting the mouse rest there for a short period will cause the tray to appear. We plan to improve this behavior in subsequent releases.
For the first time, the message tray is also accessible with the keyboard. Press
Smarter, more noticeable, easier to dismiss.
GNOME's notification pop-ups have had quite a few refinements for 3.6. For the new release, we have made them:
Smarter: notifications are smarter in GNOME 3.6. If you are running a full screen application or game, we only show you your important notifications. All other notifications are delayed until you stop using your full screen application.
More noticeable: we have tweaked the behavior of notification pop-ups to make sure that you see all your notifications. No longer will you miss out on a notification as we only hide a notification after we know you have interacted with the system.
Easier to dismiss: notification bubbles now feature close buttons. This makes it much clearer how to dismiss a notification.
Better looking main interface, many settings have also been improved and extended.
GNOME 3.6 comes with lots of changes to
The main
Background
We looked at how someone would select a background in 3.4, and noticed a number of issues. It was quite easy to accidentally change the current background, while selecting a new background was quite difficult.
In 3.6, we show the current background as a large thumbnail. When clicked, you can easily select either a background, one of your pictures or a background color. To make your choice easier, we have made the previews bigger.
We have also refreshed the default background in 3.6, and have updated the choice of alternative backgrounds to include new images. Setting a single color as a background has also been improved and features a new set of colors.

User Accounts
A major new feature in GNOME 3.6 is the addition of Enterprise logins (also called Active Directory or Kerberos logins). This allows GNOME to be used in centrally managed and corporate environments in a much more integrated manner. Users can enroll their computer with an enterprise network, and use their enterprise user name and password to log into GNOME.

The network settings panel has been improved to make it easier to select wireless connections. A new list now gives access to all available and remembered wireless networks. You can inspect and forget access points, regardless whether they are currently in range or not.

User Menu
The user menu has been refined for the latest GNOME release, making it more compact and adding functionality that was missed by many users. After reviewing the performance of this menu, and taking user feedback into account, the decision was made to introduce the

The Overview
The most noticeable difference in 3.6 is the first version of 'The Overview'. While this is still an evolving design, it already is a solid improvement to the user experience.
The previously blank start page was replaced by a grid that holds your most visited pages. Your favorite pages are now easier to access, especially on touch devices, and valuable screen real estate is used! And if an unwanted page ends up there, you can remove it from the grid by clicking on the

Now with more full and more screen!

Other Bits and Pieces
As usual there are lots of additional features and bug fixes, too numerous to mention: automatic session recovery, tab-less mode, Do Not Track, using SoupTLD to make the URL completion smarter (so it can automatically figure out that
No more worries to activate accessibility!
Accessibility Always On
So far, users that needed any assistive technology had to activate accessibility support. This was cumbersome, because they had to figure out how to do that without the help of any assistive technology that they may need.
Starting with GNOME 3.6, the accessibility stack has been highly integrated into the core, so users that need any assistive technology can use GNOME right from the start.
This feature is an important milestone in GNOME's mission to deliver a free and open desktop to everyone. More than ever, it can be stated that GNOME accessibility is built-in and not bolted-on.
To summarize:
Built-in and always ready accessibility support.
Users don't notice any difference unless they use any Assistive Technology.

New powerful visual options.
Brightness, Contrast, Inversion and Grayscale
GNOME 3.6 brings inverse video, brightness, contrast, and grayscale options to the GNOME magnifier. The combination of these options is very powerful and is particularly useful for people with low-vision, any degree of photophobia, or just for using the computer under adverse lighting conditions.
Braille support revamped.
Improved Braille Support in Orca

Web navigation more accessible.
Web Accessibility Improvements
WebKitGTK+ received a lot of attention and many bug fixes that have resulted in a better accessibility support. We are quite pleased with the progress thus far towards making content viewed in Web compellingly accessible for Orca users.

3.4 is the second GNOME release since 3.0 back in April 2011. It brings a large number of improvements to the user experience, including many bug fixes and small enhancements. The result is a shinier, more polished, more reliable GNOME 3.
This release also contains some important new developments. Our applications have been a major focus for recent design and development effort, and a host of applications have had significant updates for this release.

Other highlights for this release include a new document search facility, a new application called Boxes, video calling, and a new animated background that updates over the course of the day. Enjoy!
Our applications have been a major theme for this release cycle. The new applications that were released in 3.2 have all received major updates that make them better looking and more pleasurable to use. Several existing applications have also received an overhaul so that they are more consistent and integrated with GNOME 3.
