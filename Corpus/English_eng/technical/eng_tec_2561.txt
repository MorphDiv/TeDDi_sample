(PHP 4 = 4.0.1)
Generates the cyclic redundancy checksum polynomial of 32-bit lengths of the str.
This is usually used to validate the integrity of data being transmitted.
Note:
Because PHP' s integer type is signed, and many crc32 checksums will result in negative integers, you need to use the "%u "formatter of sprintf() or printf() to get the string representation of the unsigned crc32 checksum.
Example 1.
Displaying a crc32 checksum
?php $checksum = crc32( "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog ."); printf("%u\n", $checksum);?
