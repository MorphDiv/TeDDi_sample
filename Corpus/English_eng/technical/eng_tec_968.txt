Defining Custom Colours
If you want, you can mix a custom colour and add it to a colour table.

Format - Area
and click the
Colours
tab.
A table of the predefined colours is displayed.
Changes made to the standard colour table are permanent and are saved automatically.
Choose a colour from the table that is similar to the one you want to mix.
The colour appears in the upper preview box to the right of the table.
Select either the RGB or CMYK colour model in the box below the preview boxes.
%PRODUCTNAME uses only the RGB colour model for printing in colour.
The CMYK controls are provided only to ease the input of colour values using CMYK notation.
The RGB colour model mixes red, green and blue light to create colours on a computer screen.
In the RGB model, the three colour components are additive and can have values ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
The CMYK colour model combines Cyan (C), Magenta (M), Yellow (Y), and blacK (K, also used for &quot; Key &quot; ) to create colours for printing.
The four colours of the CMYK models are subtractive and are defined as percentages.
Black corresponds to 100 % and white to 0 %.
Enter a numerical value in the boxes next to the colour components.
The new colour appears in the preview box directly above the colour model box.
