Cannot open the file %1 and load the string list. This file seems not to be a valid old kfr file or it is broken.

You have selected %1 as the encoding of the files. Selecting the correct encoding is very important as if you have files that have some other encoding than the selected one, after a replace you may damage those files. In case you do not know the encoding of your files, select utf8 and enable the creation of backup files. This setting will autodetect utf8 and utf16 files, but the changed files will be converted to utf8.

Cannot open the file %1 and load the string list.
File %1 seems not to be written in new kfr format. Remember that the old kfr format will be soon abandoned. You can convert your old rules files by simply saving them with kfilereplace.
Warning
The format of kfr files has been changed; attempting to load %1. Please see the KFilereplace manual for details. Do you want to load a search-and-replace list of strings?

There are no strings to search and replace.

Base folder for operations of search/ replace. Insert path string here by hand or use the search button.
Shell-like wildcards. Example: "*. html; *. txt; *. xml".
Insert the minimum file size you want to search, or leave it unchecked if you do not want a minimum size limit.
Insert the maximum file size you want to search, or leave it unchecked if you do not want a maximum size limit.
Insert the minimum value for file access date that you want to search, or leave it unchecked if you do not want a minimum limit.
Insert the maximum value for file access date that you want to search, or leave it unchecked if you do not want a maximum limit.

Enable this option if your search is case sensitive.
Enable this option to search in sub folders too.
Enable this option when you are searching for a string and you are only interested to know if the string is present or not in the current file.
If set, then if kfilereplace encounters a symbolic link it treats it like a normal folder or file.
Enable this option to ignore hidden files or folders.
If this option is enabled, KFR will show even the names of the files in which no string has been found or replaced.
Allows you to apply Qt-like regular expressions on the search string. Note that a complex regular expression could affect speed performance.
Enable "commands". For example: if search string is "user" and replace string is the command "[$user: uid$]", KFR will substitute "user" with the uid of the user.
Enable this option if you want leave original files untouched.
Enable this option if you want to be asked for single string replacement confirmation.
Enable this option to perform replacing as a simulation, i. e. without making any changes to files.
Select search-only mode.
Select search-and-replace mode.
Insert here a string you want search for.
Insert here the string that KFR will use to replace the search string.
