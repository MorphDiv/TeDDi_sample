Protocol: %1
Date and time: %1
Additional information: %1
Possible causes:
Possible solutions:
Contact your appropriate computer support system, whether the system administrator, or technical support group for further assistance.
Contact the administrator of the server for further assistance.
Check your access permissions on this resource.
Your access permissions may be inadequate to perform the requested operation on this resource.
The file may be in use (and thus locked) by another user or application.
Check to make sure that no other application or user is using the file or has locked the file.
Although unlikely, a hardware error may have occurred.
You may have encountered a bug in the program.
This is most likely to be caused by a bug in the program. Please consider submitting a full bug report as detailed below.
Update your software to the latest version. Your distribution should provide tools to update your software.
When all else fails, please consider helping the KDE team or the third party maintainer of this software by submitting a high quality bug report. If the software is provided by a third party, please contact them directly. Otherwise, first look to see if the same bug has been submitted by someone else by searching at the KDE bug reporting website. If not, take note of the details given above, and include them in your bug report, along with as many other details as you think might help.
There may have been a problem with your network connection.
There may have been a problem with your network configuration. If you have been accessing the Internet with no problems recently, this is unlikely.
There may have been a problem at some point along the network path between the server and this computer.
Try again, either now or at a later time.
A protocol error or incompatibility may have occurred.
Ensure that the resource exists, and try again.
The specified resource may not exist.
You may have incorrectly typed the location.
Double-check that you have entered the correct location and try again.
Check your network connection status.
Cannot Open Resource For Reading
This means that the contents of the requested file or folder %1 could not be retrieved, as read access could not be obtained.
You may not have permissions to read the file or open the folder.
Cannot Open Resource For Writing
This means that the file, %1, could not be written to as requested, because access with permission to write could not be obtained.
Cannot Initiate the %1 Protocol
Unable to Launch Process
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol could not be started. This is usually due to technical reasons.
The program which provides compatibility with this protocol may not have been updated with your last update of KDE. This can cause the program to be incompatible with the current version and thus not start.
Internal Error
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an internal error.
Improperly Formatted URL
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered was not properly formatted. The format of a URL is generally as follows: protocol: / /user: password@www. example. org: port/ folder/ filename. extension? query=value
Unsupported Protocol %1
The protocol %1 is not supported by the KDE programs currently installed on this computer.
The requested protocol may not be supported.
The versions of the %1 protocol supported by this computer and the server may be incompatible.
You may perform a search on the Internet for a KDE program (called a kioslave or ioslave) which supports this protocol. Places to search include http: / /kde-apps. org/ and http: / /freshmeat. net/.
URL Does Not Refer to a Resource.
Protocol is a Filter Protocol
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered did not refer to a specific resource.
KDE is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol; the protocol specified is only for use in such situations, however this is not one of these situations. This is a rare event, and is likely to indicate a programming error.
Unsupported Action: %1
The requested action is not supported by the KDE program which is implementing the %1 protocol.
This error is very much dependent on the KDE program. The additional information should give you more information than is available to the KDE input/ output architecture.
Attempt to find another way to accomplish the same outcome.
File Expected
The request expected a file, however the folder %1 was found instead.
This may be an error on the server side.
Folder Expected
The request expected a folder, however the file %1 was found instead.
File or Folder Does Not Exist
The specified file or folder %1 does not exist.
The requested file could not be created because a file with the same name already exists.
Try moving the current file out of the way first, and then try again.
Delete the current file and try again.
Choose an alternate filename for the new file.
The requested folder could not be created because a folder with the same name already exists.
Try moving the current folder out of the way first, and then try again.
Delete the current folder and try again.
Choose an alternate name for the new folder.
Unknown Host
An unknown host error indicates that the server with the requested name, %1, could not be located on the Internet.
The name that you typed, %1, may not exist: it may be incorrectly typed.
Access Denied
Access was denied to the specified resource, %1.
You may have supplied incorrect authentication details or none at all.
Your account may not have permission to access the specified resource.
Retry the request and ensure your authentication details are entered correctly.
Write Access Denied
This means that an attempt to write to the file %1 was rejected.
Unable to Enter Folder
This means that an attempt to enter (in other words, to open) the requested folder %1 was rejected.
Folder Listing Unavailable
Protocol %1 is not a Filesystem
This means that a request was made which requires determining the contents of the folder, and the KDE program supporting this protocol is unable to do so.
Cyclic Link Detected
UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location. KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was (perhaps in a roundabout way) linked to itself.
Delete one part of the loop in order that it does not cause an infinite loop, and try again.
Request Aborted By User
The request was not completed because it was aborted.
Retry the request.
Cyclic Link Detected During Copy
UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location. During the requested copy operation, KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was (perhaps in a roundabout way) linked to itself.
Could Not Create Network Connection
Could Not Create Socket
This is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications (a socket) could not be created.
The network connection may be incorrectly configured, or the network interface may not be enabled.
Connection to Server Refused
The server %1 refused to allow this computer to make a connection.
The server, while currently connected to the Internet, may not be configured to allow requests.
The server, while currently connected to the Internet, may not be running the requested service (%1).
A network firewall (a device which restricts Internet requests), either protecting your network or the network of the server, may have intervened, preventing this request.
Connection to Server Closed Unexpectedly
Although a connection was established to %1, the connection was closed at an unexpected point in the communication.
A protocol error may have occurred, causing the server to close the connection as a response to the error.
URL Resource Invalid
Protocol %1 is not a Filter Protocol
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered did not refer to a valid mechanism of accessing the specific resource, %1%2.
KDE is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol. This request specified a protocol be used as such, however this protocol is not capable of such an action. This is a rare event, and is likely to indicate a programming error.
Unable to Initialize Input/ Output Device
Could Not Mount Device
The requested device could not be initialized ("mounted"). The reported error was: %1
The device may not be ready, for example there may be no media in a removable media device (i. e. no CD-ROM in a CD drive), or in the case of a peripheral/ portable device, the device may not be correctly connected.
You may not have permissions to initialize ("mount") the device. On UNIX systems, often system administrator privileges are required to initialize a device.
Check that the device is ready; removable drives must contain media, and portable devices must be connected and powered on.; and try again.
Unable to Uninitialize Input/ Output Device
Could Not Unmount Device
The requested device could not be uninitialized ("unmounted"). The reported error was: %1
The device may be busy, that is, still in use by another application or user. Even such things as having an open browser window on a location on this device may cause the device to remain in use.
You may not have permissions to uninitialize ("unmount") the device. On UNIX systems, system administrator privileges are often required to uninitialize a device.
Check that no applications are accessing the device, and try again.
Cannot Read From Resource
This means that although the resource, %1, was able to be opened, an error occurred while reading the contents of the resource.
You may not have permissions to read from the resource.
Cannot Write to Resource
This means that although the resource, %1, was able to be opened, an error occurred while writing to the resource.
You may not have permissions to write to the resource.
Could Not Listen for Network Connections
Could Not Bind
This is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications (a socket) could not be established to listen for incoming network connections.
Could Not Listen
Could Not Accept Network Connection
This is a fairly technical error in which an error occurred while attempting to accept an incoming network connection.
You may not have permissions to accept the connection.
Could Not Login: %1
An attempt to login to perform the requested operation was unsuccessful.
Could Not Determine Resource Status
Could Not Stat Resource
An attempt to determine information about the status of the resource %1, such as the resource name, type, size, etc., was unsuccessful.
The specified resource may not have existed or may not be accessible.
Could Not Cancel Listing
FIXME: Document this
Could Not Create Folder
An attempt to create the requested folder failed.
The location where the folder was to be created may not exist.
Could Not Remove Folder
An attempt to remove the specified folder, %1, failed.
The specified folder may not exist.
The specified folder may not be empty.
Ensure that the folder exists and is empty, and try again.
Could Not Resume File Transfer
The specified request asked that the transfer of file %1 be resumed at a certain point of the transfer. This was not possible.
The protocol, or the server, may not support file resuming.
Retry the request without attempting to resume transfer.
Could Not Rename Resource
An attempt to rename the specified resource %1 failed.
Could Not Alter Permissions of Resource
An attempt to alter the permissions on the specified resource %1 failed.
Could Not Change Ownership of Resource
An attempt to change the ownership of the specified resource %1 failed.
Could Not Delete Resource

Unexpected Program Termination
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol has unexpectedly terminated.
Out of Memory
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol could not obtain the memory required to continue.
Unknown Proxy Host
While retrieving information about the specified proxy host, %1, an Unknown Host error was encountered. An unknown host error indicates that the requested name could not be located on the Internet.
There may have been a problem with your network configuration, specifically your proxy's hostname. If you have been accessing the Internet with no problems recently, this is unlikely.
Double-check your proxy settings and try again.
Authentication Failed: Method %1 Not Supported
Although you may have supplied the correct authentication details, the authentication failed because the method that the server is using is not supported by the KDE program implementing the protocol %1.
Please file a bug at http: / /bugs. kde. org/ to inform the KDE team of the unsupported authentication method.
Request Aborted
Internal Error in Server
The program on the server which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an internal error: %2.
This is most likely to be caused by a bug in the server program. Please consider submitting a full bug report as detailed below.
Contact the administrator of the server to advise them of the problem.
If you know who the authors of the server software are, submit the bug report directly to them.
Timeout Error
Although contact was made with the server, a response was not received within the amount of time allocated for the request as follows: Timeout for establishing a connection: %1 seconds Timeout for receiving a response: %2 seconds Timeout for accessing proxy servers: %3 seconds Please note that you can alter these timeout settings in the KDE System Settings, by selecting Network Settings - > Connection Preferences.
The server was too busy responding to other requests to respond.
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an unknown error: %2.
Unknown Interruption
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an interruption of an unknown type: %2.
Could Not Delete Original File
The requested operation required the deleting of the original file, most likely at the end of a file move operation. The original file %1 could not be deleted.
Could Not Delete Temporary File
The requested operation required the creation of a temporary file in which to save the new file while being downloaded. This temporary file %1 could not be deleted.
Could Not Rename Original File
The requested operation required the renaming of the original file %1, however it could not be renamed.
Could Not Rename Temporary File
The requested operation required the creation of a temporary file %1, however it could not be created.
Could Not Create Link
Could Not Create Symbolic Link
The requested symbolic link %1 could not be created.
No Content
Disk Full
The requested file %1 could not be written to as there is inadequate disk space.
Free up enough disk space by 1) deleting unwanted and temporary files; 2) archiving files to removable media storage such as CD-Recordable discs; or 3) obtain more storage capacity.
Source and Destination Files Identical
The operation could not be completed because the source and destination files are the same file.
Choose a different filename for the destination file.

This option enables some convenient features for saving files with extensions: Any extension specified in the %1 text area will be updated if you change the file type to save in. If no extension is specified in the %2 text area when you click Save, %3 will be added to the end of the filename (if the filename does not already exist). This extension is based on the file type that you have chosen to save in. If you do not want KDE to supply an extension for the filename, you can either turn this option off or you can suppress it by adding a period (.) to the end of the filename (the period will be automatically removed). If unsure, keep this option enabled as it makes your files more manageable.

KWallet - The KDE Wallet System
Welcome to KWallet, the KDE Wallet System. KWallet allows you to store your passwords and other personal information on disk in an encrypted file, preventing others from viewing the information. This wizard will tell you about KWallet and help you configure it for the first time.
& Basic setup (recommended)
& Advanced setup
Various applications may attempt to use the KDE wallet to store passwords or other information such as web form data and cookies. If you would like these applications to use the wallet, you must enable it now and choose a password. The password you choose cannot be recovered if it is lost, and will allow anyone who knows it to obtain all the information contained in the wallet.
Yes, I wish to use the KDE wallet to store my personal information.
Enter a new password:
Verify password:
The KDE Wallet system stores your data in a wallet file on your local hard disk. The data is only written in encrypted form, presently using the blowfish algorithm with your password as the key. When a wallet is opened, the wallet manager application will launch and display an icon in the system tray. You can use this application to manage your wallets. It even permits you to drag wallets and wallet contents, allowing you to easily copy a wallet to a remote system.
The KDE Wallet system allows you to control the level of security of your personal data. Some of these settings do impact usability. While the default settings are generally acceptable for most users, you may wish to change some of them. You may further tune these settings from the KWallet control module.
