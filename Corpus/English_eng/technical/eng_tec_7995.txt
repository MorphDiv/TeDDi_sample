ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Corlentor 5 mg film-coated tablets
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
One film-coated tablet contains 5 mg ivabradine (equivalent to 5.390 mg ivabradine as hydrochloride).
Excipient:
63.91 mg lactose monohydrate For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet.
Salmon-coloured, oblong, film-coated tablet scored on both sides, engraved with “ 5 ” on one face and on the other face.
The tablet can be divided into equal halves.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in patients with normal sinus rhythm, who have a contra-indication or intolerance for beta-blockers.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
For the different doses film-coated tablets containing 5 mg and 7.5 mg ivabradine are available.
The usual recommended starting dose of ivabradine is 5 mg twice daily.
After three to four weeks of treatment, the dose may be increased to 7.5 mg twice daily depending on the therapeutic response.
If, during treatment, heart rate decreases persistently below 50 beats per minute (bpm) at rest or the patient experiences symptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must be titrated downward including the possible dose of 2.5 mg twice daily (one half 5 mg tablet twice daily).
Treatment must be discontinued if heart rate below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist (see section 4.4).
Tablets must be taken orally twice daily, i. e. once in the morning and once in the evening during meals (see section 5.2).
Elderly Since ivabradine has been studied in a limited number of patients aged 75 years or more, a lower starting dose should be considered for these patients (2.5 mg twice daily i. e. one half 5 mg tablet twice daily) before up-titration if necessary.
Renal insufficiency No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal insufficiency and creatinine clearance above 15 ml/ min (see section 5.2).
No data are available in patients with creatinine clearance below 15 ml/ min.
Ivabradine should therefore be used with precaution in this population.
2 Hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment.
Caution should be exercised when using ivabradine in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
Ivabradine is contra-indicated for use in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, since it has not been studied in this population and a large increase in systemic exposure is anticipated (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).
Children and adolescents Corlentor is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1)
- Resting heart rate below 60 beats per minute prior to treatment
- Cardiogenic shock
- Acute myocardial infarction
- Severe hypotension (< 90/ 50 mmHg)
- Severe hepatic insufficiency
- Sick sinus syndrome
- Sino-atrial block
- Heart failure patients with NYHA functional classification III-IV due to a lack of data
- Pacemaker dependent
- Unstable angina
- AV-block of 3rd degree
- Combination with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals
(ketoconazole, itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, josamycin, telithromycin), HIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone (see sections 4.5 and 5.2)
- Pregnancy, lactation (see section 4.6)
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Special warnings
Cardiac arrhythmias Ivabradine is not effective in the treatment or prevention of cardiac arrhythmias and likely loses its efficacy when a tachyarrhythmia occurs (eg. ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia).
Ivabradine is therefore not recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias that interfere with sinus node function.
It is recommended to regularly clinically monitor ivabradine treated patients for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (sustained or paroxysmal), which should also include ECG monitoring if clinically indicated (e. g. in case of exacerbated angina, palpitations, irregular pulse).
Use in patients with AV-block of 2nd degree Ivabradine is not recommended in patients with AV-block of 2nd degree.
Use in patients with a low heart rate Ivabradine must not be initiated in patients with a pre-treatment resting heart rate below 60 beats per minute (see section 4.3).
If, during treatment, resting heart rate decreases persistently below 50 bpm or the patient experiences symptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must be titrated downward or treatment discontinued if heart rate below 50 bpm or symptoms of bradycardia persist (see section 4.2).
3 Combination with other antianginal therapies Concomitant use of ivabradine with heart rate reducing calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem is not recommended (see section 4.5).
No safety issue has been raised on the combination of ivabradine with nitrates and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine.
Additional efficacy of ivabradine in combination with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers has not been established (see section 5.1).
Chronic heart failure Heart failure must be appropriately controlled before considering ivabradine treatment.
The use of ivabradine is contra-indicated in heart failure patients with NYHA functional classification III-IV, due to a lack of data on clinical efficacy and safety (see section 4.3).
Caution is needed in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, as well as in heart failure patients with NYHA functional classification II due to a limited number of patients studied.
Stroke The use of ivabradine is not recommended immediately after a stroke since no data is available in these situations.
Visual function Ivabradine influences on retinal function (see section 5.1).
To date, there is no evidence of a toxic effect of ivabradine on the retina, but the effects of long-term ivabradine treatment beyond one year on retinal function are currently not known.
Cessation of treatment should be considered if any unexpected deterioration in visual function occurs.
Caution should be exercised in patients with retinitis pigmentosa.
Precautions for use
Patients with hypotension Limited data are available in patients with mild to moderate hypotension, and ivabradine should therefore be used with caution in these patients.
Ivabradine is contra-indicated in patients with severe hypotension (blood pressure < 90/ 50 mmHg) (see section 4.3).
Atrial fibrillation - Cardiac arrhythmias There is no evidence of risk of (excessive) bradycardia on return to sinus rhythm when pharmacological cardioversion is initiated in patients treated with ivabradine.
However, in the absence of extensive data, non urgent DC-cardioversion should be considered 24 hours after the last dose of ivabradine.
Use in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal products The use of ivabradine in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal products should be avoided (see section 4.5).
If the combination appears necessary, close cardiac monitoring is needed.
Use in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency Caution should be exercised when using ivabradine in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (see section 4.2).
Use in patients with severe renal insufficiency Caution should be exercised when using ivabradine in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 15 ml/ min) (see section 4.2).
Excipients Since tablets contain lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
4 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Concomitant use not recommended QT prolonging medicinal products
- Cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e. g. quinidine, disopyramide, bepridil, sotalol,
ibutilide, amiodarone).
- Non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e. g. pimozide, ziprasidone, sertindole,
mefloquine, halofantrine, pentamidine, cisapride, erythromycin IV).
The concomitant use of cardiovascular and non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products with ivabradine should be avoided since QT prolongation may be exacerbated by heart rate reduction.
If the combination appears necessary, close cardiac monitoring is needed (see section 4.4).
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Ivabradine is metabolised by CYP3A4 only and it is a very weak inhibitor of this cytochrome.
Ivabradine was shown not to influence the metabolism and plasma concentrations of other CYP3A4 substrates (mild, moderate and strong inhibitors).
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are liable to interact with ivabradine and influence its metabolism and pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent.
Drug-drug interaction studies have established that CYP3A4 inhibitors increase ivabradine plasma concentrations, while inducers decrease them.
Increased plasma concentrations of ivabradine may be associated with the risk of excessive bradycardia (see section 4.4).
Contra-indication of concomitant use The concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, josamycin, telithromycin), HIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).
The potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) and josamycin (1 g twice daily) increased ivabradine mean plasma exposure by 7 to 8 fold.
Concomitant use not recommended Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: specific interaction studies in healthy volunteers and patients have shown that the combination of ivabradine with the heart rate reducing agents diltiazem or verapamil resulted in an increase in ivabradine exposure (2 to 3 fold increase in AUC) and an additional heart rate reduction of 5 bpm.
The concomitant use of ivabradine with these medicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Concomitant use with precautions
- Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: the concomitant use of ivabradine with other moderate CYP3A4
inhibitors (e. g. fluconazole) may be considered at the starting dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and if resting heart rate is above 60 bpm, with monitoring of heart rate.
- Grapefruit juice: ivabradine exposure was increased by 2-fold following the co-administration with
grapefruit juice.
Therefore the intake of grapefruit juice should be restricted during the treatment with ivabradine.
- CYP3A4 inducers:
CYP3A4 inducers (e. g. rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin, Hypericum
perforatum [St John’ s Wort]) may decrease ivabradine exposure and activity.
The concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducing medicinal products may require an adjustment of the dose of ivabradine.
The combination of ivabradine 10 mg twice daily with St John’ s Wort was shown to reduce ivabradine AUC by half.
The intake of St John’ s Wort should be restricted during the treatment with ivabradine.
5 Other concomitant use Specific drug-drug interaction studies have shown no clinically significant effect of the following medicinal products on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ivabradine: proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole), sildenafil, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin), dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, lacidipine), digoxin and warfarin.
In addition there was no clinically significant effect of ivabradine on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, amlodipine, lacidipine, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin and on the pharmacodynamics of aspirin.
In pivotal phase III clinical trials the following medicinal products were not restricted and therefore were routinely combined with ivabradine with no evidence of safety concerns: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, diuretics, short and long acting nitrates, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates, proton pump inhibitors, oral antidiabetics, aspirin and other anti-platelet agents.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data concerning the use of ivabradine in pregnant women.
Animal reproduction studies have shown embryotoxic and teratogenic effects (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Therefore, ivabradine is contra-indicated during pregnancy.
Animal studies indicate that ivabradine is excreted in milk.
Therefore, ivabradine is contra-indicated in breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
A specific study to assess the possible influence of ivabradine on driving performance has been performed in healthy volunteers where no alteration of the driving performance was evidenced.
Ivabradine has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
However, ivabradine may cause transient luminous phenomena consisting mainly of phosphenes (see section 4.8).
The possible occurrence of such luminous phenomena should be taken into account when driving or using machines in situations where sudden variations in light intensity may occur, especially when driving at night.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Corlentor has been studied in clinical trials involving nearly 5,000 participants.
Approximately 2,900 patients have been treated with ivabradine in phase II-III studies.
The most common undesirable effects with ivabradine are dose dependent and related to the pharmacological effect of the medicinal product.
The following adverse effects or events have been reported during clinical trials and are ranked using the following frequency: very common (> 1/ 10); common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1000 ,< 1/100); rare (> 1/ 10000 ,< 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Investigations:
Uncommon:
- Hyperuricaemia
- Eosinophilia
- Elevated creatinine in blood
Cardiac disorders:
Common:
- Bradycardia:
3.3% of patients particularly within the first 2 to 3 months of treatment initiation.
0.5% of patients experienced a severe bradycardia below or equal to 40 bpm.
- AV 1st degree block
- Ventricular extrasystoles
6 Uncommon:
- Palpitations, supraventricular extrasystoles
The following events reported during clinical trials were of similar incidence than comparators and/ or possibly related to the underlying disease: sinus arrhythmia, unstable angina, angina pectoris aggravated, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction and ventricular tachycardia.
Eye disorders:
Very common:
- Luminous phenomena (phosphenes): reported by 14.5% of patients, described as a transient
enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field.
They are usually triggered by sudden variations in light intensity.
The onset of phosphenes is generally within the first two months of treatment after which they may occur repeatedly.
Phosphenes were generally reported to be of mild to moderate intensity.
All phosphenes resolved during or after treatment, of which a majority (77.5%) resolved during treatment.
Fewer than 1% of patients changed their daily routine or discontinued the treatment in relation with phosphenes.
Common:
- Blurred vision
Gastrointestinal disorders:
Uncommon:
- Nausea
- Constipation
- Diarrhoea
General disorders and administration site conditions:
Common:
- Headache, generally during the first month of treatment.
- Dizziness, possibly related to bradycardia.
Uncommon:
- Vertigo
- Dyspnoea
- Muscle cramps
4.9 Overdose
Overdose may lead to severe and prolonged bradycardia (see section 4.8).
Severe bradycardia should be treated symptomatically in a specialised environment.
In the event of bradycardia with poor haemodynamic tolerance, symptomatic treatment including intravenous beta- stimulating agents such as isoprenaline may be considered.
Temporary cardiac electrical pacing may be instituted if required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other cardiac preparations, ATC code:
C01EB17.
Ivabradine is a pure heart rate lowering agent, acting by selective and specific inhibition of the cardiac pacemaker If current that controls the spontaneous diastolic depolarisation in the sinus node and regulates heart rate.
The cardiac effects are specific to the sinus node with no effect on intra-atrial, atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction times, nor on myocardial contractility or ventricular repolarisation.
7 Ivabradine can interact also with the retinal current Ih which closely resembles cardiac If.
It participates in the temporal resolution of the visual system, by curtailing the retinal response to bright light stimuli.
Under triggering circumstances (e. g. rapid changes in luminosity), partial inhibition of Ih by ivabradine underlies the luminous phenomena that may be occasionally experienced by patients.
Luminous phenomena (phosphenes) are described as a transient enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field (see section 4.8).
The main pharmacodynamic property of ivabradine in humans is a specific dose dependent reduction in heart rate.
Analysis of heart rate reduction with doses up to 20 mg twice daily indicates a trend towards a plateau effect which is consistent with a reduced risk of severe bradycardia below 40 bpm (see section 4.8).
At usual recommended doses, heart rate reduction is approximately 10 bpm at rest and during exercise.
This leads to a reduction in cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption.
Ivabradine does not influence intracardiac conduction, contractility (no negative inotropic effect) or ventricular repolarisation:
- in clinical electrophysiology studies, ivabradine had no effect on atrioventricular or intraventricular
conduction times or corrected QT intervals;
- in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 30
and 45%), ivabradine did not have any deleterious influence on LVEF.
The antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of Corlentor was studied in four double-blind randomised trials (two versus placebo, and one each versus atenolol and amlodipine).
These trials included a total of 3,222 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, of whom 2,168 received ivabradine.
Ivabradine 5 mg twice daily was shown to be effective on exercise test parameters within 3 to 4 weeks of treatment.
Efficacy was confirmed with 7.5 mg twice daily.
In particular, the additional benefit over 5 mg twice daily was established in a reference-controlled study versus atenolol: total exercise duration at trough was increased by about 1 minute after one month of treatment with 5 mg twice daily and further improved by almost 25 seconds after an additional 3-month period with forced titration to 7.5 mg twice daily.
In this study, the antianginal and anti-ischaemic benefits of ivabradine were confirmed in patients aged 65 years or more.
The efficacy of 5 and 7.5 mg twice daily was consistent across studies on exercise test parameters (total exercise duration, time to limiting angina, time to angina onset and time to 1mm ST segment depression) and was associated with a decrease of about 70% in the rate of angina attacks.
The twice-daily dosing regimen of ivabradine gave uniform efficacy over 24 hours.
In a 725-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine did not show additional efficacy on top of amlodipine at the trough of drug activity (12 hours after oral intake) while an additional efficacy was shown at peak (3-4 hours after oral intake).
Ivabradine efficacy was fully maintained throughout the 3- or 4-month treatment periods in the efficacy trials.
There was no evidence of pharmacological tolerance (loss of efficacy) developing during treatment nor of rebound phenomena after abrupt treatment discontinuation.
The antianginal and anti-ischaemic effects of ivabradine were associated with dose-dependent reductions in heart rate and with a significant decrease in rate pressure product (heart rate x systolic blood pressure) at rest and during exercise.
The effects on blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance were minor and not clinically significant.
A sustained reduction of heart rate was demonstrated in patients treated with ivabradine for at least one year (n = 713).
No influence on glucose or lipid metabolism was observed.
The antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of ivabradine was preserved in diabetic patients (n = 457) with a similar safety profile as compared to the overall population.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 8 Under physiological conditions, ivabradine is rapidly released from tablets and is highly water-soluble (> 10 mg/ ml).
Ivabradine is the S-enantiomer with no bioconversion demonstrated in vivo.
The N- desmethylated derivative of ivabradine has been identified as the main active metabolite in humans.
Absorption and bioavailability Ivabradine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration with a peak plasma level reached in about 1 hour under fasting condition.
The absolute bioavailability of the film-coated tablets is around 40%, due to first-pass effect in the gut and liver.
Food delayed absorption by approximately 1 hour, and increased plasma exposure by 20 to 30%.
The intake of the tablet during meals is recommended in order to decrease intra-individual variability in exposure (see section 4.2).
Distribution Ivabradine is approximately 70% plasma protein bound and the volume of distribution at steady-state is close to 100 l in patients.
The maximum plasma concentration following chronic administration at the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily is 22 ng/ ml (CV=29%).
The average plasma concentration is 10 ng/ ml (CV=38%) at steady-state.
Biotransformation Ivabradine is extensively metabolised by the liver and the gut by oxidation through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) only.
The major active metabolite is the N-desmethylated derivative (S 18982) with an exposure about 40% of that of the parent compound.
The metabolism of this active metabolite also involves CYP3A4.
Ivabradine has low affinity for CYP3A4, shows no clinically relevant CYP3A4 induction or inhibition and is therefore unlikely to modify CYP3A4 substrate metabolism or plasma concentrations.
Inversely, potent inhibitors and inducers may substantially affect ivabradine plasma concentrations (see section 4.5).
Elimination Ivabradine is eliminated with a main half-life of 2 hours (70-75% of the AUC) in plasma and an effective half-life of 11 hours.
The total clearance is about 400 ml/ min and the renal clearance is about 70 ml/ min.
Excretion of metabolites occurs to a similar extent via faeces and urine.
About 4% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine.
Linearity/ non linearity The kinetics of ivabradine is linear over an oral dose range of 0.5 – 24 mg.
Special populations
- Elderly: no pharmacokinetic differences (AUC and Cmax) have been observed between elderly (≥
65 years) or very elderly patients (≥ 75 years) and the overall population (see section 4.2).
- Renal insufficiency: the impact of renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 15 to 60 ml/ min) on
ivabradine pharmacokinetic is minimal, in relation with the low contribution of renal clearance (about 20%) to total elimination for both ivabradine and its main metabolite S 18982 (see section 4.2).
- Hepatic impairment: in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score up to 7) unbound
AUC of ivabradine and the main active metabolite were about 20% higher than in subjects with normal hepatic function.
Data are insufficient to draw conclusions in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).
Pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/ PD) relationship PK/ PD relationship analysis has shown that heart rate decreases almost linearly with increasing ivabradine and S 18982 plasma concentrations for doses of up to 15-20 mg twice daily.
At higher doses, the decrease in heart rate is no longer proportional to ivabradine plasma concentrations and tends to reach a plateau.
High exposures to ivabradine that may occur when ivabradine is given in
9 combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an excessive decrease in heart rate although this risk is reduced with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Reproductive toxicity studies showed no effect of ivabradine on fertility in male and female rats.
When pregnant animals were treated during organogenesis at exposures close to therapeutic doses, there was a higher incidence of foetuses with cardiac defects in the rat and a small number of foetuses with ectrodactylia in the rabbit.
In dogs given ivabradine (doses of 2, 7 or 24mg/ kg/ day) for one year, reversible changes in retinal function were observed but were not associated with any damage to ocular structures.
These data are consistent with the pharmacological effect of ivabradine related to its interaction with hyperpolarisation-activated Ih currents in the retina, which share extensive homology with the cardiac pacemaker If current.
Other long-term repeat dose and carcinogenicity studies revealed no clinically relevant changes.

The usual recommended starting dose of ivabradine is 5 mg twice daily.
After three to four weeks of treatment, the dose may be increased to 7.5 mg twice daily depending on the therapeutic response.
If, during treatment, heart rate decreases persistently below 50 beats per minute (bpm) at rest or the patient experiences symptoms related to bradycardia such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, the dose must be titrated downward including the possible dose of 2.5 mg twice daily (one half 5 mg tablet twice daily).

Stroke The use of ivabradine is not recommended immediately after a stroke since no data is available in these situations.
Visual function Ivabradine influences on retinal function (see section 5.1).
To date, there is no evidence of a toxic effect of ivabradine on the retina, but the effects of long-term ivabradine treatment beyond one year on retinal function are currently not known.
Cessation of treatment should be considered if any unexpected deterioration in visual function occurs.
Caution should be exercised in patients with retinitis pigmentosa.
Precautions for use
Patients with hypotension Limited data are available in patients with mild to moderate hypotension, and ivabradine should therefore be used with caution in these patients.
Ivabradine is contra-indicated in patients with severe hypotension (blood pressure < 90/ 50 mmHg) (see section 4.3).
Atrial fibrillation - Cardiac arrhythmias There is no evidence of risk of (excessive) bradycardia on return to sinus rhythm when pharmacological cardioversion is initiated in patients treated with ivabradine.
However, in the absence of extensive data, non urgent DC-cardioversion should be considered 24 hours after the last dose of ivabradine.
Use in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal products The use of ivabradine in patients with congenital QT syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal products should be avoided (see section 4.5).
If the combination appears necessary, close cardiac monitoring is needed.
Use in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency Caution should be exercised when using ivabradine in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (see section 4.2).
Use in patients with severe renal insufficiency Caution should be exercised when using ivabradine in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 15 ml/ min) (see section 4.2).
Excipients Since tablets contain lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
14 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Concomitant use not recommended QT prolonging medicinal products
- Cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e. g. quinidine, disopyramide, bepridil, sotalol,
ibutilide, amiodarone).
- Non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products (e. g. pimozide, ziprasidone, sertindole,
mefloquine, halofantrine, pentamidine, cisapride, erythromycin IV).
The concomitant use of cardiovascular and non cardiovascular QT prolonging medicinal products with ivabradine should be avoided since QT prolongation may be exacerbated by heart rate reduction.
If the combination appears necessary, close cardiac monitoring is needed (see section 4.4).
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Ivabradine is metabolised by CYP3A4 only and it is a very weak inhibitor of this cytochrome.
Ivabradine was shown not to influence the metabolism and plasma concentrations of other CYP3A4 substrates (mild, moderate and strong inhibitors).
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are liable to interact with ivabradine and influence its metabolism and pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent.
Drug-drug interaction studies have established that CYP3A4 inhibitors increase ivabradine plasma concentrations, while inducers decrease them.
Increased plasma concentrations of ivabradine may be associated with the risk of excessive bradycardia (see section 4.4).
Contra-indication of concomitant use The concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin per os, josamycin, telithromycin), HIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir) and nefazodone is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).
The potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) and josamycin (1 g twice daily) increased ivabradine mean plasma exposure by 7 to 8 fold.
Concomitant use not recommended Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: specific interaction studies in healthy volunteers and patients have shown that the combination of ivabradine with the heart rate reducing agents diltiazem or verapamil resulted in an increase in ivabradine exposure (2 to 3 fold increase in AUC) and an additional heart rate reduction of 5 bpm.
The concomitant use of ivabradine with these medicinal products is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Concomitant use with precautions
- Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: the concomitant use of ivabradine with other moderate CYP3A4
inhibitors (e. g. fluconazole) may be considered at the starting dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and if resting heart rate is above 60 bpm, with monitoring of heart rate.
- Grapefruit juice: ivabradine exposure was increased by 2-fold following the co-administration with
grapefruit juice.
Therefore the intake of grapefruit juice should be restricted during the treatment with ivabradine.
- CYP3A4 inducers:
CYP3A4 inducers (e. g. rifampicin, barbiturates, phenytoin, Hypericum
perforatum [St John’ s Wort]) may decrease ivabradine exposure and activity.
The concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducing medicinal products may require an adjustment of the dose of ivabradine.
The combination of ivabradine 10 mg twice daily with St John’ s Wort was shown to reduce ivabradine AUC by half.
The intake of St John’ s Wort should be restricted during the treatment with ivabradine.
15 Other concomitant use Specific drug-drug interaction studies have shown no clinically significant effect of the following medicinal products on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ivabradine: proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole), sildenafil, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin), dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, lacidipine), digoxin and warfarin.
In addition there was no clinically significant effect of ivabradine on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, amlodipine, lacidipine, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin and on the pharmacodynamics of aspirin.
In pivotal phase III clinical trials the following medicinal products were not restricted and therefore were routinely combined with ivabradine with no evidence of safety concerns: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, diuretics, short and long acting nitrates, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates, proton pump inhibitors, oral antidiabetics, aspirin and other anti-platelet agents.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data concerning the use of ivabradine in pregnant women.
Animal reproduction studies have shown embryotoxic and teratogenic effects (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Therefore, ivabradine is contra-indicated during pregnancy.
Animal studies indicate that ivabradine is excreted in milk.
Therefore, ivabradine is contra-indicated in breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
A specific study to assess the possible influence of ivabradine on driving performance has been performed in healthy volunteers where no alteration of the driving performance was evidenced.
Ivabradine has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
However, ivabradine may cause transient luminous phenomena consisting mainly of phosphenes (see section 4.8).
The possible occurrence of such luminous phenomena should be taken into account when driving or using machines in situations where sudden variations in light intensity may occur, especially when driving at night.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Corlentor has been studied in clinical trials involving nearly 5,000 participants.
Approximately 2,900 patients have been treated with ivabradine in phase II-III studies.
The most common undesirable effects with ivabradine are dose dependent and related to the pharmacological effect of the medicinal product.
The following adverse effects or events have been reported during clinical trials and are ranked using the following frequency: very common (> 1/ 10); common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10); uncommon (> 1/1000 ,< 1/100); rare (> 1/ 10000 ,< 1/1000); very rare (< 1/10000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Investigations:
Uncommon:
- Hyperuricaemia
- Eosinophilia
- Elevated creatinine in blood
Cardiac disorders:
Common:
- Bradycardia:
3.3% of patients particularly within the first 2 to 3 months of treatment initiation.
0.5% of patients experienced a severe bradycardia below or equal to 40 bpm.
- AV 1st degree block
- Ventricular extrasystoles
16 Uncommon:
- Palpitations, supraventricular extrasystoles
The following events reported during clinical trials were of similar incidence than comparators and/ or possibly related to the underlying disease: sinus arrhythmia, unstable angina, angina pectoris aggravated, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction and ventricular tachycardia.
Eye disorders:
Very common:
- Luminous phenomena (phosphenes): reported by 14.5% of patients, described as a transient
enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field.
They are usually triggered by sudden variations in light intensity.
The onset of phosphenes is generally within the first two months of treatment after which they may occur repeatedly.
Phosphenes were generally reported to be of mild to moderate intensity.
All phosphenes resolved during or after treatment, of which a majority (77.5%) resolved during treatment.
Fewer than 1% of patients changed their daily routine or discontinued the treatment in relation with phosphenes.
Common:
- Blurred vision
Gastrointestinal disorders:
Uncommon:
- Nausea
- Constipation
- Diarrhoea
General disorders and administration site conditions:
Common:
- Headache, generally during the first month of treatment.
- Dizziness, possibly related to bradycardia.
Uncommon:
- Vertigo
- Dyspnoea
- Muscle cramps
4.9 Overdose
Overdose may lead to severe and prolonged bradycardia (see section 4.8).
Severe bradycardia should be treated symptomatically in a specialised environment.
In the event of bradycardia with poor haemodynamic tolerance, symptomatic treatment including intravenous beta- stimulating agents such as isoprenaline may be considered.
Temporary cardiac electrical pacing may be instituted if required.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: other cardiac preparations, ATC code:
C01EB17.
Ivabradine is a pure heart rate lowering agent, acting by selective and specific inhibition of the cardiac pacemaker If current that controls the spontaneous diastolic depolarisation in the sinus node and regulates heart rate.
The cardiac effects are specific to the sinus node with no effect on intra-atrial, atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction times, nor on myocardial contractility or ventricular repolarisation.
17 Ivabradine can interact also with the retinal current Ih which closely resembles cardiac If.
It participates in the temporal resolution of the visual system, by curtailing the retinal response to bright light stimuli.
Under triggering circumstances (e. g. rapid changes in luminosity), partial inhibition of Ih by ivabradine underlies the luminous phenomena that may be occasionally experienced by patients.
Luminous phenomena (phosphenes) are described as a transient enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field (see section 4.8).
The main pharmacodynamic property of ivabradine in humans is a specific dose dependent reduction in heart rate.
Analysis of heart rate reduction with doses up to 20 mg twice daily indicates a trend towards a plateau effect which is consistent with a reduced risk of severe bradycardia below 40 bpm (see section 4.8).
At usual recommended doses, heart rate reduction is approximately 10 bpm at rest and during exercise.
This leads to a reduction in cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen consumption.
Ivabradine does not influence intracardiac conduction, contractility (no negative inotropic effect) or ventricular repolarisation:
- in clinical electrophysiology studies, ivabradine had no effect on atrioventricular or intraventricular
conduction times or corrected QT intervals;
- in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between 30
and 45%), ivabradine did not have any deleterious influence on LVEF.
The antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of Corlentor was studied in four double-blind randomised trials (two versus placebo, and one each versus atenolol and amlodipine).
These trials included a total of 3,222 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, of whom 2,168 received ivabradine.
Ivabradine 5 mg twice daily was shown to be effective on exercise test parameters within 3 to 4 weeks of treatment.
Efficacy was confirmed with 7.5 mg twice daily.
In particular, the additional benefit over 5 mg twice daily was established in a reference-controlled study versus atenolol: total exercise duration at trough was increased by about 1 minute after one month of treatment with 5 mg twice daily and further improved by almost 25 seconds after an additional 3-month period with forced titration to 7.5 mg twice daily.
In this study, the antianginal and anti-ischaemic benefits of ivabradine were confirmed in patients aged 65 years or more.
The efficacy of 5 and 7.5 mg twice daily was consistent across studies on exercise test parameters (total exercise duration, time to limiting angina, time to angina onset and time to 1mm ST segment depression) and was associated with a decrease of about 70% in the rate of angina attacks.
The twice-daily dosing regimen of ivabradine gave uniform efficacy over 24 hours.
In a 725-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, ivabradine did not show additional efficacy on top of amlodipine at the trough of drug activity (12 hours after oral intake) while an additional efficacy was shown at peak (3-4 hours after oral intake).
Ivabradine efficacy was fully maintained throughout the 3- or 4-month treatment periods in the efficacy trials.
There was no evidence of pharmacological tolerance (loss of efficacy) developing during treatment nor of rebound phenomena after abrupt treatment discontinuation.
The antianginal and anti-ischaemic effects of ivabradine were associated with dose-dependent reductions in heart rate and with a significant decrease in rate pressure product (heart rate x systolic blood pressure) at rest and during exercise.
The effects on blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance were minor and not clinically significant.
A sustained reduction of heart rate was demonstrated in patients treated with ivabradine for at least one year (n = 713).
No influence on glucose or lipid metabolism was observed.
The antianginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of ivabradine was preserved in diabetic patients (n = 457) with a similar safety profile as compared to the overall population.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 18 Under physiological conditions, ivabradine is rapidly released from tablets and is highly water-soluble (> 10 mg/ ml).
Ivabradine is the S-enantiomer with no bioconversion demonstrated in vivo.
The N- desmethylated derivative of ivabradine has been identified as the main active metabolite in humans.
Absorption and bioavailability Ivabradine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration with a peak plasma level reached in about 1 hour under fasting condition.
The absolute bioavailability of the film-coated tablets is around 40%, due to first-pass effect in the gut and liver.
Food delayed absorption by approximately 1 hour, and increased plasma exposure by 20 to 30%.
The intake of the tablet during meals is recommended in order to decrease intra-individual variability in exposure (see section 4.2).
Distribution Ivabradine is approximately 70% plasma protein bound and the volume of distribution at steady-state is close to 100 l in patients.
The maximum plasma concentration following chronic administration at the recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily is 22 ng/ ml (CV=29%).
The average plasma concentration is 10 ng/ ml (CV=38%) at steady-state.
Biotransformation Ivabradine is extensively metabolised by the liver and the gut by oxidation through cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) only.
The major active metabolite is the N-desmethylated derivative (S 18982) with an exposure about 40% of that of the parent compound.
The metabolism of this active metabolite also involves CYP3A4.
Ivabradine has low affinity for CYP3A4, shows no clinically relevant CYP3A4 induction or inhibition and is therefore unlikely to modify CYP3A4 substrate metabolism or plasma concentrations.
Inversely, potent inhibitors and inducers may substantially affect ivabradine plasma concentrations (see section 4.5).
Elimination Ivabradine is eliminated with a main half-life of 2 hours (70-75% of the AUC) in plasma and an effective half-life of 11 hours.
The total clearance is about 400 ml/ min and the renal clearance is about 70 ml/ min.
Excretion of metabolites occurs to a similar extent via faeces and urine.
About 4% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in urine.
Linearity/ non linearity The kinetics of ivabradine is linear over an oral dose range of 0.5 – 24 mg.
Special populations
- Elderly: no pharmacokinetic differences (AUC and Cmax) have been observed between elderly (≥
65 years) or very elderly patients (≥ 75 years) and the overall population (see section 4.2).
- Renal insufficiency: the impact of renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 15 to 60 ml/ min) on
ivabradine pharmacokinetic is minimal, in relation with the low contribution of renal clearance (about 20%) to total elimination for both ivabradine and its main metabolite S 18982 (see section 4.2).
- Hepatic impairment: in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score up to 7) unbound
AUC of ivabradine and the main active metabolite were about 20% higher than in subjects with normal hepatic function.
Data are insufficient to draw conclusions in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).
Pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/ PD) relationship PK/ PD relationship analysis has shown that heart rate decreases almost linearly with increasing ivabradine and S 18982 plasma concentrations for doses of up to 15-20 mg twice daily.
At higher doses, the decrease in heart rate is no longer proportional to ivabradine plasma concentrations and tends to reach a plateau.
High exposures to ivabradine that may occur when ivabradine is given in
19 combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in an excessive decrease in heart rate although this risk is reduced with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Reproductive toxicity studies showed no effect of ivabradine on fertility in male and female rats.
When pregnant animals were treated during organogenesis at exposures close to therapeutic doses, there was a higher incidence of foetuses with cardiac defects in the rat and a small number of foetuses with ectrodactylia in the rabbit.
In dogs given ivabradine (doses of 2, 7 or 24mg/ kg/ day) for one year, reversible changes in retinal function were observed but were not associated with any damage to ocular structures.
These data are consistent with the pharmacological effect of ivabradine related to its interaction with hyperpolarisation-activated Ih currents in the retina, which share extensive homology with the cardiac pacemaker If current.
Other long-term repeat dose and carcinogenicity studies revealed no clinically relevant changes.

1.
WHAT CORLENTOR IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Corlentor is a heart medicine used to treat stable angina pectoris which causes chest pain, when beta- blockers (like atenolol, propranolol, metoprolol, etc, for high blood pressure, heart rhythm disorders, or angina pectoris) are not suitable.
About stable angina pectoris (usually referred to as “ angina”):
Stable angina is a heart disease which happens when the heart does not receive enough oxygen.
It usually appears between 40 and 50 years of age.
The most common symptom of angina is chest pain or discomfort.
Angina is more likely to happen when the heart beats faster in situations such as exercise, emotion, exposure to the cold or after eating.
This increase in heart rate can cause the chest pain in people who suffer from angina.
How does Corlentor work?
Corlentor mainly works by reducing the heart rate by a few beats per minute.
This lowers the heart’ s need for oxygen especially in the situations when an angina attack is more likely to happen.
In this way Corlentor helps to control and reduce the number of angina attacks.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE CORLENTOR
Do not take Corlentor:
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to ivabradine or any of the other ingredients of Corlentor;
- if your resting heart rate before treatment is too slow (below 60 beats per minute);
- if you are suffering from cardiogenic shock (a heart condition treated in hospital);
- if you suffer from a heart rhythm disorder;
- if you are having a heart attack;
- if you suffer from very low blood pressure;
- if you suffer from unstable angina (a severe form in which chest pain occurs very frequently and
with or without exertion);
- if you suffer from severe heart failure (when your heart fails to work properly);
- if you have a pacemaker;
- if you suffer from severe liver problems;
- if you are already taking medicines for the treatment of fungal infections (such as ketoconazole,
itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (such as josamycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin or
33 erythromycin given orally), medicines to treat HIV infections (such as nelfinavir, ritonavir) or nefazodone (medicine to treat depression) (see “ Taking other medicines”);
- if you are pregnant;
- if you are breast-feeding.
Take special care with Corlentor:
- if you suffer from a heart rhythm disorder,
- if you have symptoms such as tiredness or shortness of breath (this could mean that your heart is
slowing down too much),
- if you are already taking diltiazem, verapamil,
- if you are taking QT prolonging medicines to treat either heart rhythm disorders or other
conditions (see the products listed in “ Taking other medicines”),
- if you suffer from sustained atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat),
- if you have had a recent stroke (cerebral attack),
- if you suffer from mild to moderate low blood pressure,
- if you suffer from chronic heart failure (when your heart fails to work properly),
- if you suffer from chronic retinal disease,
- if you suffer from moderate liver problems,
- if you suffer from severe renal problems.
If any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor before or while taking Corlentor.
Taking other medicines:
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Make sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines, as a dose adjustment of Corlentor or monitoring should be required:
- diltiazem, verapamil (for high blood pressure or angina pectoris)
- fluconazole (an antifungal agent)
- rifampicin (an antibiotic)
- barbiturates (for difficult sleeping or epilepsy)
- phenytoin (for epilepsy)
- Hypericum perforatum or St John’ s Wort (herbal treatment for depression)
- QT prolonging medicines to treat either heart rhythm disorders or other conditions such as:
- quinidine, disopyramide, ibutilide, sotalol, amiodarone (to treat heart rhythm disorders)
- bepridil (to treat angina pectoris)
