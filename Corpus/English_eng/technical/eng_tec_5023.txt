(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Attempts to set the access and modification time of the file named by filename to the value given by time.
If the option time is not given, uses the present time.
This is equivalent to what utime (sometimes referred to as utimes) does.
If the third option atime is present, the access time of the given filename is set to the value of atime.
Note that the access time is always modified, regardless of the number of parameters.
If the file does not exist, it is created.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
Example 1. touch() example
if (touch ($FileName)) {print "$FileName modification time has been changed to todays date and time";} else {print "Sorry Could Not change modification time of $FileName";}
