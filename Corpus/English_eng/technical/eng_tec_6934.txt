& kde; Extragear Applications
These are applications that are directly associated with & kde;, the project, but do not appear and are not shipped with the main & kde; distribution. This can be down to a number of reasons, but a common case is either down to a duplication of functionality, or because they're simply too specialised. Perhaps the most popular occurence however is that the developers themselves may not want it to appear in the main & kde; distribution; choosing, rather, to handle their own release schedules. Nevertheless, the applications in Extragear are distinguished by & kde;, and many are increasingly popular.
Available in the & kde; Extragear
Multimedia
& amarok;
An advanced and comprehensive music player with the capability to play MP3, WAV, and OGG audio filetypes and others. There is not room here to mention all of & amarok; 's features, but by default, & amarok; can automatically fetch cover art, embed song lyrics, and display aesthetically pleasing visualizations. & amarok; remains, as much of & kde; does, highly customizable; it contains a powerful scripting interface, and the context browser can be stylised easily using & CSS;. & amarok; also supports several backends, including GStreamer, xine, NMM, MAS, aKode and & arts;.
Website: http: / /amarok. kde. org
View the handbook by typing help: / amarok in & konqueror; 's Location Toolbar, or by selecting it in & khelpcenter;; if you do not already have & amarok; installed (and hence do not have the handbook), then you can view it online here.
K3b
The definitive & CD; / DVD burning application for & kde;. With K3b you can create data, video, and audio (it comes with plugins for WAV, MP3, FLAC, and Ogg Vorbis) & CD; s. Projects can be saved and loaded, & CD; -ripping is supported, and you can appropriately make & CD; / DVD copies.

Graphics
& digikam;
A photo management application which can conveniently organize and import digital photos. Features include complete tagging functionality, a plugin system, and a fully-featured comment system. & digikam; also makes use of KIPI (kde; Image Plugin Interface), therefore contributing to the initiative to create a common plugin infrastructure, which allows development of image plugins that can be shared among graphical applications in & kde; (others include Gwenview, ShowImg and KimDaBa).

Gwenview
Another advanced image viewer which can load and save all image formats supported by & kde;, as well as being able to display the GIMP (*. xcf) image filetype.
