I'd like to see this played up a bit more.
The People Nearby service is a serverless communication service: you do not need to connect and authenticate to a central server in order to use it.

The people that use this service inside the same local area network will be auto-discovered, and it will be possible to send them messages and files as with other services.

Geolocation Privacy
What information is sent
What is possible to send is: your country, region, locality, area, street, building, floor, room, and postal code, longitude, latitude and altitude, speed and bearing.
The accuracy and the quantity of information about your geographical position are based on the software or on the infrastructure used to discover your position.
Different kind of networks may have different accuracy settings, and may send different information. The use of external devices such as GPS or mobile phone will increase the accuracy of the information sent.
When the privacy mode is enabled, nothing more precise than your city will be sent, even if you are using an external device.
