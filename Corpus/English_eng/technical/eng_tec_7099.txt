Clock rotation
Every hour rotates 360 degrees.
Brothers and sisters
Out of [people] people, [brothers] have brothers, [sisters] have sisters and [both] have both. How many people have neither brothers nor sisters?
It is calculated by taking the total number of people minus [brothers_only] people that have brothers only, minus [sisters_only] that have sisters only and minus [both] that have sisters and brothers.
Age
John's son age is nowadays half of John's age minus [difference], that is, ([father] / 2) - [difference].
Password
Every digit has 10 possibilities. The total number of possibilities is 10 at the power of [digits].
Every digit has 8 possibilities. The total number of possibilities is 8 at the power of [digits].
Tennis game
Every game is an independent event with 2 possible results. The total number of possibilities is 2 at the power of [games].
In every match you eliminate one player. Therefore, the result is the total number of player minus one.
Bank interest
Compound interest is paid on the principal plus any past interest accumulated.
Simple equations
What number plus [num_a] equals [num_b]?
x + [num_a] = [num_b]
It is the result of the operation [num_b] - [num_a].
What number minus [num_a] equals [num_b]?
x - [num_a] = [num_b]
It is the result of the operation [num_a] + [num_b].
What number multiplied by [num_a] equals [num_b]?
x * [num_a] = [num_b]
It is the result of the operation [num_b] / [num_a].
What number divided by [num_a] equals [num_b]?
x / [num_a] = [num_b]
It is the result of the operation [num_a] * [num_b].
Boxes
Container
Box
How many boxes measuring 1 x 1 x 0.5 can be fit into a container measuring 6 x 5 x [z]?
You can fit 6 * 5 * [z] * 2 boxes.
Palindromic years
[year_start] is a palindromic year as [year_end] is, a gap of 11 years. What are the next two consecutive palindromic years after [year_end] with the same gap? Answer using two numbers (e.g.: [year_start] and [year_end]).
A palindromic number remains the same when its digits are reversed (e.g.: 2112).
[rslt_a] and [rslt_b]
From year 1000 to year 10000, palindrome years occur at 110 year intervals except for the end of each millennium that occur at a 11 years interval.
Dartboard
On the dartboard below, where would you need to throw the darts to add 120 points in 5 throws? Answer using a list of numbers (e.g.: 4, 5, 6, 3, 2)
Only 3 of the 4 numbers in the dartboard are used to add 120 points.
Horse race
Every person has two legs and every horse four (2 * [men] + [horses] * 4). Every person and every horse have also two eyes (2 * [men] + 2 * [horses]).
Lever
How much weight is needed at the point indicated by the question mark to balance the lever?
Consider the sentence attributed to Archimedes: 'Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand and I can move the Earth'.
A lever is in equilibrium when the objects placed on it are at a distances reciprocally proportional to their weights.
Multiple number
Which two numbers of the list below are both multiple of [num_x] and [num_y]? [option_answers]
A multiple is a number that may be divided by another number with no remainder. For example, 10, 15 and 25 are multiples of 5.
Choose one of the following:
[option_prefix] [option_a] and [option_c]
[option_prefix] [option_a] and [option_b]
[option_prefix] [option_b] and [option_c]
[option_prefix] [option_c] and [option_d]
[option_a] and [option_b]
[option_a] and [option_b] are both multiples of [num_x] and [num_y].
Cars in town
In a small town, [all_cars]% of the inhabitants have a car and [males_cars]% have a car and are males. What percentage of the population are females and have a car? [option_answers]
[option_prefix] [option_a]%
[option_prefix] [option_b]%
[option_prefix] [option_c]%
[option_prefix] [option_d]%
[females_cars]% ([all_cars] - [males_cars]) of the inhabitants are women and have a car.
Compare variables
If p &lt; x &lt; q and r &lt; y &lt; s and you know that x &lt; y is true, which of the following options is correct? [option_answers]
[option_prefix] s > p
[option_prefix] p < r
[option_prefix] p > r
[option_prefix] q = s
If x &lt; y, then p &lt; x &lt; y &lt; s so s &gt; p is true.
If p &lt; x &lt; q and r &lt; y &lt; s and you know that x &gt; y is true, which of the following options is correct? [option_answers]
[option_prefix] r < q
If x &gt; y, then r &lt; y &lt; x &lt; q, so r &lt; q is true.
Odd number
Given two integer numbers x and y, if x is even and y odd, which of the following expressions gives always an odd result? [option_answers]
[option_prefix] 2x + y
[option_prefix] x * y
[option_prefix] x * y * 2
[option_prefix] (x - y) * 2
Multiplication of two even numbers always produces an even number, so x multiplied by 2 is even. Adding an odd number (y) to that even number always produces an odd number.
