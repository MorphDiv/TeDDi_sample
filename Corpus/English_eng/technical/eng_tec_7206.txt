Introduction

The most common image formats are JPEG and GIF. The JPEG format is good for medium and big sized images because it has a high compression rate keeping a good image quality. The GIF format is used in Web pages for displaying little animations or little static images. Another important image format is PNG, this format is very common on Unix platforms and is considered a replacement of the GIF format.

To Rotate Images Without Loss of Quality
Usually if you want to rotate an image you have to open the image with an editor, rotate the image, and then save it. This works well for image formats such as PNG or GIF, but results in a loss of quality for JPEG images. (The rotation functions in

If you check the
In general, there are two ways to rotate a JPEG image. The first way is to re-arrange the pixels inside the image file, using a "physical" transform. The second way is to leave the image data alone, and simply change the value of the Exif orientation tag inside the header of the JPEG file. Not all JPEG files have Exif tags however, and not all applications support them. If your image does not have Exif tags, the pixels will be re-arranged inside the image file automatically, since that is the only possible method.
If your image has an Exif orientation tag, and the
For maximum compatibility with other applications, it is recommended that the
If your image has an Exif orientation tag, and the
The physical transform of pixel data inside the JPEG file will not degrade image quality (that is, it is lossless) under most conditions. However, if the image dimensions (height and width) are not both multiples of 8, some data corruption will occur along one or two of the edges of the image. If there is an Exif orientation tag, you can avoid this problem by disabling the

#
This symbol will be replaced with the value of a counter that increments itself by 1 passing from one image to another. If you specify this symbols in sequence you'll get leading zeros if the counter value has a lesser number of digits, for example ### will produce the sequence: 001, 002, 003, etc..
%f
This symbol will be replaced with the image original name, excluding the extension.
%e
This symbol will be replaced with the image original filename extension.
%d

Scripts with the %F code will be executed just once, regardless of the number of files selected. All other scripts will be executed once per selected file.
Several default scripts are provided. These can be replaced by the user, if desired. The default scripts are explained below:
gimp %F &
This script tells the GNU Image Manipulation Program (gimp) to open all of the select files. This is most efficient if we include all of the filenames on one line, rather than calling
convert %f -font Helvetica -pointsize 20 -fill white -box '#00000080' -gravity South -annotate +0+5 ' Copyright 2007, Your Name Here ' %n-copyright%e
This script makes a copy of your image file, and adds a copyright notice to it. The "convert" command is part of the ImageMagick package. If the original file is named sample.jpg, the new file will be named sample-copyright.jpg.
mkdir -p %p/approved ; cp %f %p/approved/
This script creates a new sub-folder called "approved", if it does not exist already. It then copies the select files to the "approved" sub-folder.
uuencode %f %f | mail -s Photos your@emailaddress.com
This script encodes images files in a format suitable for email attachments, and then emails each photo to the specified address. One email per photo is sent.
rm ~/myarchive.zip; zip -j ~/myarchive %F
This script overwrites an existing zip file, if present, with a new zip file containing the selected images.
rm ~/myarchive.zip; zip -j ~/myarchive %F; uuencode ~/myarchive.zip ~/myarchive.zip | mail -s Photos your@emailaddress.com
This combines the previous two scripts, so that the selected images are combined into a single zip file, which is then emailed.
