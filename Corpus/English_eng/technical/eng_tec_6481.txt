Introduction
& kmobiletools; is a program that lets you manage mobile phones.
It handles full SMS control, dialing calls, phonebook, and phone status monitoring. It's also integrated with the & kde; environment, so it can be embeded in & kontact;, or import/ export from and to & kaddressbook;.
& kmobiletools; is completely modular: the main program can load so called "Engines" which can support different range of devices. Each engine also has a set of wizard pages, so that the user is guided in adding new devices.
AT Engine has been tested on Motorola, Nokia, Siemens, Sony Ericsson and LG mobile phones. Anyway each AT Command compliant device should be well supported. It allows the user to upload and download the phonebook, view SMS stored on the phone, and write new ones. It also can dial numbers and display phone parameters.
Gammu Engine uses Gammu as backend to connect to the mobile phone, and so the list of supported phones can be found in the project homepage (or). It has almost the same features than the AT Engine, and even something more, but it is younger and less tested. It also supports a smaller list of mobile phones.
& kmobiletools; homepage can be found on. There you will find user documentation, a support forum and contact information.
Getting Started
This chapter is just a short introduction to & kmobiletools; as well as its usage so you can start using it right away. More information on using & kmobiletools; can be found in the Using & kmobiletools; section.
When starting & kmobiletools; for the first time, you will see the welcome homepage.
Here's a screenshot of & kmobiletools; main window
Wizard
Clicking on the Add new mobile phone device link will launch a wizard that will help you in configuring & kmobiletools; to use your mobile phone.
Here's a screenshot of & kmobiletools; new device wizard
The Mobile Phone Name entry will allow you to choose a friendly name to be displayed in & kmobiletools; for your phone. The field below instead is used to choose the engine that will manage your mobile phone. The next wizard pages will be different for each engine.
Using & kmobiletools;
This Chapter will show you & kmobiletools; usage in the most common tasks.
& kmobiletools; Main Window
The main window will show you a list of configured phones. It will display also their current status:
Not Loaded: the engine relative to this mobile phone is not loaded.
Not Connected: the engine is loaded, but the phone is not found.
Connected: the engine is loaded, and the phone was found as manageable.
Mobile Phone HomePage
The Mobile Phone Homepage will show you some useful information about your mobile phone, like the number of messages, contacts, and a brief summary of the calendar. In the status bar you will also see your network operator (when supported), and the level of battery and network signal, plus a visual representation of currently executing tasks.
Clicking on the Phone details link will also show you more advanced information, like phone manufacturer and model or the IMEI code.

Phonebook Management
& kmobiletools; Phonebook Management page contains a list of entries and a html-like page showing details. While the Phone Contacts tab will show you contacts from the current mobile phone, the Other Contacts tab contains items from other devices, and & kaddressbook;.
Clicking an entry will automatically update the details page. In the details page, at the bottom row there will be a list of tasks to handle contacts, creating new items, removing and modifying current ones. You can also right click a contact in the list, and selecting multiple items will work too, when appropriate.

Adding new contacts is easy! You just need to click the Add new link, then choose the name to assign to this contact in the new dialog window appearing. Remember also to add phone numbers entering it in the Phone numbers text box and clicking the Add button after having selected the proper number type in the combo box above that button. You can also choose where you want to save the new contact.
Short Text Messages Management
The SMS Page is similar to a mail application like & kmail;. The left list shows the count of messages and their position, while the right one shows the sender number (or the name, if it is found in the phonebook), the date of the message and the subject. Finally, the page at down will show the message text, plus some actions allowing you to remove messages, or write a new one.
Here's a screenshot of & kmobiletools; sms list page
Clicking the Write New link will pop up a simple dialog window that will guide you in writing a new SMS Message. Just remember to add a recipient first, by both writing the number in the text box or picking it from the phonebook clicking the Browse button, and then the Add button. You will now need to write the message itself in the box below, and then clicking one of the Send or Store buttons.
