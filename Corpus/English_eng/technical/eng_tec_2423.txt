If the optional length argument is given, writing will stop after length (uncompressed) bytes have been written or the end of string is reached, whichever comes first.
Example 1. bzwrite() Example
?php $str = "uncompressed data"; $bz = bzopen(" / tmp / foo.bz2", "w"); bzwrite($bz, $str, strlen($str)); bzclose($bz);?
