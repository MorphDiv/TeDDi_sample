Comment (optional):
Custom Decryption Command: This option allows the user to specify a custom command to be executed by GPG when decryption occurs. (This is recommended for advanced users only).
Custom decryption command:
PGP 6 compatibility
PGP 6 compatibility: Checking this option forces GnuPG to output encrypted packets that are as compliant with PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) 6 standards as possible thus allowing GnuPG users to inter operate with PGP 6 users.
ASCII armored encryption
ASCII armored encryption: Checking this option outputs all encrypted files in a format that can be opened by a text editor and as such the output is suitable for placing in the body of an e-mail message.
Use *. pgp extension for encrypted files
Use *. pgp extension for encrypted files: Checking this option will append a. pgp extension to all encrypted files instead of a. gpg extension. This option will maintain compatibility with users of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software.
Hide user id
Hide user ID: Checking this option will remove the keyid of the recipient from all encrypted packets. The advantage: traffic analysis of the encrypted packets cannot be performed as easily because the recipient is unknown. The disadvantage: the receiver of the encrypted packets is forced to try all secret keys before being able to decrypt the packets. This can be a lengthy process depending on the number of secret keys the receiver holds.
Custom encryption command:
Custom encryption command: When activated, an entry field will be shown in the key selection dialog, enabling you to enter a custom command for encryption. This option is recommended for experienced users only.
Always encrypt with:
Always encrypt with: This ensures all files/ messages will also be encrypted with the chosen key. However, if the "Encrypt files with:" option is selected that chosen key will override the "Always encrypt with:" selection.
Encrypt files with:
Encrypt files with: Checking this option and selecting a key will force any file encryption operation to use the selected key. KGpg will not query for a recipient and the default key will be bypassed.
Allow encryption with untrusted keys
Allow encryption with untrusted keys: When importing a public key, the key is usually marked as untrusted and as such cannot be used unless it is signed by the default key (thus making it'trusted '). Checking this box enables any key to be used even if it is untrusted.
Global Settings:

Home location:
Home Location This is the directory where GnuPG stores its configuration and the keyrings. If you have not changed it this is usually ~/. gnupg/
Configuration file:
Configuration File This is the name of the configuration file in the directory specified above. The default is gnupg. conf while older versions of GnuPG used options.
Change...
Program path:
Program path This is the program that will be called for all GnuPG operations. The default of gpg will work on most systems.
Use GnuPG agent
Use GnuPG agent The GnuPG agent stores the passwords for your secret keys in memory for a limited amount of time. If you use your secret key again while it is cached you do not have to enter it again. This is less secure than typing it every time.
Global Settings
Start KGpg automatically at KDE startup: If checked KGpg will start automatically each time that KDE starts up.
Start KGpg automatically at login
Use mouse selection instead of clipboard: If checked, clipboard operations in KGpg will use the selection clipboard, that means highlighting a text to copy, and middle button (or right+left together) to paste. If this option is not checked, the clipboard will work with Key shortcuts (Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v).
Use mouse selection instead of clipboard

Key Server: A Key Server is a centralized repository of PGP/ GnuPG keys connected to the Internet which can be conveniently accessed in order to obtain or deposit keys. Select from the drop down list to specify which key server should be used. Often these keys are held by people whom the user has never met and as such the authenticity is dubious at best. Refer to the GnuPG manual covering "Web-of-Trust" relationships to find out how GnuPG works around the problem of verifying authenticity.
Key Server Drop Down Dialog: Allows the user to select the Key Server which will be used to import PGP/ GnuPG keys into the local keyring.
Text to search or ID of the key to import: There are multiple ways to search for a key, you can use a text or partial text search (example: entering Phil or Zimmerman will bring up all keys in which Phil or Zimmerman shows up) or you can search by the ID's of the key. Key ID's are strings of letters and numbers that uniquely identify a key (example: searching for 0xED7585F4 would bring up the key associated with that ID).

If you want to decrypt a text file, simply drag and drop it into the editor window. KGpg will do the rest. Even remote files can be dropped. Drag a public key into the editor window and kgpg will automatically import it if you want.
The easiest way to encrypt a file: simply right click on the file, and you have an encrypt option in the contextual menu. This works in konqueror or on your Desktop!
If you want to encrypt a message for several persons, just select several encryption keys by pressing the & quot; Ctrlquot; key.
You do not know anything about encryption? No problem, simply create yourself a key pair in the key management window. Then, export your public key and mail it to your friends. Ask them to do the same and import their public keys. Finally, to send an encrypted message, type it in the KGpg editor, then click & quot; encryptquot;. Choose your friend key and click & quot; encryptquot; again. The message will be encrypted, ready to be sent by email.
To perform an operation on a key, open the key management window and right click on the key. A popup menu with all available options will appear.
Decrypt a file with a single mouse click on it. You will then be prompted for password, and then that is it!
If you only want to open the key manager, type this in the command line prompt: kgpg -k The editor can be reached by: kgpg -d
To open a file in the KGpg's editor and immediately decrypt it type: kgpg -s filename
If you want to change the password or expiration of a secret key simply double click on it to get the key properties dialog.
You can reach your default key by pressing & quot; Ctrl+Homequot; in the key manager.
The number of signatures is shown as a tooltip if you hover the mouse on the size column in key manager. A key has to be expanded once for this to work.
