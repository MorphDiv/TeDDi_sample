Payees
The Payees screen provides detailed information about all the payees and payers involved in transactions. The Payees screen is split into two main areas: a payees and payers list and a detail area.
The Payees screen allows for viewing the transactions for the selected payee, updating personal information associated with a particular payee or payer, and specifying transaction matching criteria.
Payees List
A list of payees and payers is on the left side of this screen. The payee list is sorted alphabetically. To sort in reverse alphabetical order, click on the Name title at the top of the list.
Adding a Payee or Payer
To add a payee or payer, right-click on any payee name and choose New payee. This creates a new payee called New Payee. Right-click on this payee and select Rename payee to enter the name of the new payee or payer.
Renaming a Payee or Payer
To rename a payee or payer, simply right-click on the name, select Rename payee and the name becomes editable. Changing the name will affect the name in all the transactions in which it appears.
Deleting a Payee or Payer
To remove a payee or payer, right-click the name and select Delete payee. If the payee has any transactions, you will be presented with a dialog that allows you to reassign them to a different payee, and also a check box to enable a deleted name to be added to the new payee's matching list.
Additional Payee Details
Personal Information
To view and edit the personal information associated with a particular payee, select the payee from the list and select the Address tab. To modify this information, edit the detail area directly and press the Update button when finished.

Transaction Matching Settings
Overview
& kappname; has the ability to automatically assign the proper payee to imported transactions. This can be handy when importing transactions from your bank, when the payee name has extra unnecessary characters, or worse, if the payee names change.
For example, let's say your monthly mortgage payment comes in from your bank like this SUNTRUST BANK MAPLE VALLEY, GA 111506 one month and then SUNTRUST BANK MAPLE VALLEY, GA 121606 the next month. You would really like both of those transactions to be assigned simply to your payee SunTrust. The transaction matching feature is for you!

Setting up
From the Matching tab, you can set the Transaction Matching Settings. You have 3 major options:
No Matching. Disables the feature for this payee. This is the default setting for all payees.
Match on Payee Name. Enables the feature, and uses the payee name itself as the Match Key
Match on Key. Enables the feature, and allows you to enter one or more Match Keys of your choosing. In general, entering a plain string will work perfectly. However, the match keys are actually regular expressions, so it is possible to match on more complicated patterns.
You can also choose whether you want to ignore the case of the Match Key. If you choose this option, the Match Key SunTrust would match SUNTRUST BANK or SunTrust Bank.
Importing Transactions
When you import transactions using the QIF import, or using a plugin such as OFX or AqBanking, the Match Keys you have set will be considered. If the Match Key for one of your payees is found anywhere in the payee of the imported transaction, the corresponding payee from your list will be assigned to that transaction. Thus, a Match Key of SunTrust will match SUNTRUST BANK MAPLE VALLEY, GA or even MORGENSUNTRUSTamp; LOAN. So choose your Match Keys carefully.
If a transaction payee matches more than one Match Key, the behaviour is undefined. & kappname; will arbitrarily pick one of the matching payees.
Viewing Transaction History
To view all transactions associated with a particular payee, select the payee from the list and the Transaction tab in the detail area. Double-clicking a particular transaction will bring you directly to that transaction in the Ledgers screen.
