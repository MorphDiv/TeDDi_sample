File I/O Functions
Use File I/O functions to create and manage user-defined (data) files.
You can use these functions to support the creation of &quot; relative &quot; files, so that you can save and reload certain records by specifying their record number.
File I/O functions can also help you manage your files by providing you with information such as file size, current path settings, or the creation date of a file or a directory.
