Printing a Brochure
You can print a Writer document as a brochure or a booklet.
That is, Writer prints two pages on each side of the paper, so that when you fold the paper, you can read the document as a book.
When you create a document that you want to print as a brochure, use portrait orientation for the pages.
Writer applies the brochure layout when you print the document.
