Do not use concomitantly with corticosteroids or other NSAIDs.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
The recommended dose, as indicated in the dosing table, should not be exceeded.
2/ 33 Use in very young animals, or animals with suspected or confirmed impairment of renal, cardiac or hepatic function may involve additional risk.
If such use cannot be avoided, those dogs require careful veterinary monitoring.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animals, as there is a potential risk of increased renal toxicity.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.
Use this product under strict veterinary monitoring where there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, or if the animal previously displayed intolerance to NSAIDs.
Renal and/ or hepatic disorders have been reported in very rare cases in dogs administered the recommended treatment dose.
It is possible that a proportion of such cases had sub-clinical renal or hepatic disease prior to the commencement of therapy.
Therefore, appropriate laboratory testing to establish baseline renal or hepatic biochemistry parameters is recommended prior to and periodically during administration.
The treatment should be discontinued if any of these signs are observed: repeated diarrhoea, vomiting, faecal occult blood, sudden weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, degradation of renal or hepatic biochemistry parameters.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Wash hands after use of the product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Return halved tablets to the blister and keep out of the reach of children.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Emesis and diarrhoea have occasionally been reported.
These reactions are generally of a transitory nature and are reversible when the treatment is stopped.
Renal and/ or hepatic disorders have been reported in very rare cases in dogs administered the recommended treatment dose.
If adverse reactions like vomiting, repeated diarrhoea, faecal occult blood, sudden weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, degradation of renal or hepatic biochemistry parameters occur, use of the product should be stopped and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
As with other NSAIDs, serious adverse effects can occur and, in very rare cases, may be fatal.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in pregnant or lactating bitches.
Laboratory studies in rabbits have shown evidence of maternotoxic and foetotoxic effects at dose rates approximating the recommended treatment dose for the dog.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pre-treatment with other anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before the commencement of treatment with Previcox.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Previcox must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Gastrointestinal tract ulceration may be exacerbated by corticosteroids in animals given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Concomitant treatment with molecules displaying action on renal flow, e. g. diuretics or Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be subject to clinical monitoring.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided as there might be an increased risk
3/ 33 of renal toxicity.
As anaesthetic drugs may affect renal perfusion, the use of parenteral fluid therapy during surgery should be considered to decrease potential renal complications when using NSAIDs peri-operatively.
Concurrent use of other active substances that have a high degree of protein binding may compete with firocoxib for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Oral use.
Osteoarthritis:
Administer 5 mg per kg bodyweight once daily as presented in the table below.
Tablets can be administered with or without food.
Duration of treatment will be dependent on the response observed.
As field studies were limited to 90 days, longer-term treatment should be considered carefully and regular monitoring undertaken by the veterinarian.
Relief of post-operative pain Administer 5 mg per kg bodyweight once daily as presented in the table below for up to 3 days as needed, starting approximately 2 hours prior to surgery.
Following orthopaedic surgery and depending on the response observed, treatment using the same daily dosing schedule may be continued after the first 3 days, upon judgement of the attending veterinarian.

4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
In dogs ten weeks of age at the start of treatment at dose rates equal or greater to 25 mg/ kg/ day (5 times the recommended dose) for three months, the following signs of toxicity were observed: bodyweight loss, poor appetite, changes in the liver (accumulation of lipid), brain (vacuolisation), duodenum (ulcers) and death.
At dose rates equal or greater to 15 mg/ kg/ day (3 times the recommended dose) for six months, similar clinical signs were observed, albeit that the severity and frequency were less and duodenal ulcers were absent.
In those target animal safety studies, clinical signs of toxicity were reversible in some dogs following cessation of therapy.
In dogs seven months of age at the start of treatment at dose rates greater than or equal to 25 mg/ kg/ day (5 times the recommended dose) for six months, gastrointestinal adverse effects, i. e. vomiting were observed.
Overdose studies were not conducted in animals over 14 months of age.
If clinical signs of overdosing are observed, discontinue treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products, non-steroids.
ATCvet code:
QM01AH90
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Firocoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) belonging to the Coxib group, which acts by selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) – mediated prostaglandin synthesis.
Cyclooxygenase is responsible for generation of prostaglandins.
COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme that has been shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and has been postulated to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever.
Coxibs therefore display analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties.
COX-2 is also thought to be involved in ovulation, implantation and closure of the ductus arteriosus, and central nervous system functions (fever induction, pain perception and cognitive function).
In in-vitro canine whole blood assays, firocoxib exhibits approximately 380-fold selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1.
The concentration of firocoxib required to inhibit 50% of the COX-2 enzyme (i. e., the IC50) is 0.16 (± 0.05) µM, whereas the IC50 for COX-1 is 56 (± 7) µM.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Following oral administration in dogs at the recommended dose of 5 mg per kg of bodyweight, firocoxib is rapidly absorbed and the time to maximal concentration (Tmax) is 1.25 (± 0.85) hours.
The peak concentration (Cmax) is 0.52 (± 0.22) µg/ ml (equivalent to approximately 1.5 µM), area under the curve (AUC 0-24) is 4.63 (±1.91) µg xhr/ ml, and oral bioavailability is 36.9 (±20.4) percent.
The elimination half-life (t½) is 7.59 (± 1.53) hours.
Firocoxib is approximately 96% bound to plasma proteins.
Following multiple oral administrations, the steady state is reached by the third daily dose.
Firocoxib is metabolised predominantly by dealkylation and glucuronidation in the liver.
Elimination is principally in the bile and gastrointestinal tract.

Avoid contact with eyes and skin.
If it occurs, rinse affected area immediately with water.
Wash hands after use of the product.
Women of child-bearing age should avoid contact with, or wear disposable gloves, when administering the product.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Lesions (erosion/ ulceration) of the oral mucosa and of the skin around the mouth may occasionally be observed in treated animals.
Typically, these lesions are mild and resolve without treatment, but oral lesions may be associated with salivation and labial and tongue oedema.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
No data is available in horses.
However, studies with laboratory animals have shown embryo- foetotoxicity, malformations, delayed parturition and decreased pup survival.
Therefore, do not use in breeding, pregnant or lactating animals.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Other NSAIDs, diuretic and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and lead to toxic effects.
Do not use concomitantly with corticosteroids or other NSAIDs.
Pre-treatment with other anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and a treatment-free period with such products should therefore be observed.
The treatment- free period should take into account the pharmacological properties of the products used previously.
Concomitant treatment with molecules displaying action on renal flow (e. g. diuretics) should be subject to clinical monitoring.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided as there might be an increased risk of renal toxicity.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Oral use.
Administer 0.1 mg firocoxib per kg bodyweight, once daily.
Duration of treatment will be dependent on the response observed, but should not exceed 14 days.
To administer Previcox at the dose of 0.1 mg firocoxib/ kg, set the syringe plunger to the appropriate dose division for the horse’ s weight.
Each full dose division on the syringe plunger delivers sufficient firocoxib to treat 100 kg body weight.
The contents of one syringe will treat horses weighing up to 600 kg.
To ensure correct dosage, bodyweight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid overdosing.
To deliver firocoxib at the appropriate dosage, unlock the knurled ring on the syringe plunger by rotating it ¼ turn and slide it along the plunger shaft to the appropriate dose division for the horse’ s weight.
Rotate the plunger ring ¼ turn to lock it in place and ensure it is locked.
Make sure the horse’ s mouth contains no feed.
Remove the cover from the tip of the syringe.
Insert the syringe tip into the horse’ s mouth at the interdental space and deposit the paste on the base of the tongue.
9/ 33 4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Lesions (erosion/ ulceration) of the oral mucosa and of the skin around the mouth may occasionally be observed in treated animals when administered the recommended treatment dose.
Typically, these lesions are mild and resolve without treatment, but oral lesions may be associated with salivation and labial and tongue oedema.
The incidence of oral/ skin lesions increases with increasing dose.
At high dosages and prolonged treatment (3 times the recommended dose for 42 consecutive days and 2.5 times the recommended dose for 92 consecutive days administered once daily) mild to moderate renal lesions were observed.
If clinical signs occur, treatment should be discontinued and symptomatic treatment initiated.
4.11 Withdrawal period
Meat and offal:
26 days Do not use in mares producing milk for human consumption.

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Firocoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) belonging to the Coxib group, which acts by selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-mediated prostaglandin synthesis.
Cyclooxygenase is responsible for generation of prostaglandins.
COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme that has been shown to be induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and has been postulated to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever.
Coxibs therefore display analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.
COX-2 is also thought to be involved in ovulation, implantation and closure of the ductus arteriosus, and central nervous system functions (fever induction, pain perception, and cognitive function). “ In “ in vitro” equine whole blood assays, firocoxib exhibits 222 to 643 fold selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1.
The concentration of firocoxib required to inhibit 50% of the COX-2 enzyme (i. e., the IC50) is 0.0369 to 0.12 µM, whereas the IC50 for COX-1 is 20.14 to 33.1 µM.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Following oral administration in horses at the recommended dose of 0.1 mg per kg of bodyweight, firocoxib is rapidly absorbed, and the time to maximal concentration (Tmax) is 3.9 (± 4.4) hours.
The peak concentration (Cmax) is 0.075 (± 0.033) µg/ ml (equivalent to approximately 0.223 µM), area under the curve (AUC0-24) is 0.96 (± 0.26) µg x hr/ ml, and oral bioavailability is 79 (± 31) percent.
The elimination half-life (t½) after a single dose is 29.6 (± 7.5) hours and 50.6 hours after 14 days of dosing.
Firocoxib is approximately 97% bound to plasma proteins.
Following multiple oral administrations, the steady state is reached by approximately the eighth daily dose.
Firocoxib is metabolised predominantly by dealkylation and glucuronidation in the liver.
Elimination is principally in the excreta (primarily the urine), with some biliary excretion also observed.

28/ 33 12.
SPECIAL WARNING(S)
Use in very young animals, or animals with suspected or confirmed impairment of renal, cardiac or hepatic function may involve additional risk.
If such use cannot be avoided, those dogs require careful veterinary monitoring.
Appropriate laboratory testing is recommended prior to treatment in order to detect subclinical (asymptomatic) renal or hepatic disorders that may predispose to adverse effects.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animals, as there is a risk of increased renal toxicity.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.
Use this product under strict veterinary monitoring where there is a risk of gastro-intestinal bleeding, or if the animal previously displayed intolerance to NSAIDs.
The treatment should be discontinued if any of these signs are observed: repeated diarrhoea, vomiting, faecal occult blood, sudden weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, degradation of renal or hepatic biochemistry parameters.
As anaesthetic drugs may affect renal perfusion, the use of parenteral fluids during surgery should be considered to decrease potential renal complications when using NSAIDs peri-operatively.
Pre-treatment with other anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before the commencement of treatment with Previcox.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Previcox must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Gastrointestinal tract ulceration may be exacerbated by corticosteroids in animals given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Concomitant treatment with molecules displaying action on renal flow, e. g. diuretics or Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, should be subject to clinical monitoring.
Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided as there might be an increased risk for renal toxicity.
Concurrent use of other active substances that have a high degree of protein binding may compete with firocoxib for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert or the label to the physician.
Wash hands after use of the product.

OTHER INFORMATION
Mode of action:
Firocoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that acts by selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) – mediated prostaglandin synthesis.
COX-2 is the isoform of the enzyme
29/ 33 that has been postulated to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever.
In in-vitro canine whole blood assays, firocoxib exhibited approximately 380-fold selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1.
Previcox Chewable tablets are scored to facilitate accurate dosing and contain caramel and smoke flavours to facilitate administration to dogs.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
The chewable tablets are available in the following pack sizes:
57 mg:

ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
To administer Previcox at the dose of 0.1 mg firocoxib/ kg, set the syringe plunger to the appropriate dose division for the horse’ s weight.
Each full dose division on the syringe plunger delivers sufficient firocoxib to treat 100 kg body weight.
The contents of one syringe will treat horses weighing up to 600 kg.
To deliver firocoxib at the appropriate dosage, unlock the knurled ring on the syringe plunger by rotating it ¼ turn and slide it along the plunger shaft to the appropriate dose division for the horse’ s weight.
Rotate the plunger ring ¼ turn to lock it in place and ensure it is locked.
Make sure the horse’ s mouth contains no feed.
Remove the cover from the tip of the syringe.
Insert the syringe tip into the horse’ s mouth at the interdental space and deposit the paste on the base of the tongue.
