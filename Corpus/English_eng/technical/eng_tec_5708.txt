Using & kmplot;
& kmplot; deals with several different types of functions, which can be written in function form or as an equation:
Cartesian plots can either be written as & eg; y = x^2, where x has to be used as the variable; or as & eg; f(a) = a^2, where the name of the variable is arbitrary.
Parametric plots are similar to Cartesian plots. The x and y coordinates can be entered as equations in t, & eg; x = sin(t), y = cos(t), or as functions, & eg; f_x(s) = sin(s), f_y(s) = cos(s).
Polar plots are also similar to Cartesian plots. They can be either be entered as an equation in & thgr;, & eg; r = & thgr;, or as a function, & eg; f(x) = x.
For implicit plots, the name of the function is entered separately from the expression relating the x and y coordinates. If the x and y variables are specified via the function name (by entering & eg; f(a, b) as the function name), then these variables will be used. Otherwise, the letters x and y will be used for the variables.
Explicit differential plots are differential equations whereby the highest derivative is given in terms of the lower derivatives. Differentiation is denoted by a prime ('). In function form, the equation will look like f''(x) = f' & minus; f. In equation form, it will look like y '' = y '& minus; y. Note that in both cases, the (x) part is not added to the lower order differential terms (so you would enter f'(x) = & minus; f and not f'(x) = & minus; f(x)).
All the equation entry boxes come with a button on the right. Clicking this invokes the advanced Equation Editor dialog, which provides:
A variety of mathematical symbols that can be used in equations, but are n't found on normal keyboards.
The list of user constants and a button for editing them.
The list of predefined functions. Note that if you have text already selected, it will be used as the function argument when a function is inserted. For example, if 1 + x is selected in the equation y = 1 + x, and the sine function is chosen, then the equation will become y = sin(1+x).

Function Types
Cartesian Functions
To enter an explicit function (ie;, a function in the form y=f(x)) into & kmplot;, just enter it in the following form: f (x) = expression where:
f is the name of the function, and can be any string of letters and numbers.
x is the x-coordinate, to be used in the expression following the equals sign. It is a dummy variable, so you can use any variable name you like to achieve the same effect.
expression is the expression to be plotted, given in the appropriate syntax for & kmplot;. See.
Parametric Functions
Parametric functions are those in which the x and y coordinates are defined by separate functions of another variable, often called t. To enter a parametric function in & kmplot;, follow the procedure as for a Cartesian function for each of the x and y functions. As with Cartesian functions, you may use any variable name you wish for the parameter.
As an example, suppose you want to draw a circle, which has parametric equations x = sin(t), y = cos(t). After creating a parametric plot, enter the appropriate equations in the x and y boxes, & ie;, f_x(t)=sin(t) and f_y(t)=cos(t).
You can set some further options for the plot in the function editor:
Min
Max
These options control the range of the parameter t for which the function is plotted.
Functions in Polar Coordinates
Polar coordinates represent a point by its distance from the origin (usually called r), and the angle a line from the origin to the point makes with the x-axis (usually represented by & thgr; the Greek letter theta). To enter functions in polar coordinates, click the Create button and select Polar Plot from the list. In the definition box, complete the function definition, including the name of the theta variable you want to use, & eg;, to draw the Archimedes' spiral r = & thgr;, enter: r(thgr;) = & thgr;. Note that you can use any name for the theta variable, so r(t) = t or f(x) = x will produce exactly the same output.
Implicit Functions
An implicit expression relates the x and y coordinates as an equality. To create a circle, for example, click the Create button and select Implicit Plot from the list. Then, enter into the equation box (below the function name box) the following:
x^2 + y^2 = 25
Differential Functions
& kmplot; can plot explicit differential equations. These are equations of the form y (n) = F(x, y ', y' ',..., y (nminus; 1)), where y k is the k th derivative of y(x). & kmplot; can only interpret the derivative order as the number of primes following the function name. To draw a sinusoidal curve, for example, you would use the differential equation y' '= & minus; y or f''(x) =âˆ’ f.
However, a differential equation on its own is n't enough to determine a plot. Each curve in the diagram is generated by a combination of the differential equation and the initial conditions. You can edit the initial conditions by clicking on the Initial Conditions tab when a differential equation is selected. The number of columns provided for editing the initial conditions is dependent on the order of the differential equation.
Step
The step value in the precision box is used in numerically solving the differential equation (using the Runge Kutta method). Its value is the maximum step size used; a smaller step size may be used if part of the differential plot is zoomed in close enough.
Combining Functions
Functions can be combined to produce new ones. Simply enter the functions after the equals sign in an expression as if the functions were variables. For example, if you have defined functions f(x) and g(x), you can plot the sum of f and g with:
sum(x) = f(x) + g(x)
Changing the appearance of functions
To change the appearance of a function's graph on the main plot window, select the function in the Functions sidebar. You can change the plot's line width, color and many other aspects by clicking on the Color or Advanced... button at the bottom of the section Appearance.
If you are editing a Cartesian function, the function editor will have three tabs. In the first one you specify the equation of the function. The Derivatives tab lets you draw the first and second derivative to the function. With the Integral tab you can draw the integral of the function.
Popup menu
Graph right-click popup menu
Graph right-click popup menu
When right-clicking on a plot function or a single-point parametric plot function a popup menu will appear. In the menu there are three items available:
Edit
Selects the function in the Functions sidebar for editing.
Hide
Hides the selected graph. Other plots of the graph's function will still be shown.
Remove
Removes the function. All its graphs will disappear.
Animate Plot...
Displays the Parameter Animator dialog.
Calculator
Opens the Calculator dialog.
Depending on the plot type, there will also be up to four tools available:
Plot Area...
Select the minimum and maximum x-values for the graph in the new dialog that appears. Calculates the integral and draws the area between the graph and the x-axis in the selected range in the color of the graph.
Find Minimum...
Find the minimum value of the graph in a specified range. The selected graph will be highlighted in the dialog that appears. Enter the lower and upper boundaries of the region in which you want to search for a minimum.
Note: You can also tell the plot to visually show the extreme points in the Plot Appearance dialog, accessible in the Functions sidebar by clicking on Advanced....
Find Maximum...
This is the same as Find Minimum... above, but finds the maximum value instead of the minimum value.
Get y-Value
Opens a dialog in which you can find the y-value corresponding to a specific x-value. The selected graph will be highlighted in the dialog. Enter an x value in the X: box, and hit Enter. The corresponding y will be automatically calculated and shown underneath.
Search for Minimum Value
Search for Maximum Value
& kmplot; deals with named functions, which can be specified in terms of Cartesian coordinates (called explicit functions), polar coordinates or as parametric functions. To enter a function, choose Plot Edit Plots.... You can also enter new functions in the Function equation text box in the main & kmplot; window. The text box can handle explicit and polar functions. Each function you enter must have a unique name (ie;, a name that is not taken by any of the existing functions displayed in the list box). A function name will be automatically generated if you do not specify one.
For more information on & kmplot; functions, see.
As an example, to draw the graph of y=x 2 +2x, enter the following into the functions dialog of & kmplot;:
f(x)=x^2+2x
As an example, suppose you want to draw a circle, which has parametric equations x=sin(t), y=cos(t). In the & kmplot; functions dialog, do the following: Open the parametric plot dialog with Plot New Parametric Plot.... Enter a name for the function, say, circle, in the Name box. The names of the x and y functions change to match this name: the x function becomes xcircle(t) and the y function becomes ycircle(t). In the x and y boxes, enter the appropriate equations, & ie;, xcircle(t)= sin(t) and ycircle(t)= cos(t). Click on OK and the function will be drawn.
If this option is selected, the plot is not drawn, but & kmplot; remembers the function definition, so you can use it to define other functions.
Custom plot minimum-range
Custom plot maximum-range
If this options are selected, you can change the maximum and minimum values of the parameter t for which the function is plotted using the Min: and Max: boxes.
Line width:
With this option you can set the width of the line drawn on the plot area, in units of 0.1mm.
Color:
Click on the color box and pick a color in the dialog that appears. The line on the plot will be drawn in this color.
Note that you can only combine functions of the same type, & eg; an explicit function cannot be combined with a polar function.
Another way to edit a function is to right click on the graph. In the popup menu that appears, choose Edit
For more information on the popup menu, see.
Hide
Shows the editor dialog for the selected function.
Move
For plot functions the following four items are also available:
Area Under Graph
Draws the area between the graph and the x-axis. The selected graph will be highlighted in the new dialog that appears. For more information on the Search for Area Under Graph-feature, see.
