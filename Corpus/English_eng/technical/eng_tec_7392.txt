Autocompletion
Autocompletion automatically suggests functions and other code symbols after you start typing by trying to match existing symbols with the first characters typed. It will popup a drop-down menu where you can select a match by using the
Anjuta supports autocompletion for code written in C/C++, Vala, Javascript and Python. Note that autocompletion can only work if anjuta knows about the symbols used. If you are using C/C++ libraries that are not configured using
In addition some syntax might be too complex for the integrated parser and it might not be able to detect which completion is required
Effective coding using calltips
As it is usually quite hard to remember the signature of every method or function used in a project, the editor will automatically display a small tooltip whenever you type '(' after a function name and show you the signature.

Configuring and using auto-indentation
Manual configuration
Automatic indentation is configured in the preferences (
The big disadvantage of manually configuring indentation is that all developers working on a project must use the same settings or it will result if different styles used in the same files. For a better solution, see the next section.
Unless explicitely changed in the preferences the indentation settings found in the Modeline of a file will be used instead of the configured settings to keep the file consistent.
Modelines
Modelines are used to help editors to automatically detect the indentation mode which should be used for a particular file. They are especially useful if many developers work on the same project and use different environments.

Generating code for widgets
Introduction
In a GUI program, sometimes, some widgets are only important for generating events (eg: static buttons) while other ones are needed to get or show data to the user (eg: a text entry). In this later case, some code has to be generated so that these widgets can be accessed at runtime. With the glade plug-in,
Automatic generation
To automatically generate code for a widget, some conditions must be met: the glade plug-in must be running and the source file that will hold the code must be opened. To make sure that the glade plug-in is running, it is enough to open the
Once the glade plug-in is running and the file that will hold the code is being viewed, simply double click a widget in the glade inspector. The file being viewed will then be scanned for some marker comments (/* ANJUTA: Widgets declaration for application.ui - DO NOT REMOVE */ and /* ANJUTA: Widgets initialization for application.ui - DO NOT REMOVE */) and, if found, code will be added right after such comments. So, for this feature to work correctly, it is important not to modify such marker comments.

Autotools target type.
Autotools project type
There are different types of target available.
Shared Library (Libtool)
It represents a library shared by several programs which is linked at run time. It is the most common kind of libraries on Linux. It is called dynamic link library on Windows.
It uses the Libtool package. Its name must start with 'lib' and has the '.la' extension.
Module (Libtool)
It represents a library, often named a plugin, linked at run time explicitely by the program itself. It is used to only load the code corresponding to the used features.
It uses the Libtool package. Its name does not need the 'lib' prefix but must have the '.la' extension.
Static Library (Libtool)
It represents a library linked with the program at compile time. Only the function used are kept inside the generated executable.
It uses the Libtool package. Its name must start with 'lib' and has the '.a' extension.
Program
It represents compiled program by example from C souces files. All children represent the source files compiled to generate the program.
Python module
It represents a program written in Python.
Java module
It represents a progran written in Java.
LISP module
It represents a progran written in LISP.
Header files
This target allows you to group header files and define where they have to be installed.
Man documentation
It groups man pages needed by the project.
Info documentation
It groups info page needed by the project.
Miscellaneous Data
It groups data files which needed by the project like pictures, ui description, settings files...
Script
It represents program those are scripts. Those scripts are only installed in the specified directory. If scripts are generated additional rules are needed.
Build targets or project.
Build targets
A target is a file created from source files. Typically, it is a program or a library, but it could also be documentation if the documentation needs processing, for example.
The build command compiles all needed source files, and possibly links them with some other files, like libraries, in order to create the target. If some source files are already compiled and haven't been modified, they are not be recompiled, in order to save time. There are several ways to trigger a build.

Compile files

If checked, the project will be completely regenerated, else only the configure step is done.

You can have several configurations having their own options and build directory, this text box allows to name them. Typically you have already defined a Default configuration, a Debug configuration making programs easier to debug (keeping intermediate variables and code ordering) and an Optimized configuration generating faster programs but increasing build time. You can define additional custom configurations.

Select here the build directory. It can be the project directory or a subdirectory. This is particularly useful when switching between different configurations to avoid rebuilding the whole project.
With autotools, you cannot have one configuration using a different directory if you already have one configuration using the project directory. You need to remove it first.
Some autotools project cannot be built outside the project directory. You can still use different configurations but they all have to use the project directory and everything will be recompiled on each change of the configuration.

This text box list all command line arguments used by the configure step. All arguments are separated by spaces and must be quoted if they contains a space. Each configuration fills this text box with default values that you can modify.
Each autotools project supports a common list of arguments but can have specify arguments. You can have a list of all accepted arguments by running
Configure an autotools project and manage configurations.
Configure a project
Before compiling and building files, an autotools project has to be configured. This step is needed to set global options, to check that all required libraries and programs are installed on your system and to generate appropriate build scripts.
Configure the project
From the

Install targets
Unless your project is very simple, it needs some data files like user interface description files. These files are typically copied in standard directories and read from there.

Autotools build plugin
This plugin is targeted at autotools projects but as they use make it is useful for other kind of projects using make.
Make command used
Here is a list of the targets used by the plugin. They are implemented in all autotools projects but you need to implement them if you use a custom makefile.

Use to compile an source file. The object file name is found by replacing the source file extension with the corresponding object extension.

Use to build all targets in a directory.

Use to install all targets in a directory.

Use to delete all file built in a directory.

Use to build a distributation package, called only in the project directory.
As make comes with default rules allowing it to compile and link a C program without needing a makefile. You can compile a C program from a single source file without a makefile nor a project.

Used to create or edit a breakpoint
Breakpoint Dialog

This is the position of the breakpoint. For an existing breakpoint, you cannot change this. You can set a breakpoint at a certain line number, or at the beginning of a function. Use one of the following formats:




The break condition is an expression which should evaluate to a boolean value
If you leave this field blank the condition is always considered

The debugger can also skip the breakpoint a certain number of times before breaking. If the pass count is not zero, then the debugger will have to encounter the breakpoint this number of times before breaking.
The pass count has a higher priority than the condition. Only when the pass count has been reached will the debugger evaluate the condition if it is present and break the program's execution.
Managing breakpoints.
Breakpoints
Breakpoints are used to stop the execution of the program at a particular point so that the state of the program can be examined at those locations.
Listing breakpoints
From the
This view has the following columns:
Location
This is the position of the breakpoint in the source file. When the breakpoint is set by the debugger, you can get additional information such as the function containing the breakpoint.
Address
This field is filled with the address of the breakpoint when it is set by the debugger.
Type
This always displays
Condition
This is the breakpoint condition. It is empty if no condition is defined.
Pass count
When the debugger is not running, this column displays the pass count of the breakpoint, or zero if it is not defined.
When the debugger is running, if the pass count is zero, this column displays the number of times this breakpoint has been triggered. If the pass count is not zero, both numbers are displayed. The pass count is the second number.
State
This is the state of the breakpoint. It may be
Pending:
the breakpoint is not set in your program.
Permanent:
the breakpoint is set (its id number is displayed in parentheses).
Temporary:
the breakpoint is set but will be deleted if reached.
All breakpoints are kept across Anjuta sessions even if they correspond to a non-existing locations, for example in a source file of a shared library not loaded yet. In this case their states are set as pending.

Stack
List stack frames
A stack frame is the area of the stack associated to each function call. It lists all functions and their arguments in the sequence they were called. Each stack frame is numbered starting from 0 for the current function. You can only view the stack frames while the debugger is running.
Moreover, a program can be composed of several threads. Each thread is executed independently and has its own registers, stack and local variables, but shares all global variables.
From the
The stacks are displayed in a tree view having their corresponding thread as parent and displaying the following information:
Active
This contains a yellow arrow to represent the active stack frame. By default it is frame 0, the current function. All evaluations and local variables are relative to this active frame. You can change the active stack frame to examine local variables in other functions.
Thread
This is a number corresponding to each thread.

Step in
From the
Single stepping executes only one statement of the program (from the place where it has stopped) and then returns control.

Makefile project backend.
Makefile project backend plugin
A makefile is probably the most common way to build software on all kinds of platforms. A makefile contains a list or rules describing which commands have to be run in order to generate a target from a list of dependencies. When building a program, the target is an object file and the dependencies are the source files. The target of one rule can be a dependency of another one, allowing several rules to be chained in order to make a final target.
It is a low-level, general tool, making it difficult to find all source files and targets of a project. So
If the project backend is not able to find all the source files, you can try to use the directory backend instead. It does not recognize any targets but should get all source files.
Changing properties, or adding or removing targets and source files are disabled with this backend, as automatically editing the makefile is not implemented. It has to be changed by hand using the text editor. When the makefile is saved, it is automatically reloaded though.

View a Project
A project is represented by a tree, the root item corresponds to the project while children represent programs, libraries, directories and source files. Each item can have properties allowing to set more details like project version, compiler flags or installation directories. These item are divided in several categories, depending on the backend not all are available:
Root
There is only one node of this kind. It represents the project itself. It is the place where you can set project wide properties like the project name or the project version.
Module
This is a set of packages used in autotools project. They appear as children of the root node to represent all modules defined and as children of each target using them. For more details, see
Package
This is a packaged library used in autotools project. They appear as children of each module. For more details, see
Folder
This is used to group targets allowing to set common properties. They are often implemented by sub directories. For more details, see
Target
It groups files and define how they are used. There are several kinds of targets, by example program, library or data, corresponding to different use of the child files. They often represent generated project files like compiled programs or libraries. For more details see
You can drag and drop targets at the beginning of the project tree view to create a shortcut allowing to access them more easily. By default all program targets are already put here.
Source
Each source file is represented by a item in the project view. The use of each file depends on its parent target. All children of a program target are compiled to generate it. While children of a data target are only copied to a directory when the project is installed. For more details see
