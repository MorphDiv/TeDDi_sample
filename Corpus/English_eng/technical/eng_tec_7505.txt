This documentation is for version 3.00 of Ekiga.
Ekiga is an application for voice over IP, IP telephony, and video conferencing, with support for many audio and video codecs.
Ekiga
Introduction

Ekiga is able to use modern Voice over IP protocols like SIP and H.323. It supports all major features defined by those protocols like
SIP and H.323
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a protocol developed by the IETF MMUSIC Working Group and proposed standard for initiating, modifying, and terminating an interactive user session that involves multimedia elements such as video, voice, instant messaging, online games, and virtual reality. In November 2000, SIP was accepted as a 3GPP signaling protocol and permanent element of the IMS architecture. It is one of the leading signalling protocols for Voice over IP.
H.323 was originally created to provide a mechanism for transporting multimedia applications over LANs but it has rapidly evolved to address the growing needs of VoIP networks. One strength of H.323 was the relatively early availability of a set of standards, not only defining the basic call model, but in addition the supplementary services, needed to address business communication expectations. H.323 was the first VoIP standard to adopt the IETF standard RTP to transport audio and video over IP networks. H.323 is based on the ISDN Q.931 protocol and is suited for interworking scenarios between IP and ISDN, respectively between IP and QSIG. A call model, similar to the ISDN call model, eases the introduction of IP Telephony into existing networks of ISDN based PBX systems.

Basic Usage
Calling and being called
From computer to computer (PC-To-PC)
If you want to call other users and to be callable, you need a SIP address. You can get a SIP address from
The SIP address can be used by other users to call you. Similarly, you can use the SIP address of your friends and family to call them. You can for example use
You can use the online address book of
If you know the URI address of the party that you wish to call, you may enter that URI into the sip: input box at the top of the screen and press the Connect button; eg: sip:foo@ekiga.net and pressing the Connect button would call the user at that address.
It is also possible to call contacts using the address book, the call history or the roster. You can add contacts you call frequently to your roster, and watch their presence information in order to know when they are available. Please refer to the appropriate section of the manual for full explanations.

From computer to real phones (PC-To-Phone)

With the default setup, you can simply use sip:3210444555 and select sip.diamondcard.us in the list to call the real phone number +3210444555, 32 is the country code, 10444555 is the number to call.
You can also dial real phone numbers from the address book. If the phone number of the contact you want to call is stored in the address book, simply select Action -gt; Call [Ekiga Call Out] when the contact is highlighted. It will dial the phone number of the contact using the Ekiga Call Out account.

From real phone to computer (Phone-To-PC)

You can actually use any H.323 or SIP ITSP provider, including your own PBX at work. However we recommend using the integrated provider.
Managing Contacts
Adding contacts to the roster

You can thus use

To add a contact to the roster, select Chat-gt;Add Contact, and fill in the required fields. If the service managing the URI you entered for the contact is able to publish presence status, Ekiga will automatically display it.
If you do not know the VoIP URI of a contact, you might try searching for him using the Ekiga.net online directory. To do so, select Chat -gt; Address Book, and start searching using the 'Search Filter' feature.
You can organise your contacts in groups in the roster.
Managing contacts


The LDAP Address Book supports a range of settings to allow it to work with any LDAPv3 directory. It allows you to choose the attribute to use for displaying a contact's name in the address book as well as a list of attributes for callng info. E.g., if the directory uses the LDAP inetOrgPerson schema you can configure the Address Book to retrieve the homePhone, mobile, and pager attributes make those values available for calling or messaging. You can also customize a Filter Template for the default LDAP search filter, and override the default filter at any time if you need to perform a more specialized search. The browser also supports all security options for LDAP including ldaps:// (LDAP over SSL), StartTLS, and SASL authentication.
To refresh the list of users for a specific address book, simply click the Find button. It will search for all users in that address book. You can contact people by double clicking on their highlighted field. You can also message them by right-clicking or by choosing the appropriate action in the Action menu of the window.
In certain cases you will want to search specifically for a person name, or his or her call URI in the
The
Editing contacts
Local address books provided by Novell Evolution allow you to add new contacts, or to edit existing contacts. Each different address book allows a different set of features depending on what makes sense for the address book in question. To discover what features are possible, simply select the address book and consult the Action menu.
To add a contact to one of your local address books, simply select the address book you wish to add the contact to and select Action -gt; New Contact. The option of adding a New Contact will appear and you may now enter his name and VoIP URI as well as other settings. After complete select 'OK' and now your contact has been added. You can only add contacts to local address books. The contact parameters can be changed at any time by selecting Action -gt; Properties when the contact is highlighted. He can also be deleted by selecting Action -gt; Remove.
You can also add a contact from the white pages (or any other local or remote address book) to the roster by selecting Action -gt; Add to local roster when the contact is highlighted.
Finally, you can edit the groups your users belong to using the Action -gt; Properties dialog when the contact is highlighted.
Sending instant messages

You can send instant messages from the roster, from the call history or from the address book. From the roster or from the call history, simply select Contact -gt; Message in the main window when a contact is highlighted. From the address book window, simply select Action -gt; Message when the contact is highlighted. A window pops up, enter your text message, and hit the Enter key.
You can not exchange text messages with all protocols.
Updating his own status

There are three categories of status messages : online, away and do not disturb. Each of them allows you to specify a more complete status information. Simply select Custom message in the status menu at the bottom of the main window. You can then define your extended status message that will be published using all available protocols supporting it.
Many servers will not support relaying your extended presence information. To make sure that this feature is available with the server you are using or with the PBX you are connected to, please ask your administrator. Please note that Ekiga.net will publish your presence information.
Managing Calls
Forwarding incoming calls

Notice that you need to specify an URI where to forward calls in the preferences to be able to activate that option. Open the preferences window by choosing Edit -gt; Preferences in the main window and select Call Options on the left. You will now see the appropriate section. It contains three checkboxes for the three cases described above. The URI of the party the calls shall be forwarded to can be configured separately in SIP Settings for SIP and accordingly in H.323 Settings for H.323.
Controlling the call

Ending a call: The communication to the remote user can be ended by selecting Chat -gt; Hang up.
Holding a call: You can hold a remote party call by selecting Chat -gt; Hold Call. This effectively pauses Video and Audio transmission; to continue transmission again you select Chat -gt; Retrieve Call and Video and Audio Transmission will begin again.
Suspend Audio: This effectively prevents all Audio communication to your respective party when selecting Chat -gt; Suspend Audio.
Suspend Video: This effectively prevents all Video transmission to your respective party when selecting Chat -gt; Suspend Video.
Transferring the remote party: You can transfer the remote user to another user by selecting Chat -gt; Transfer Call. It is also possible to transfer an active call by right-clicking and choosing the transfer action when a contact is highlighted in the roster, in the address book or in the call history. Double-clicking or selecting the Contact menu in the main window or the Action menu in the Address Book window and choosing the transfer action will also work.
All URIs supported by
Adjusting the audio and video settings
Your audio and video settings can be adjusted through the call panel while you are in a call. If you want to change the audio or video settings during a call, simply show the Call Panel by select View -gt; Show Call Panel in the menu. The audio volume, but also the brightness, whiteness, color and contrast of your video input device can be changed to achieve the best quality.
You can also change your audio and video devices during a call. Simply go in the preferences window by selecting Edit -gt; Preferences in the menu, and adjust your devices in the appropriate section.
Checking the call history
Received calls contains all incoming calls which were accepted by
Placed calls keeps track of all attempts - successful or not - to call another user.
Missed calls shows incoming calls which timed out.
The Call History stores information (date, duration, URI, Remote user) about all outgoing and incoming calls. They are divided into three groups - received calls, placed calls and missed calls. You can consult the call history by selecting View -gt; Call History in the menu.
Double-clicking on a row in the Calls History will call back the selected user or transfer any active call to that user. Notice that you can also add the contact to your roster by selecting Chat -gt; Contact -gt; Add to local roster in the main menu when the call is highlighted.
Advanced Usage
Registering Additional Accounts

Understanding URIs
SIP URI's
SIP URIs are formatted as such "sip:user@[host[:port]]"
This permits you to call the given user or extension on the specified SIP proxy:
H.323 URIs
H.323 URIs are formatted as such "h323:[user@][host[:port]]"
Call a given host on a port different from the default port which is 1720:
Call a given user using their respective alias if registered to a gatekeeper:
Call a given phone number if you are registered to a gatekeeper for a PC-To-Phone provider, or if that user has an ENUM record associated to an H.323 URI:
Call a given user using their alias through a specific gateway or proxy:
Call an MCU and join a specific room:
This permits you to:
Controlling the Video Bandwidth

Notice that the algorithm is a best-effort algorithm, which means that if your video bandwidth settings are too low, it can be impossible to respect them. However, if the video bandwidth permits to transmit with a better quality, or faster than the requested values, then
Choosing a higher framerate and a lower quality will have the same result in terms of video bandwidth as choosing a higher quality with a lower framerate. The choice depends on if you prefer using your bandwidth to transmit more lower quality images or fewer high quality images.

Reordering the codecs
When you reorder the codecs, you are reordering the local capabilities table, ie the codecs you will use for sending. You will always transmit audio and video using the first codec in the corresponding table that is in common with the remote user. The remote user will transmit audio and video using the first codec in his table that is common with you.
Forcing the use of a specific codec
You can force the use of a specific codec by disabling all other codecs, but it will result in failed calls if the remote user doesn't support that specific codec. The best approach is to put your preferred codecs at the top of the list so that you always transmit with them if the remote user allows it and to disable the codecs that you don't want to use for transmission and reception.
Adjusting the jitter buffer
You can adjust the delay to wait before playing the sound buffers that you have received using the jitter buffer adjustment. If there is too much packet loss, the delay required to have received all packets could be so important that it will exceed the jitter buffer. In such a case, the sound you are receiving will be of bad quality. A solution to that problem would be to increase the maximum limit of the jitter buffer to a few seconds, resulting in a big delay but in an improved voice quality. Notice that the jitter buffer will readapt itself to the lowest delay allowing for optimum transmission, and that a bad voice quality in reception is not due to a too low jitter buffer value, but to bad internet connection quality.

Outbound Proxy
The outbound proxy is the SIP proxy that will relay your calls. The behavior of a SIP proxy is similar to the behavior of an HTTP proxy, i.e. some entity that issues the requests on your behalf and proxies the streams.
Forward URI
The URI to which SIP incoming calls should be forwarded if configured in the preferences.
Controlling the H.323 Settings
The URI to which H.323 incoming calls should be forwarded if configured in the preferences.
Advanced Settings

H.245 Tunneling
H.245 Tunneling is the encapsulation of H.245 messages within H.225/Q.931 messages (H.245 Tunneling). If you have a firewall and enable H.245 Tunneling, there is one less TCP port that you need to allow for incoming connections.
Early H.245
This enables H.245 early in the setup and permits achieving faster call initiation.
Fast Start
Fast Connect is a new method of call setup that bypasses some usual steps in order to make it faster. In addition to the speed improvement, Fast Connect allows the media channels to be operational before the CONNECT message is sent, which is a requirement for certain billing procedures. It was introduced in H.323 version 2.
