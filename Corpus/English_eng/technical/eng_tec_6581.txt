Your images/ videos are not sorted, which means that navigating using the date bar will only work suboptimally. In the Maintenance menu, you can find Display Images with Incomplete Dates which you can use to find the images that are missing date information. You can then select the images that you have reason to believe have a correct date in either their EXIF data or on the file, and execute Maintenance- > Read EXIF Info to reread the information. Finally, once all images have their dates set, you can execute Images- > Sort Selected by Date & Time to sort them in the database.
Your images/ videos are not sorted, which means that navigating using the date bar will only work suboptimally. You also do not have EXIF support available, which means that you cannot read image dates from JPEG metadata. It is strongly recommended to recompile KPhotoAlbum with the exiv2 library. After you have done so, you will be asked what to do to correct all the missing information.
Images/ Videos Are Not Sorted
Not all the images in the database have information about image sizes; this is needed to get the best result in the thumbnail view. To fix this, simply go to the Maintainance menu, and first choose Remove All Thumbnails, and after that choose Build Thumbnails. Not doing so will result in extra space around images in the thumbnail view - that is all - so there is no urgency in doing it.
Not All Images Have Size Information
The index. xml file read was from an older version of KPhotoAlbum. KPhotoAlbum read the old format without problems, but to be able to convert back to KimDaBa 2.1 format, you need to run the current KPhotoAlbum using the flag export-in-2.1-format, and then save.

Welcome to KPhotoAlbum Import This wizard will take you through the steps of an import operation. The steps are: First you must select which images you want to import from the export file. You do so by selecting the checkbox next to the image. Next you must tell KPhotoAlbum in which directory to put the images. This directory must of course be below the directory root KPhotoAlbum uses for images. KPhotoAlbum will take care to avoid name clashes The next step is to specify which categories you want to import (People, Places,...) and also tell KPhotoAlbum how to match the categories from the file to your categories. Imagine you load from a file, where a category is called Blomst (which is the Danish word for flower), then you would likely want to match this with your category, which might be called Blume (which is the German word for flower) - of course given you are German. The final steps, is matching the individual tokens from the categories. I may call myself Jesper in my image database, while you want to call me by my full name, namely Jesper K. Pedersen. In this step non matches will be highlighted in red, so you can see which tokens was not found in your database, or which tokens was only a partial match.

Limit maximum image dimensions to:
If your images are stored in a non-compressed file format then you may check this; otherwise, this just wastes time during import and export operations. In other words, do not check this if your images are stored in jpg, png or gif; but do check this if your images are stored in tiff.
Generate thumbnail images
With this option you may limit the maximum dimensions (width and height) of your images. Doing so will make the resulting export file smaller, but will of course also make the quality worse if someone wants to see the exported images with larger dimensions.
When exporting images, bear in mind that there are two things the person importing these images again will need: 1) meta information (image content, date etc.) 2) the images themselves. The images themselves can either be placed next to the. kim file, or copied into the. kim file. Copying the images into the. kim file works well for a recipient who wants all, or most of those images, for example when emailing a whole group of images. However, when you place the images on the Web, a lot of people will see them but most likely only download a few of them. It works better in this kind of case, to separate the images and the. kim file, by place them next to each other, so the user can access the images s/ he wants.

Other KPhotoAlbum users may now load the import file into their database, by choosing import in the file menu. If they find it on a web site, and the web server is correctly configured, all they need to do is simply to click it from within konqueror. To enable this, your web server needs to be configured for KPhotoAlbum. You do so by adding the following line to / etc/ httpd/ mime. types or similar: application/ vnd. kde. kphotoalbum-import kim This will make your web server tell konqueror that it is a KPhotoAlbum file when clicking on the link, otherwise the web server will just tell konqueror that it is a plain text file.

Description
Date and Time
On KPhotoAlbum's home page (http: / /www. kphotoalbum. org/) you may see a few videos featuring a number of different KPhotoAlbum features.
It is possible to create new categories - that are alternatives to People, Places, and Events - in the annotation dialog. To add new categories or remove existing ones, go to the Settings-gt; Configure KPhotoAlbum dialog, and choose Categories in the side bar.
You may rename or delete a person, location, keyword or similar by right-clicking on the item in the image property dialog.
When generating HTML you must specify a base directory for the images. Here you can specify any protocol supported by KDE, like ftp or fish. Examples: ftp: / /someserver/ my-upload-area/ images (upload using FTP) fish: / /someserver/ home/ foo/ images (upload using ssh) smb: / /someserver/ c/ images (upload to a Windows share)
When you bring new images to your collection, you might not have time right away to categorize them (i. e. specify People, Places, etc.). Therefore, you might later want to find those images which have not yet been categorized. Here is what I do. I use the keyword OK, which I set on images, once I've categorized them (i. e. just like you may have a keyword for Summer Party or Interrail trip 1990, you now have a keyword OK). To find uncategorized images, I choose the Search item from the browser, and in the keywords field, I type! OK. This will find all images which do not have the OK item.
You can reorder images on your hard disk after having loaded them into KPhotoAlbum - KPhotoAlbum will still remember them, as it calculates checksums for the images.
If you like KPhotoAlbum, and it adds value to your daily life, please consider donating money to the KPhotoAlbum developer as a courtesy. See http: / /www. kphotoalbum. org/ support. htm.
It's possible to associate images with categories. That way when browsing, say people, you may get a small icon for each person with e. g. the person's face. To specify an icon for a person, load the person in the viewer, zoom to the part which you want to make into an icon, and choose Show Category Editor. This will bring up a dialog where you can find the person, and set the image.
You may close the image annotation dialog (the one where you specify people, places, etc. for the images) by pressing Ctrl+Enter.
KPhotoAlbum has a mailing list at http: / /klaralvdalens-datakonsult. se/ mailman/ listinfo/ kphotoalbum, and an IRC channel named #kphotoalbum on irc. kde. org.
You may reorder images by dragging and dropping one image onto another. If you drop it on the left edge, it will end up in front of the other, if you drop it on the right edge it will be inserted behind. -- Tip contributed by Eivind Kjorstad
On the thumbnail view, you can resize the grid to your needs just by clicking the middle mouse button and dragging around. On most systems you can emulate the middle mouse button by left and right clicking at the same time. -- Tip contributed by Rafael Beccar
You can rate images using the numbers from 0 to 5 on the keyboard whilst in thumbnail view or the image viewer. In the annotation dialog, you can rate images by selecting the appropriate star rating.
This is the last tip. If you know any additional tips or tricks, then please send an email to blackie@kde. org.

KPhotoAlbum will try to read the image date from EXIF information in the image. If that fails it will try to get the date from the file's time stamp. However, this information will be wrong if the image was scanned in (you want the date the image was taken, not the date of the scan). If you only scan images, in contrast to sometimes using a digital camera, you should reply no. If you never scan images, you should reply yes, otherwise reply ask. This will allow you to decide whether the images are from the scanner or the camera, from session to session.
JPEG images may contain information about rotation. If you have a reason for not using this information to get a default rotation of your images, uncheck this check box. Note: Your digital camera may not write this information into the images at all.
JPEG images may contain a description. Check this checkbox to specify if you want to use this as a default description for your images.
KPhotoAlbum is capable of searching for new images and videos when started, this does, however, take some time, so instead you may wish to manually tell KPhotoAlbum to search for new images using Maintenance- > Rescan for new images
KPhotoAlbum is capable of reading certain kinds of RAW images. Some cameras store both a RAW image and a matching JPEG or TIFF image. This causes duplicate images to be stored in KPhotoAlbum, which may be undesirable. If this option is checked, KPhotoAlbum will not read RAW files for which matching image files also exist.
KPhotoAlbum shares plugins with other imaging applications, some of which have the concept of albums. KPhotoAlbum does not have this concept; nevertheless, for certain plugins to function, KPhotoAlbum behaves to the plugin system as if it did. KPhotoAlbum does this by defining the current album to be the current view - that is, all the images the browser offers to display. In addition to the current album, KPhotoAlbum must also be able to give a list of all albums; the list of all albums is defined in the following way: When KPhotoAlbum's browser displays the content of a category, say all People, then each item in this category will look like an album to the plugin. Otherwise, the category you specify using this option will be used; e. g. if you specify People with this option, then KPhotoAlbum will act as if you had just chosen to display people and then invoke the plugin which needs to know about all albums. Most users would probably want to specify Events here.
Show the KPhotoAlbum splash screen on start up
When KPhotoAlbum searches for new files and finds a file that matches the modified file search regexp it is assumed that an original version of the image may exist. The regexp pattern will be replaced with the original file string text and if that file exists, all associated metadata (category information, ratings, etc) will be copied from the original file to the new one.
KPhotoAlbum can make a copy of an image before opening it with an external program. These settings set the original regexp to search for and contents to replace it with when deciding what the new filename should be.
Choose Plugins to load:
Delay loading plugins until the plugin menu is opened
When reading time information of images, their EXIF info is used. Exif info may, however, not be supported by your KPhotoAlbum installation, or no valid information may be in the file. As a backup, KPhotoAlbum may use the timestamp of the image - this may, however, not be valid in case the image is scanned in. So the question is, should KPhotoAlbum trust the time stamp on your images?

KPhotoAlbum is capable of backing up the index. xml file by keeping copies named index. xml~1~ index. xml~2~ etc. and you can use the spinbox to specify the number of backup files to keep. KPhotoAlbum will delete the oldest backup file when it reaches the maximum number of backup files. The index. xml file may grow substantially if you have many images, and in that case it is useful to ask KPhotoAlbum to zip the backup files to preserve disk space.
KPhotoAlbum is using a single index. xml file as its data base. With lots of images it may take a long time to read this file. You may cut down this time to approximately half, by checking this check box. The disadvantage is that the index. xml file is less readable by human eyes.

Feature Status
Overview Below you may see the list of compile- and runtime features KPhotoAlbum has, and their status: %1
What can I do if I miss a feature? If you compiled KPhotoAlbum yourself, then please review the sections below to learn what to install to get the feature in question. If on the other hand you installed KPhotoAlbum from a binary package, please tell whoever made the package about this defect, eventually including the information from the section below. In case you are missing a feature and you did not compile KPhotoAlbum yourself, please do consider doing so. It really is n't that hard. If you need help compiling KPhotoAlbum, feel free to ask on the KPhotoAlbum mailing listThe steps to compile KPhotoAlbum can be seen on the KPhotoAlbum home page. If you have never compiled a KDE application, then please ensure that you have the developer packages installed, in most distributions they go under names like kdelibs-devel
Plug-ins SupportKPhotoAlbum has a plug-in system with lots of extensions. You may among other things find plug-ins for: Writing images to cds or dvd'sAdjusting timestamps on your imagesMaking a calendar featuring your imagesUploading your images to flickrUpload your images to facebookThe plug-in library is called KIPI, and may be downloaded from the KIPI Home page
EXIF support Images store information like the date the image was shot, the shooting angle, focal length, and shutter-speed in what is known as EXIF information. KPhotoAlbum uses the EXIV2 library to read EXIF information from images
SQL Database Support KPhotoAlbum allows you to search using a certain number of EXIF tags. For this KPhotoAlbum needs an Sqlite database. In addition the qt package for sqlite (e. g. qt-sql-sqlite) must be installed.
Video Thumbnails SupportKPhotoAlbum asks the KDE plug-in system for help when it needs to generate a thumbnail for videos. Unfortunately KDE4 does currently not come with any plug-ins for this, you therefore need manually to install MPlayerThumbs.
Video Support KPhotoAlbum relies on Qt's Phonon architecture for displaying videos; this in turn relies on GStreamer. If this feature is not enabled for you, have a look at the KPhotoAlbum wiki article on video support.
No video mime types found, which indicates that either Qt was compiled without phonon support, or there were missing codecs

Check My Feature Set
KPhotoAlbum requires that all your images and videos are stored with a common root directory. You are allowed to store your images in a directory tree under this directory. KPhotoAlbum will not modify or edit any of your images, so you can simply point KPhotoAlbum to the directory where you already have all your images located.

Delete Your Temporary Demo Database I hope you enjoyed the KPhotoAlbum demo. The demo database was copied to / tmp, should it be deleted now? If you do not delete it, it will waste disk space; on the other hand, if you want to come back and try the demo again, you might want to keep it around with the changes you made through this session.

KPhotoAlbum hit an internal error (missing plug-in menu in MainWindow: :Window: :setupPluginMenu). This indicate that you forgot to do a make install. If you did compile KPhotoAlbum yourself, then please run make install. If not, please report this as a bug. KPhotoAlbum will continue execution, but it is not entirely unlikely that it will crash later on due to the missing make install.

Enter the command you want to run on your image file(s). KPhotoAlbum will run your command and replace any '%all 'tokens with a list of your files. For example, if you entered: cp %all / tmp Then the files you selected would be copied to the / tmp directory You can also use %each to have a command be run once per file.

You did not specify a base directory. This is the topmost directory for your images. Under this directory you will find each generated collection in separate directories.

You did not specify an output directory. This is a directory containing the actual images. The directory will be in the base directory specified above.

Error while reading information about %1. This is most likely because the directory does not exist.
%1 does not exist, is not a directory or cannot be written to.
Output directory %1 already exists. Usually, this means you should specify a new directory. Should %2 be deleted first?

Really reorder thumbnails? By dragging images around in the thumbnail viewer, you actually reorder them. This is very useful where you do not know the exact date for the images. On the other hand, if the images have valid timestamps, you should use Images -gt; Sort Selected By Date and Time.
