The Menu and Toolbar Items
& kpresenter; presents different types of interfaces for you to interact with the program. Perhaps the most familiar type of interface is the menu which appears on the top of the & kpresenter; window.
Clicking on the menu items gives you a list of commands from which you can choose the one you want. Many of the commands can also be accessed directly by holding down & Ctrl; or & Alt; and pressing another key on your keyboard. In the next section, each of the menu commands is described in brief.
The Toolbars
Manipulating the Toolbars
In addition to the menus, & kpresenter; also has a set of toolbars. Each toolbar consists of a collection of icons. A toolbar icon often presents a convenient shortcut to a command that is found in one of the menus.
The toolbars
The toolbars
You can move the toolbar around by dragging the handle, shown here in red. Toolbars can be docked or attached to any side of the & kpresenter; window. If you like, you can also have the toolbar float in its own window, separated from the main & kpresenter; window as shown in the screenshot below:
Floating toolbar
Floating toolbar
If you do n't like dragging toolbars around, right click on the handle and a menu pops up as shown in the screenshot below:
Toolbar context menu
Toolbar context menu
The first few items in the popup menu have to do with the placement of the toolbar. You can choose any of the four sides of the & kpresenter; window, or have the toolbar float in a separate window. Choosing Flat hides the toolbar. To unflat a hidden toolbar, & LMB; click on its handle.
Choosing the next item in the menu, Text Position, leads to an additional menu which lets you control the appearance of the items in toolbar. This additional cascading menu is shown in the screenshot below:
The toolbar modes menu
The toolbar modes menu
The default view of the toolbar is icons only. In this view, if you do n't know what a particular icon means, you can hold the mouse over the icon, and after a second or so, a little hint pops up in a highlighted text box as shown in the screenshot below:
Tooltips
Tooltips
You can choose to display the toolbar items as text instead of icons, or even to combine both icons and text. If you want both text and icons, the cascading menu allows you to select whether the text appears beside the icons or below them. All four styles of displaying toolbar items are shown in the screenshot below:

This item can be toggled. If enabled, formatting characters are visible; if disabled, they are not.
View Guide Lines
When working in & kpresenter; you can drag a guide line from either the horizontal or vertical ruler onto your document. This guide-line will not print or display in the finished presentation, it is simply to help you align objects on screen. If this item is enabled, these guide lines will be visible. If this is disabled, they will not be visible.
Guide lines work across slides, allowing you to align objects the same way across multiple slides.
Disabling (hiding) guide lines does not delete them. If you have created guide lines, and then disabled this item, enabling it again will retain the guide lines you created.
View Add Guide Line...
Opens a dialog to select the Orientation (Horizontal or Vertical) and choose a Position:
View Show/ Hide Grid

View Snap to Grid
If this is enabled, when dropping or moving objects on the slide the top left corner of the object will snap or move, to the nearest grid point.
This does reduce your freedom to freely position objects on the slide, however it also helps to line up objects precisely. It is easily disabled or enabled with this menu entry, allowing you the best of both worlds.
View Zoom
This submenu allows you to zoom in or out of the slide. Several predefined zoom levels are available, including Whole Slide to scale the entire slide so as to be visible in the size window you have open, and Width to scale the slide so it fills the entire width of the window, although you may now have to scroll vertically.

The Properties dialog
The Properties dialog for an object allows you to manipulate it in a very detailed manner. You can change several properties for the selected object, like the text color if the object is text or the depth if the object is a picture.
Format Arrange Objects
This is where you can manipulate the stacking order of objects on the slide.
An object that is on top will cover, either partially or fully depending on its size, all other objects beneath it. Meanwhile an object on the bottom of the stack may not be visible at all, as it is covered up by other objects. An object in the middle may be partially covered by other objects, while partially covering yet more objects itself.
You can send the selected object down or up a layer, or directly to the top or bottom of the stack.
Format Align Objects
In the submenu you can quickly align all the currently selected objects with a side of the slide, or center them either vertically or horizontally.
Ctrl; G Format
If you are drawing, you might want to make something out of several objects. Arrange the individual parts where you want them, select one, then hold down the & Ctrl; key as you click in the others you want to group together. Click Group Objects and from then on they act as if they are just one thing. It glues things together.
Ctrl; Shift; G Format
If you decide that you want to alter an object that is made out of several pieces, you can unglue it with this tool. Click somewhere away from the object to deselect it, then click to select one of its parts.
Format Shadow Objects...
This puts a colored copy of either text or a drawn object behind it. You can make nice dropped shadows for logos with this tool. To enable this item, ensure that you have object(s) selected (you will see the eight small squares around the outline.) You choose the color, select which way the shadow is going to fall and select a distance. For text it looks nice if you set the distance to two or three. Click Apply to see the result of your settings for all selected objects on the slide without leaving the dialog.
Format Page Layout...
Allows you to set the page details. You can specify the margins, the orientation, either portrait (higher than wide) or Landscape (wider than high) formats. There are many templates, such as screen, A4, US legal.
Format Enable/ Disable Document Header
Toggle the display of the header field on the current slide. Header content can only be added in the master slide but you can choose to display the header only on some slides with this action.
Format Enable/ Disable Document Footer
Toggle the display of the footer field on the current slide. Footer content can only be added in the master slide but you can choose to display the footer only on some slides with this action.
Format Slide Background...
Allows you to alter the background to your presentation slides. Your options are Color/ Gradient, (which lets you set either a plain color or one of many gradients) or Picture, which gives a dialog box to find the picture you want. Set the View mode: for this picture to Scaled, Centered, or Tiled.
If you want a plain color, click in the box to select it. Gradients only work when you have chosen two colors. The picture option allows you to center the picture, zoom it to cover the entire slide (if it is smaller than the screen, this is very useful) or tile it. This is used when you want a small pattern to repeat across the page. It's probably best used with patterns rather than pictures of logos.
You can get rid of a picture by selecting another one or choosing a color/ gradient.

Settings Toolbars
The items in this submenu can be toggled, that is, you can both enable and disable the display of specific toolbars here.
Settings Configure Autocorrection...
Autocorrection is & kpresenter; 's ability to correct common typing errors or expand abbreviations independently of the spell checking function. There are several common typing errors entered for you by default such as replacing teh with the and you can add as many more as you like.
The ability to expand abbreviations can save you a lot of typing time, if you often repeat text whether in the same presentation or in multiple presentations.
For instance, if you work for Company with a really really long name Inc. then you might define an autocorrection entry so that whenever you type myJob or some other piece of unique text, it will be replaced with Company with a really really long name Inc..
Autocorrection can be applied automatically as you type, or only on demand when you choose it from the Text menu.
Please see the Configure Autocorrection section for a complete explanation.
