Joystick This module helps to check if your joystick is working correctly. If it delivers wrong values for the axes, you can try to solve this with the calibration. This module tries to find all available joystick devices by checking / dev/ js[0-4] and / dev/ input/ js[0-4] If you have another device file, enter it in the combobox. The Buttons list shows the state of the buttons on your joystick, the Axes list shows the current value for all axes. NOTE: the current Linux device driver (Kernel 2.4, 2.6) can only autodetect 2-axis, 4-button joystick 3-axis, 4-button joystick 4-axis, 4-button joystick Saitek Cyborg'digital 'joysticks (For details you can check your Linux source/ Documentation/ input/ joystick. txt)
