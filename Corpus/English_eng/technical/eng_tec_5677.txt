Introduction
Gametype: Toy
Number of possible players: One
& ktuberling; a simple constructor game suitable for children and adults alike. The idea of the game is based around a once popular doll making concept. A potato was decorated with various small artifacts to make it look more like a tiny person. & ktuberling; however, goes much further in terms of content and adds a surprising variety of different themes.
How to Play
& ktuberling; is a game intended for small children. Of course, it may be suitable for adults who have remained young at heart.
It is a potato editor. That means that you can drag and drop eyes, mouths, mustache, and other parts of face and goodies onto a potato-like guy. Similarly, you have other playgrounds with different themes.
There is no winner for the game. The only purpose is to make the funniest faces you can.
There is a museum (like a Madame Tusseau gallery) where you can find many funny examples of decorated potatoes, penguins and aquariums. Of course, you can send your own creations to the programmer, Eric. Bischoff;, who will include them in the museum if he gets some spare time.
& ktuberling; can also speak. It will spell out the name of the objects you drag and drop. It will speak in a language that you can choose. You can even use it to learn a bit of vocabulary in foreign languages.
Rules and Tips

Main Window
Placing an Object
To drag an object, move the mouse pointer to the objects area and Click on it. Then move it to the playground area and click again.
Size of the objects may change while dragging. Some of the oversized objects have been scaled down to feet into the“ objects” area.
Moving an Object
Once dropped in the playground area, an object can be moved. Just click on the object to select it, move it to the new place and click again to drop it. When you drop it, it goes on top of other objects that were partially hiding it. This trick is useful for getting the glasses and eyes placed correctly.
Removing an Object
To remove an object that has been dropped in the playground area, drag it back from the playground area to the objects area.
