The include_once() statement includes and evaluates the specified file during the execution of the script.
This is a behavior similar to the include() This is a behavior similar to the include() statement, with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already been included, it will not be included again.
As the name suggests, it will be included just once.
include_once() should be used in cases where the same file might be included and evaluated more than once during a particular execution of a script, and you want to be sure that it is included exactly once to avoid problems with function redefinitions, variable value reassignments, etc.
For more examples on using require_once() and include_once(), look at the PEAR code included in the latest PHP source code distributions.
Note:
Be aware, that the behaviour of include_once() and require_once() may not be what you expect on a non case sensitive operating system (such as Windows).
Example 12-9. include_once() is case sensitive
include_once( "a.php"); / / this will include a.php include_once("A.php"); / / this will include a.php again on Windows!
Warning
Windows versions of PHP prior to PHP 4.3 do not support accessing remote files via this function, even if allow_url_fopen is enabled.
See also include(), require(), require_once(), get_required_files(), get_included_files(), readfile(), and virtual().
