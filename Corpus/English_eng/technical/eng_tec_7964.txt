EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
KOGENATE BAYER
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is KOGENATE Bayer?
KOGENATE Bayer is a powder and solvent that are mixed together to make a solution for injection.
KOGENATE Bayer contains the active substance octocog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor VIII).
What is KOGENATE Bayer used for?
KOGENATE Bayer is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).
KOGENATE Bayer is intended for either short-term or long-term use.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is KOGENATE Bayer used?
KOGENATE Bayer should be started by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of haemophilia.
KOGENATE Bayer is given by intravenous injection (into a vein) over several minutes, up to a rate of 2 ml per minute.
The dose and frequency depend on whether KOGENATE Bayer is used to treat haemorrhage (bleeding) or prevent it during surgery.
The dose is also adjusted depending on the severity of the haemorrhage or the type of surgery.
KOGENATE Bayer can also be given as a continuous infusion (drip into a vein) for at least seven days in patients undergoing major surgery.
Full details on how to calculate the doses are included in the Package Leaflet.
How does KOGENATE Bayer work?
The active substance in KOGENATE Bayer, octocog alfa, is a blood coagulation factor protein.
In the body, factor VIII is one of the substances (factors) involved in blood coagulation (clotting).
Patients with haemophilia A lack factor VIII, and this causes blood coagulation problems, such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.
KOGENATE Bayer is used to replace the missing factor VIII.
It corrects the factor VIII deficiency and gives temporary control of the bleeding disorder.
Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce human coagulation factor VIII.
How has KOGENATE Bayer been studied?
KOGENATE Bayer is similar to the medicine KOGENATE, but it is prepared differently so that there are no human-derived proteins in the medicine.
Because of this, the studies done with KOGENATE Bayer have been compared to KOGENATE to show that the two medicines are equivalent.

The main measure of effectiveness in the studies was the number of treatments required to stop each new bleed.
KOGENATE Bayer has also been studied as a continuous infusion in 15 patients with haemophilia A undergoing major surgery.
The main measure of effectiveness was the doctor’ s assessment of how well bleeding was stopped.
What benefit has KOGENATE Bayer shown during the studies?
In the previously treated patients, overall, 95% of bleeds responded to one or two intravenous injections of KOGENATE Bayer.
In the previously untreated patients, about 90% of bleeding episodes responded to treatment with one or two intravenous injections.
When given as a continuous infusion, stopping bleeding was assessed as ‘ excellent ’ in all 15 patients.
What is the risk associated with KOGENATE Bayer?
Haemophilia A patients may develop antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII.
An antibody is a protein produced by the body in reaction to unknown agents as part of the natural defence system of the body.
In clinical trials with KOGENATE Bayer, this happened in 14% of previously untreated patients and in 17% of children who had been treated for less than five days in the past.
However, it is seen in less than 0.2% of patients treated for more than 100 days.
If antibodies develop, KOGENATE Bayer will not work effectively.
Hypersensitivity (allergic reactions) has sometimes been seen in patients treated with factor VIII-containing products.
Other side effects seen in rare cases were dysgeusia (taste disturbances), nausea, reactions at the injection site, pyrexia (fever), allergic or anaphylactic (severe allergic) reactions, abnormal blood pressure, dizziness, pruritus (itching) and rash.
KOGENATE Bayer should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to recombinant coagulation factor VIII, to mouse or hamster protein or to any of the other ingredients.
Why has KOGENATE Bayer been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that KOGENATE Bayer’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).
The Committee recommended that KOGENATE Bayer be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about KOGENATE Bayer:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for KOGENATE Bayer on 4 August 2000.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 4 August 2005.
The marketing authorisation holder is Bayer HealthCare AG.
