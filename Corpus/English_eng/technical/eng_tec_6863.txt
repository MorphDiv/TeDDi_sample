component
In this module you can change & kde; default components.
Components are programs that handle basic tasks, like the terminal emulator, the text editor and the email client. Different & kde; applications sometimes need to invoke a console emulator, send a mail or display some text.
To do so consistently, these applications always call the same components. Here you can select which programs these components are.
The list on the left shows the configurable component types:
Email Client
Embedded Text Editor
File Manager
Instant Messenger
Terminal Emulator
Web Browser
Window Manager
Click the component you want to configure. In the right part of the dialog then all available applications for this service are displayed and you are able to select your favorite terminal emulator, text editor and the email client & etc;
