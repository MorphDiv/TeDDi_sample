(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
Returns 0 if str1 is less than str2; 0 if str1 is greater than str2, and 0 if they are equal. strcoll() uses the current locale for doing the comparisons.
If the current locale is C or POSIX, this function is equivalent to strcmp().
Note that this comparison is case sensitive, and unlike strcmp() this function is not binary safe.
See also ereg(), strcmp(), strcasecmp(), substr(), stristr(), strncasecmp(), strncmp(), strstr(), and setlocale().
