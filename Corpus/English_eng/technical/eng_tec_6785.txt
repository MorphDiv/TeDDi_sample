Tips on how to track your activities effectively.
How to track time
Your time tracking habits will be dictated by your reason for collecting the data. What is that you want to do with the data? Is it plain curiosity, or a work requirement? And at what level of detail are you interested in the results?
Granularity
A suggested pace is to have 5 to 30 activities per day.
The intention of
What should I write in each box?
For simple activities that don't have a project, use the action as the
For more sophisticated tracking try to caption your activity in one or two words ("tree house", "project x", or similar) and use that caption in the
This approach will alow you to see how much reading you have done through all your projects (by tag), how much time you have spent in your hobbies (by category), and how much time of all your work in project x you have spent analysing (by activity and tag)
Tips for improving your tracking data
Name activities so that they can be easily distinguished from each other. Activity name is also the only information that appears in the panel. Will you be able to determine what you are working on just by looking at the activity name?
Keep your list of categories small (say, 3 to 7) and pick ones that are unlikely to change over time. Also, keep them generic. For example: "work", "private", "misc".
Use the description field for short-term information like reference numbers. The search in the
Activities and tags can come and go as necessary. Once you think that you are done with an activity for good, remove it so that it doesn't pop up in the auto-complete any more. Don't worry: the facts (activities in the log) will not be deleted. This is just the "operational list".
Note on interpretation of statistics.

However, the "Starts and Ends" should give you some idea about your active time.

Report and export
Apart from the HTML format that is offered by default in the Save report dialog, the format drop-down allows you to choose TSV (Tab Separated Values, good for spreadsheets), XML, and iCal formats.
For programmatic access, there is D-Bus API, that can be introspected using tools like
The fastest way to get the data "out" of the Time Tracker is by generating a HTML report. While holding the
Automatic conflict solving.
Splitting activities

Merging can become handy when entering information for the whole day. Start by entering the first activity and select the "in progress" check box for the end time. For the next activity again set just the start time and mark it as ongoing. Observe how the end time of the previous activity gets adjusted to the start time of the new one. Repeat the process until happy!
Tricks to speed up activity entry.
Input
To start tracking, type in the activity name in the input box and hit the
Use the @ symbol to add a category
Everything after a comma (,) will be stored in the description field
To specify time on the fly, enter it first in the input box
A few examples:
12:30-12:45 watering flowers
Forgot to note the important act of watering flowers over lunch.
tomatoes@garden, digging holes
Need more tomatoes in the garden. Digging holes is purely informational, so added it as a description.
-7 existentialism, thinking about the vastness of the universe
Corrected information by informing application that I've been doing something else for the last seven minutes. Relative times only work for ongoing activities without an end time.
On top of that you can add tags in the tag input field. Tags are delimited by a comma. Press the
