The strategy to use for authentication.
The region for the authentication service.
Whether to pass through headers containing user and tenant information when making requests to the registry. This allows the registry to use the context middleware without the keystoneclients' auth_token middleware, removing calls to the keystone auth service. It is recommended that when using this option, secure communication between glance api and glance registry is ensured by means other than auth_token middleware.
