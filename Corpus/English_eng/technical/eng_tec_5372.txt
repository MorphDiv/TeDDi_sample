These functions allow you to access the mnoGoSearch (former UdmSearch) free search engine. mnoGoSearch is a full-featured search engine software for intranet and internet servers, distributed under the GNU license. mnoGoSearch has a number of unique features, which makes it appropriate for a wide range of applications from search within your site to a specialized search system such as cooking recipes or newspaper search, FTP archive search, news articles search, etc.
It offers full-text indexing and searching for HTML, PDF, and text documents. mnoGoSearch consists of two parts.
The first is an indexing mechanism (indexer).
The purpose of the indexer is to walk through HTTP, FTP, NEWS servers or local files, recursively grabbing all the documents and storing meta-data about that documents in a SQL database in a smart and effective manner.
After every document is referenced by its corresponding URL, meta-data is collected by the indexer for later use in a search process.
The search is performed via Web interface.
C, CGI, PHP and Perl search front ends are included.
More information about mnoGoSearch can be found at http: / /www.mnogosearch.ru /.
Note:
This extension is not available on Windows platforms.
Download mnoGosearch from http: / /www.mnogosearch.ru / and install it on your system.
You need at least version 3.1.10 of mnoGoSearch installed to use these functions.
In order to have these functions available, you must compile PHP with mnoGosearch support by using the --with-mnogosearch option.
If you use this option without specifying the path to mnoGosearch, PHP will look for mnoGosearch under / usr / local / mnogosearch path by default.
If you installed mnoGosearch at a different location you should specify it: --with-mnogosearch=DIR.
Note:
PHP contains built-in MySQL access library, which can be used to access MySQL.
It is known that mnoGoSearch is not compatible with this built-in library and can work only with generic MySQL libraries.
Thus, if you use mnoGoSearch with MySQL, during PHP configuration you have to indicate the directory of your MySQL installation, that was used during mnoGoSearch configuration, i.e. for example: --with-mnogosearch --with-mysql= / usr.
This extension has no configuration directives defined in php.ini.
The constants below are defined by this extension, and will only be available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.
