CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs.
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
As an aid in the management of overweight and obesity in adult dogs.
To be used as part of an overall weight management programme which also includes appropriate dietary changes.
Introducing appropriate lifestyle changes (e. g. increased exercise), in conjunction with this weight management programme, may provide additional benefits.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not use in dogs with impaired liver function.
Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Do not use in dogs during pregnancy and lactation.
Do not use in dogs less than 18 months of age.
Do not use in dogs in which overweight or obesity is caused by a concomitant systemic disease such as hypothyroidism or hyperadrenocorticism.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
2/ 20 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
The use in dogs for breeding purposes has not been evaluated.
If vomiting, significantly reduced appetite or diarrhoea repeatedly occurs, treatment should be interrupted and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Where treatment is interrupted due to vomiting, it is recommended that when treatment is resumed, the product should be administered after a meal.
In addition, treatment should be interrupted and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought where the observed body weight loss is severe and rapid.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-administration, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
If accidental eye contact occurs, flush immediately with copious amounts of water.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
A decreased appetite may occur during treatment.
This is related to the mode of action of the product and should not be considered as an adverse reaction unless it becomes very significant.
Vomiting, diarrhoea or softened stools may occur during treatment.
In most cases, these effects are mild and transient.
In case an adverse reaction repeatedly occurs or in case the dog stops eating for two consecutive days, treatment should be interrupted and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
In laboratory studies, decreases in serum albumin, globulin, total protein, calcium and alkaline phosphatase and increases in ALT and AST were detected following administration of the product at the recommended treatment dose.
In addition, hyperkalaemia was occasionally observed.
Generally, the severity of these effects increased with increasing dose.
Typically, these findings normalised, or appeared to be reversing, within two weeks following the end of treatment.
The following adverse reactions were observed during the clinical trials (pooled data*):
Clinical observation
Mitratapide
Placebo
vomiting: occasional (≤ 3x)
20.0%
5.6%
vomiting: repeated (> 3 x) diarrhoea / soft stools
10.0% 10.0%
2.2% 4.4%
anorexia / decreased appetite lethargy / weakness
17.8% 5.2%
10.0% 2.2%
* data from 360 dogs over the whole treatment period.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Do not use in dogs during pregnancy and lactation.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No drug interactions were observed in studies where Yarvitan was administered concomitantly with NSAIDs (carprofen, meloxicam) or ACE inhibitors (enalapril, benazepril).
Interactions with other drug types were not specifically investigated.
The absorption of lipid soluble drugs used concomitantly with mitratapide has not been investigated.
Therefore, for dogs receiving treatments in addition to the product, drug interactions should be monitored closely.
3/ 20 4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Administer orally once daily at 0.63 mg mitratapide/ kg bodyweight (1 ml of the product per 8 kg) given for 2 periods of 21 days with 14 days without treatment in between.
In order to allow proper dosing, the dog should be weighed on day 1 and on day 35 (i. e. at the start of each treatment period).
Treatment should be given with food.
Use the dosing pipette as provided with the product.
During the first 21 days of treatment, the quantity of food the animal receives may remain unchanged.
Thereafter, feeding should be in accordance with energy requirements for maintenance (to be calculated by the veterinarian).
This can be achieved either with a regular pet food or with a low calorie (diet) pet food.
In clinical trials, treated animals rapidly regained weight following cessation of treatment when diet was not restricted.
In order to avoid this rebound weight gain, it is necessary to continue the feeding for maintenance regimen after the end of treatment with the product.
Mitratapide therapy should be restricted to one treatment course for an individual dog.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
The following clinical signs were observed after 3 or 5 times overdosing in dogs: softened or liquid faeces, vomiting, salivation, anorexia, severe weight loss, emaciated appearance, dehydration and pale mucosae.
In case of accidental overdosing, symptomatic therapy should be administered.
No specific antidote is available.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Not applicable.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Peripherally acting antiobesity products, ATCvet Code:
QA08AB90
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Mitratapide is a potent inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP).
Administration of mitratapide to dogs results in reduced uptake of dietary lipids, dose dependent decreases in serum cholesterol and triglyceride and an increased presence of triglyceride containing droplets in enterocytes.
It is assumed that these effects are mediated by MTP inhibition at the level of the enterocyte.
This results in blockage of the uptake of dietary lipids.
Mitratapide also has a slight appetite decreasing effect, which is linked to its mode of action.
Accumulation of triglycerides inside the enterocytes may be followed by decreased appetite.
Mitratapide has no central effect.
In clinical trials, the following weight loss percentages were obtained:

*: in line with the recommended treatment schedule
4/ 20 5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Laboratory animals and dogs rapidly absorb orally administered mitratapide.
The most important metabolic transformation is sulphoxidation, which produces three active metabolites.
Following oral administration, the bioavailability of mitratapide (parent compound and metabolites) is in the range from 55 to 69%, the volume of distribution is approximately 5 l/ kg.
Mitratapide and its metabolites bind very extensively (> 99%) to plasma proteins and distribute to the tissues.
After multiple dosing, the highest concentrations are present in the adrenal glands, liver, jejunum and kidney, but there is no exposure in the brain, excluding any central effect of the product.
Excretion is rapid and mainly via the faeces.
In fed dogs, a single dose of 0.63 mg mitratapide/ kg bodyweight results in maximum concentrations of the parent substance in plasma of on average 0.012 µg/ ml attained 3.5 hours after dosing; the sulphoxide metabolites reach maximum concentration of on average 0.0136 µg/ ml and 0.0168 µg/ ml, respectively after 6.5 hours and 8.5 hours; the sulphone metabolite reaches 0.0092 µg/ ml after 17.5 hours.
At the end of a three week dosing period, mitratapide attains average steady-state concentrations of 0.0068 µg/ ml, the sulphoxide metabolites 0.0089 µg/ ml and 0.0167 µg/ ml, respectively, the sulphone 0.0471 µg/ ml.
The terminal plasma half-life is 6.3 hours for mitratapide, 9.8 hours and 11.7 hours for the sulphoxides, respectively, and 44.7 hours for the sulphone metabolite.
The pharmacokinetic parameters display variable dependency on dose and vary slightly between the first and the second three week treatment periods of a complete treatment schedule.
