(PHP 4 = 4.0.1)
The function sscanf() is the input analog of printf(). sscanf() reads from the string str and interprets it according to the specified format.
If only two parameters were passed to this function, the values parsed will be returned as an array.
Any whitespace in the format string matches any whitespace in the input string.
This means that even a tab in the format string can match a single space character in the input string.
Example 1. sscanf() Example
/ / getting the serial number $serial = sscanf( "SN / 2350001" ,"SN / %d"); / / and the date of manufacturing $mandate = "January 01 2000"; list($month, $day, $year) = sscanf($mandate ,"%s %d %d"); echo "Item $serial was manufactured on: $year -".substr($month,0,3) ."-$day\n";
Example 2. sscanf() - using optional parameters
/ / get author info and generate DocBook entry $auth = "24 Lewis Carroll"; $n = sscanf($auth ,"%d %s %s", $id, $first, $last); echo" author id='$id 'firstname $first / firstname surname $last / surname / author \n";
