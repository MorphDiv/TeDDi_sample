& ktimer; is an application for the & kde; environment that lets you start an application after a certain amount of time has passed.
KDE
kdeutils
ktimer
countdown
Introduction
& ktimer; allows you to enter several tasks and to set a timer for each of them. When the timer reaches zero, the task is executed. The timers for each task can be started, stopped, changed, or looped.
Using & ktimer;
Here's a screenshot of & ktimer; when you start it for the first time
& ktimer; main window
To start, first add a task by selecting New. Then type the command you wish to execute into the Command line: box. You can then adjust the settings, or start the timer countdown. When the time is up, the command will be run.
Here's a screenshot of & ktimer; after you have told it to run & konqueror;.
add a task
Let's use & konqueror; as an example. By default, it will start in 100 seconds once the timer countdown is started.
Here it is counting down: in 56 seconds & konqueror; will be run.
56 seconds to go
Now let's start the task. Here it has been running for a bit and is partway through the countdown. In 56 seconds, & konqueror; will be started.
See that sliding bar? You can use it to quickly increase or decrease the amount of time on a task.
Let's add a second task.
start another & konqueror;, you can never have too many!
Now two & konqueror; s are scheduled to be run. The top one will be run in 20 seconds, and the bottom one is currently stopped. You can add more commands. While you can never have too many & konqueror; s, you probably want to use other executables. Your own shell script, perhaps.
Settings

Adds a new task.
