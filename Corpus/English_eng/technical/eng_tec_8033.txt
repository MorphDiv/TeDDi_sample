EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
BENEFIX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is BeneFIX?
BeneFIX is a powder and solvent that are mixed together for injection.
BeneFIX contains the active ingredient nonacog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor IX, which helps blood to clot).
What is BeneFIX used for?
BeneFIX is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor IX).
BenFIX can be used in adults and children over the age of 6.
BeneFIX is intended for either short-term or long-term use.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is BeneFIX used?
BeneFIX should be started by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of haemophilia.
BeneFIX is given by a slow infusion into a vein (usually up to 4 ml per minute).
BeneFix should not be mixed with other infusions solutions or be given using another giving set that the set supplied with the medicine.
The dose depends on whether BeneFIX is used to treat haemorrhage (bleeding) or to prevent it during surgery.
The dose is also adjusted depending on the severity of the haemorrhage or the type of surgery.
It is generally administered once a day, except in life threatening situations.
The full detail on how to calculate the doses is included in the Package Leaflet.
How does BeneFIX work?
BeneFIX contains nonacog alfa.
Nonacog alfa is a blood coagulation factor protein.
In the body, Factor IX is one of the substances (factors) involved in blood coagulation (clotting).
Patients with haemophilia B lack Factor IX, and this causes blood coagulation problems, such as bleeding in the joints, muscle or internal organs.
BeneFIX is used to replace the missing factor IX, it corrects the factor IX deficiency and gives temporary control of the bleeding disorder.
Nonacog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce human coagulation factor IX.
How has BeneFIX been studied?
BeneFIX has been studied in previously treated patients with moderate or severe haemophilia B, as a prevention treatment (prophylaxis), or during and after surgery.
It has also been studied in patients who have not received any treatment for their haemophilia.
The studies assessed the number of 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail@emea. eu. int http: / /www. emea. eu. int ©EMEA 2006 Reproduction and/ or distribution of this document is authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged bleeding episodes that occurred and rated BeneFIX’ s effectiveness using a four-point scale (“ excellent ”, “ good”, “ moderate”, and “ no response”).
What benefit has BeneFIX shown during the studies?
In previously treated patients, of the 693 haemorrhages treated, 566 (82%) resolved after a single infusion of BeneFIX.
Out of 972 infusions, 815 (84%) infusions were rated to have “ good” or “ excellent” responses.
What is the risk associated with BeneFIX?
Haemophilia B patients may develop antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If this happens, BeneFIX will not work effectively. Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been seen sometimes in patients treated with factor IX containing products..
For the full list of all the side effects reported with BeneFIX, please see the Package Leaflet.
BeneFIX should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to recombinant coagulation factor IX or to any of the other ingredients or to hamster proteins.
Why has BeneFIX been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that BeneFIX’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
They recommended that BeneFIX be given marketing authorisation.
BeneFIX has been authorised under "Exceptional Circumstances", because it has not been possible yet to obtain complete information on the medicine.
Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) reviews any new information that may have become available and updates this summary as necessary.
What information is still awaited for BeneFIX?
The company that makes BeneFIX will keep a register of all new patients who are treated with BeneFIX in Europe; they will also study the medicine in previously-treated patients in greater details, and carry out a study in children under the age of 6.
Other information about BeneFIX:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for BeneFIX to Wyeth Europa Ltd. on 27 August 1997.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 27 August 2002.
