Configuration options
General settings
Number of columns to show
Folders are automatically distributed in several columns. The optimal number of columns depends on the width of the konqueror window and the number of bookmarks you have.
Show folder backgrounds
Disable it on slow system to disable background images.
Bookmarks
Show bookmarks without folder
If this option is unchecked, bookmarks at the root of the hierarchy (not in a folder) are not displayed. If checked, they are gathered in a "root" folder.
Flatten bookmarks tree
Sub-folders are shown within their parent by default. If you activate this option, sub-folders are displayed on their own. It looks less nice but it may help if you have a very big folder you want to spread in two columns.
Show system places
Show a box with KDE places (Home, Network,...). Useful if you use konqueror as a file manager.
Pixmap cache
Disk cache size
Specify how much disk space is used to cache the pixmaps.
Clear Cache
Remove all cached images. This may be necessary if some favicons become corrupt and do n't refresh automatically.
