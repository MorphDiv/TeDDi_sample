Getting Started
This is a short introduction to & kuser;. For more detailed information, see Usage.
Actually, you do not need to do anything to begin using & kuser; except configuration.
When you have made the changes you want, you must Save them for them to take effect. Either choose the Toolbar icon, or use the File menu.
Usage
Main Window
& kuser; is a very simple application. In the main window you can see two tabs: the list of users and the list of groups. To edit a user or a group, just double click on it. The user or group properties dialog will appear.

User Properties Dialog
The user properties dialog has various tabs.
The number of tabs depends on the type of the user storage system and whether quotas are being used. Additional tabs will appear if you have shadow passwords, or any other similar things such as / etc/ master. passwd in BSD flavor Unices.
User Info Tab
In the User Info tab you can modify:
User Id
Full Name
Login Shell (the list of login shells is taken from the / etc/ shells file)
Home Folder
Two office locations
Address
Password
Password Management Tab
The Password Management tab will appear if you have shadow passwords, or any other similar things such as / etc/ master. passwd in BSD flavor Unices.
In the Extended Info tab you can modify parameters related to extended account control:
Minimum number of days between password changes
Number of days after which a password expires if it has n't been changed
Number of days before expiration the user will be warned
Whether and when an account will be disabled if the password expires
A set date when the account expires
Class (on BSD systems)
The date of the last password change is displayed near the top of the dialog.
Quota Tab
You will probably see the Quota tab only if you have at least one mounted volume with quota enabled and a quota file present. There you may modify all quota related parameters:
File Soft Quota
File Hard Quota
File Time Limit (Grace Period)
iNode Soft Quota
iNode Hard Quota
iNode Time Limit (Grace Period)
All these parameters can be changed for each file system that has user quota enabled. File systems can be changed using the Quota Filesystem box.
Groups Tab
The Groups tab contains all the information about the selected user's participation in groups. The primary group to which the user belongs is set in the Primary Group box. The user can be assigned to additional groups by checking them in the large box.
Group Properties
The Group Properties dialog contains a list of all users. Check the boxes for each user to be assigned to the selected group.
Adding, Editing and Deleting Users or Groups
To add a user or group to the system, either choose Add from the User or Group menu, or click the relevant Add button on the toolbar. The selected user or group can also be edited or deleted in the same way.
Customizing & kuser;
Edit user creation defaults
To edit the user creation defaults you can use the Edit defaults dialog, which is accessible via the menu Settings Configure & kuser;. There you may change the defaults that are used when creating a new user: Shell and Home Folder (or home folders volume). You can choose whether to make a home folder on create or not, and to copy a skeleton (standard configuration files) to the home folder or not. You can also enable User Private Group mechanism, which creates a new personal group with the creation of a new user, and removes the personal group when the user is removed.
The skeleton files for new users can be specified in the Sources tab.
