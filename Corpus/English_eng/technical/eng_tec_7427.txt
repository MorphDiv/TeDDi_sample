2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
One dose of 0.5ml contains:
Active substance:
Inactivated whole avian influenza virus antigen of H5N2 subtype (strain A/ duck/ Potsdam/ 1402/ 86), inducing an HI titre of ≥ 6.0 log2 as tested according to the potency test.

For a full list of excipients see section 6.1
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Emulsion for injection
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Chickens
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
For active immunisation of chickens against avian influenza type A, subtype H5.
Efficacy has been evaluated on the basis of preliminary results in chickens.
Reduction of clinical signs, mortality and excretion of virus after challenge were shown by three weeks after vaccination.
Serum antibodies could be expected to persist for at least 12 months after administration of two doses of vaccine.
4.3 Contraindications
Do not administer intramuscularly in chickens less than 2 weeks old.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
This vaccine has been tested for safety in chickens.
If used in other avian species that are considered at risk of infection, its use in these species should be undertaken with care and it is advisable to test the vaccine on a small number of birds prior to mass vaccination.
The level of efficacy for other species may differ from that observed in chickens.
The level of efficacy attained may vary depending on the degree of antigenic homology between the vaccine strain and circulating field strains.
2 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
None
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
To the user:
This product contains mineral oil.
Accidental injection/ self injection may result in severe pain and swelling, particularly if injected into a joint or finger, and in rare cases could result in the loss of the affected finger if prompt medical attention is not given.
If you are accidentally injected with this product, seek prompt medical advice even if only a very small amount is injected and take the package leaflet with you.
If pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination, seek medical advice again.
To the physician:
This product contains mineral oil.
Even if small amounts have been injected, accidental injection with this product can cause intense swelling, which may, for example, result in ischaemic necrosis and even the loss of a digit.
Expert, PROMPT, surgical attention is required and may necessitate early incision and irrigation of the injected area, especially where there is involvement of finger pulp or tendon.
4.6 Adverse Reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Safety has been assessed on the basis of preliminary results in chickens.
A transient diffuse swelling may occur at the vaccination site in 50% of the animals, which persists for about 14 days.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
No information is available on the safety of this vaccine for birds in lay.
4.8 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy from the concurrent use of this vaccine with any other.
It is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered within 14 days before or after vaccination with the product.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For subcutaneous or intramuscular use.
Allow the vaccine to reach a temperature of 15°C - 25°C and shake well before use.
Use sterile syringes and needles.
It is recommended to use a closed multiject vaccination system.
From 8-14 days old:
0.25 ml subcutaneously From 14 days to 6 weeks old:
0.25 or 0.5 ml subcutaneously or intramuscularly 6 weeks and older:
0.5 ml subcutaneously or intramuscularly Future laying hens and breeders should get a second vaccination 4-6 weeks after first vaccination.
No information is available on vaccination in the presence of maternally derived antibodies.
Immunisation of progeny from vaccinated birds should therefore be delayed until such antibodies have declined.
3 4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Following the administration of a double dose no adverse reactions other than those described in section 4.6 have been observed.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Zero days.
5.
IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group: inactivated vaccine, ATC-vet code:
QI01AA23
The vaccine stimulates active immunity against Avian Influenza virus type A, subtype H5.
If the circulating avian influenza field virus has a different N component to the N2 included in the vaccine, it may be possible to differentiate between vaccinated and infected birds by using a diagnostic test to detect Neuraminidase antibodies.
