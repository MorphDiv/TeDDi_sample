The Mailbox List
The mailbox list in the main window lists all of your mailboxes.
Your mailboxes will be displayed as a tree view, with mailboxes in subdirectories of your local mail directory initially hidden but accessible by expanding the tree.
The Message Index
The message index displays the messages in the current folder, and lets you choose which messages to view. Click on the notebook tabs, if shown, or click on a folder in the mailbox list to bring it to the front.
From the message index you can do a lot. Clicking on a message will cause it to be displayed in the message view. Right-clicking on it will give a pop-up menu letting you reply to the message (or forward it, etc.) and move it to another folder (using the
The pop-up (context) menu contains the following items:


The Message View
This displays the email that is selected in the message index. Message headers are displayed above the main text of the message, unless they have been disabled. The text of the message is shown below the headers.
If the message is multipart, an attachment icon will appear beside the headers. Clicking this icon will display a list of the parts from which you may select one. If

Using



The following options determine the protocol used for signing and/or encrypting the message. You should choose the appropriate protocol which all recipients can use.



Cryptographic signatures and encryption are available only when
The toolbar contains buttons for the most commonly used functions when sending messages, including Send, Attach File..., and Save. As with the menu bar, some buttons are disabled if the message is not correctly setup to be sent.
Send
Send the current message. Only available if the message is legal to be sent (i.e. proper email addresses). This button may also be configured to queue the message in the outbox to be sent later (see the
Attach
Open a dialog to attach a file to the current message.
Postpone
Postpone the message to the Draftbox for later revision and sending.
Check Spelling
Start a spell check on the current message. If
Print
Print out the draft of the message.
Cancel
Close the composition window without saving or sending the message within.
Headers
The headers area is where the information regarding where the message is being sent to and from, as well as comments and keywords can be entered. All of the available headers are not shown by default, but they can be turned on and off very quickly using the menu.

Below the headers may be a large box displaying a list of attachments; this view can be toggled in the
When there are attachments displayed, it is possible to right-click on one of them to access an option menu.
Message Body
Finally, below the attachment list is the main area of the window where the text of the message is displayed. The text editing capabilities are very basic, but it supports cut, copy, and paste so it is possible to write a message in your favorite editor and simply paste it in.
If the message is a reply or forward, the referenced message will be displayed in the body text widget, with the prefix specified in the
Spell Checker
Once the spell check has been started, it will take a moment to load the text and spell checking module, and then it will automatically begin checking the message. If it finds any words that are incorrect, the word will be highlighted and a panel will be shown that offers a number of suggestions and available courses of action.
Spell Checking Panel
As shown above, the panel consists of a list of two panes, one the left containing a list of suggestions and an entry box, while the right contains several buttons to choose your action. The list on the left is re-generated for each incorrect word, with all the suggestions the spell check program comes up with. You can choose what program you want to use through loadable modules, selectable in the
The buttons on the left control the actions to take for each incorrect word. The buttons include:
Change
Change the incorrect word with the currently selected suggested word or the user's edited word.
Change All
Change all occurances of the current incorrect word with the currently selected suggestion.
Ignore
Ignore the current incorrect word and continue to the next one.
Ignore All
Ignore all occurrances of the current word, and continue to the next incorrect word.
Learn
Add the current incorrect word to your personal dictionary. This will cause it to be considered correct for all future spell checks.
Done
Stop the spell check at the current point, keeping all changes so far and returning to the normal message window interface.
Stop the spell check at the current point, reverting all changes so far, including any words added to your personal dictionary.
Address Book
When composing a message, clicking on any of the colored book icons next to a destination field (To, Cc, Bcc) will bring up the
Address Book Window
The address book provides two panes, the one on the left consisting of all available addresses, while the one on the right contains the intended recipients of your message. Addresses are added to the recipient list by selecting them in the left pane and clicking the arrow button pointing to the right, or by simply double-clicking on the address. This will remove the address from the left pane, so they cannot be added more than once. If you decide that you no longer want to send the message to a particular address, simply select it in the right-hand pane and click the left-arrow button, or double-click it again, to move it back.
If, while selecting people to send your message to, you decide to add someone new to the address book, it is a simple matter to click on the

Reflow messages of type `text/plain;format=flowed'
The `format' parameter distinguishes two ways of representing paragraphs in messages of type `text/plain' (that is, simple text). The value `flowed' indicates that paragraphs have been broken into lines ended with `soft' line breaks: a space is left at the end of the line. A `hard' line break (one that is not preceded by a space) indicates the end of a paragraph.

The only other value of `format' is `fixed', which is the value assumed by default when `format' is not specified, as with older mailers. In this case, all line breaks must be respected. If you do not select the `Reflow...' option,

If this option is selected, messages that are `Automatically quoted' will actually be attached unmodified, instead of included in the text of the reply, prefixed by the reply string.

Pspell Module
The Pspell library allows you to use whatever spell checking engine you prefer, though the use of loadable modules. Currently Pspell has support for two modules, the traditional ispell, and the newer and more advanced aspell.


Suggestion Mode
The suggestion mode determines how hard the computer will search for suggestions for misspelled words. There are three options:
Fast
This mode quickly scans for replacements, which means it might be used by a good speller who occasionally makes typographical errors.
Normal
The Normal mode is probably good enough for most people; it should produce the correct suggestion in the majority of cases.
Bad Spellers
The Bad Spellers mode is the most thorough and accurate mode; however, it also takes the longest to find a list of suggestions.
Ignore Length
This provides the ability to ignore words shorter than a certain length. It may be useful to automatically skip short acronyms that are normally flagged as incorrect.

IMAP Folder configuration
The folder configuration edit dialog allows you to configure entire mailbox sets on remote IMAP servers. Entire configuration is split into basic and advanced parts.
Basic IMAP folder configuration
The basic IMAP folder configuration tab is probably the only part you need to fill in.
Descriptive name is the name of the root node that will be shown in the mailbox tree on the left side.
Server is the host name or IP number of the IMAP server.
User name is the name used for authorization on the IMAP server.
Some servers allow anonymous access to bulletin boards or mailing list archives. Check this box if you want to use this mode - you will not be asked for password.
Password is the password used for authorization on the IMAP server.
Check box allows you to choose all mailboxes on the server, or only those you subscribed to.
Prefix is the root mailbox on the server. You may leave it empty if you want to show all the folders on your server but if your IMAP server stores also other kind of files you may specify for instance "mail".
Advanced IMAP folder configuration
Sometimes, it is necessary to tune the folder configuration in order to assure a secure connection, adjust to server limits or just obtain better performance. This functionality is provided by the Advanced IMAP folder configuration tab.

Writing your own save scripts
Adding addresses is also possible. Your script should receive 3 arguments. The first is an email address, the second a full name and the third is an alias (currently not used and replaced by 'TODO').
Note that mutt does not have support for adding addresses and there is thus no compatibility in this case.
