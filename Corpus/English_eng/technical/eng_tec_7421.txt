CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Cattle (lactating dairy cows)
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
For the treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating cows due to Gram-positive cocci susceptible to pirlimycin including staphylococcal organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, both penicillinase-positive and penicillinase-negative, and coagulase-negative staphylococci; streptococcal organisms including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis.
4.3 Contraindications
Resistance against pirlimycin.
Treatment of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli.
Do not treat cows with palpable udder changes due to chronic subclinical mastitis.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Susceptibility testing of the target bacteria should be carried out prior to treatment.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Avoid contact with the solution.
Wash hands and any exposed skin with soap and water and remove contaminated clothing immediately after use.
Flush eyes with water for 15 minutes immediately after exposure.
Hold eyelids open to ensure complete contact with water.
2 4.
6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
None known
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The product is indicated for use in lactating dairy cows and can be used during pregnancy.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Cross-resistance may occur between pirlimycin and other lincosamides or macrolides.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Administration: by intramammary infusion only.
Infuse one syringe (50 mg pirlimycin) into each infected quarter.
Treatment consists of eight infusions of one syringe every 24 hours.
Care must be taken not to introduce pathogens into the teat in order to reduce the risk of E. coli infections.
Ensure adequate cleansing of the teat (and udder - if needed) before infusion.
The following instructions should therefore be followed carefully.
Clean hands before handling the cow's udder.
Wash the udder if it is dirty.
Where necessary, wash teats thoroughly with warm water containing a suitable dairy cleansing agent and dry them thoroughly.
Disinfect teat end using a suitable cleansing agent.
The teat end should be cleaned until no more dirt appears on the swab.
Use a separate disinfectant towelette for each teat.
Do not touch cleaned teat ends before administering the infusion substance.
Insertion:
Remove the white end cap by pulling straight up.
Gently insert the cannula into the teat canal; carefully infuse the product.
Push plunger with continuous pressure gently and slowly to dispense entire contents into the gland and massage the quarter to distribute the product into the milk cistern.
Following infusion, dip all teats with a disinfectant teat dip.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
No data on overdosing are available.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Meat and offal:
23 days.
Milk:
5 days.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antibacterial for intramammary use ATCvet code:
QJ51FF90
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pirlimycin hydrochloride is a semi-synthetic lincosamide antibiotic.
The lincosamides (clindamycin, lincomycin, and pirlimycin) inhibit protein synthesis in Gram-positive and in anaerobic bacteria as well as in Mycoplasma spp.
They work by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, therefore hindering the aminoacyl-tRNA binding and inhibiting the peptidyltransferase reaction, which interferes with protein synthesis within the bacteria.
3 Gram-positive isolates with an MIC > 2 µg/ ml are to be considered resistant.
Enteric bacteria such as E. coli are intrinsically resistant to pirlimycin.
Pirlimycin has a basic pKa (8.5).
This means it will be more active in an acid environment and tends to concentrate, relative to plasma, in areas with lower pH, such as abscesses.
Pirlimycin has been shown to accumulate in polymorphonuclear cells, however, intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus was not demonstrated.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
After intramammary infusion, mean parent concentrations in milk were 10.3 µg/ ml at 12 hours and 0.77 µg/ ml at 24 hours.
Similar concentrations were reached at 12 and 24 hours after a second infusion at a 24 hour interval.
Of the dose infused, 10-13% is excreted in the urine, and 24-30% via the faeces; the remainder is excreted in the milk.
