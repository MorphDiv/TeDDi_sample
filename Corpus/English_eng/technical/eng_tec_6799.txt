Introduction
& kopete;, the & kde; instant messaging client
Before starting...
If you're not familiar with Instant Messaging, please read the Getting Started section to learn about this wonderful world before continuing.
What is & kopete;?
& kopete; is the & kde; instant messaging (im;) client. It allows you to communicate with your friends and colleagues using various instant messaging services. A single program is easy to learn and convenient if your friends or colleagues use more than one & im; service.
& kopete; is designed to integrate well with your & kde; desktop; to make it immediately familiar. The user interface is clean and simple, without any frills to distract the user. At the same time, & kopete; aims to make communication the focus of & im;, by removing the differences between different & im; systems. One feature & kopete; introduced to support this is the Metacontact, combining the various means there are to contact someone into a single person in your contact list. Other multiprotocol instant messengers list the same person's various & im; accounts separately, making it confusing for non experienced people. & kopete; makes life easy: a metacontact is a person, and contacts are ways to communicate with that person. You will recognize contacts in a metacontact easily as small icons representing the & im; services you could use to communicate with that person.
& kopete; is intended for all levels of users. Out of the box, it supports a minimal set of functions to make chatting as easy as possible. More advanced users can add extra functions such as Statistics with & kopete; 's plugin system.
More & kopete; Information on the Web
For more info about the & kopete; project; the team maintains a website at & kopetewww;. The latest news and updates are always available there.
If you need to contact the team, the & kopete; developers' mailing list is hosted at https: / /mail. kde. org/ mailman/ listinfo/ kopete-devel.
If you want live support, there is an Internet Relay Chat channel for & kopete; where you can find the team discussing technical (well, not always) issues or just hanging out. You can use any IRC client to join the channel (including & kopete;), just add an IRC contact and use irc. kde. org as the server and #kopete as the channel name. See you there!
Introduction to Instant Messaging
What is Instant Messaging (im;)? & im; is a way for you to communicate instantly with your friends over the Internet. That might not sound so different to email. Have you ever noticed how cumbersome it is to have a brief conversation via email? You have to click Reply to each message, then find the right spot in the message to type something new, then send it. Then you have to wait for the next message to arrive! & im; lets you to have a conversation almost as naturally as on the phone or face to face, by typing messages into a window shared between you and your friend's screens.
Another difference between & im; and email is that with & im; you can see your friends' presence, that is, whether they are actually on-line at the same time as you. This lets you send messages truly instantly, instead of sending off a mail and having to wait for your friend to check their mailbox. An & im; message pops up on the other person's screen as soon as you send it. Of course, if you'd rather not be interrupted, you can change your own presence so others will know not to disturb you.
There are lots of other fun and useful & im; features you can explore with & kopete;, like group chats, file transfers and emoticons that reflect your mood. Read on to find out more!
Getting Started
To use & kopete; you need to set up one or more accounts for the instant messaging services you wish to use.
You've probably already chosen a messaging service, either because you already use & im;, or you need to use the same service as your friends. If you do n't fit into either of these categories, please consider using a messaging service based on open standards, because these are designed for use by Free Software. Other messaging services are prone to changing the underlying technology without making the details freely available, making them harder for Free Software developers to support.
The messaging services that & kopete; supports that are based on open standards are Jabber and IRC.
The following section assumes you are registered with an & im; service already. If not, you can register with Gadu-Gadu, Jabber, and MSN from inside & kopete;; for other services, you'll have to register using their respective web site before creating an account in & kopete;.
Creating Accounts
To create an account, use Settings Configure... to display the Configure window.
The Configure window is the main way to set up and customize & kopete;. On the left a column of icons control which aspect of & kopete; is being configured. Click the Accounts icon. The main pane will change to display the account management pane. This is currently empty, but will soon list your & im; accounts. Click New to display the Account Wizard.
The Account Wizard helps you create an & im; account. After the Introduction page, you are asked to select the messaging service that you'd like to use. Click one of the services shown and then click Next. On the following page, you should enter your registration details for that instant messaging service.
Most services just require you to enter a username or unique identifying number (UIN) and password. The special purpose services Winpopup and SMS work slightly differently, so please see their specific sections. There are a couple of other options that apply to most services that you should look at:
Remember password
When this is checked, & kopete; will store the password for you, so you do n't have to enter it every time you connect to the & im; service. If you are security-conscious or want to limit access to the & im; account you can leave this unchecked.
Connect at startup
When this is checked, & kopete; will try to connect to the & im; service as when it starts. If you use a LAN, DSL or other always-on connection, this is appropriate; dial-up modem users should turn this off and connect manually when you have dialed up.
Once you've entered your & im; details, you can proceed to the Finished! page and then dismiss the wizard and the Configure window.
Go Online and Start Chatting!
Now you'll notice that an icon representing the account has appeared in the status bar at the bottom of the & kopete; Contact List window. This represents your current presence for this account. Right click on it and you can go online from the menu that appears. The status bar icon will animate while & kopete; connects to the & im; service.
Once you're online, if you've used this & im; service before, your contacts will be fetched from the server and displayed in the Contact List. To start a chat with a contact, just click their name and a Chat window will appear. The upper part of the window is where the conversation appears - to say something, type into the bottom part of the window and click Send.
If you've just created a new account you wo n't have any contacts. See Adding Contacts for details on how to add contacts.
The shortcut for Send is set to Ctrl; Enter; by default; you can change it in the Chat window using Settings Configure Shortcuts....
Using & kopete;
This chapter gives an overview of & kopete; 's basic features. We will look first at the contact list, where your contacts are displayed, and then at the Chat window, where you carry out a conversation.
The Contact List
The Contact List appears when you start & kopete;. It's the main window where you can set your presence, start a chat, organize your contacts, configure & kopete; and quit.
Layout of the Contact List window
Menu
You will usually find the menubar at the top of the contact list. If it is not there, you might have turned it off; you can re-enable it with Ctrl; M. Details on each menu item can be found in the chapter on menu structure.
Tool bar
The toolbar holds the most frequently used & kopete; actions. You can customize it with Settings Configure Toolbars.... Notice the Show Offline Users and Show Empty Groups buttons. With these you can hide contacts and groups that are offline.
& kopete; makes it even easier to set a status message to let your contacts know about your mood or why you're busy at the moment. Click on the Set Status Message button and start typing to enter a new message, or choose from one of the previous messages you have used.
The Quick Search Toolbar quickly filters the contact list, by typing a few letters from a contact's name.
Contact List
The Contact List takes up the main part of the window. All your contacts are listed here, in the groups you have chosen for them. You can open or close groups by clicking the plus symbol adjacent to the group. You can reverse the order the groups are sorted in by clicking the Contacts label above the list.
The context menu in the Contact List changes depending on the item under the mouse. Groups, Metacontacts and & im; system specific contacts have their own options. In empty areas of the Contact List, the context menu allows you to add contacts or groups, or change the viewing options for the list.
Status bar
The status bar shows an icon for each & im; account you have created. The icons represent the current presence of each account, which can be changed by right -clicking the account icon.
& kopete; also shows your current status message in the Status Bar >. By clicking on the note icon in the corner, you can change or clear the status message as well.
Setting Your Presence
We introduced you to setting presence in the previous chapter. 'Presence 'determines how visible you are on the & im; network. To use the network at all, you have to connect to the network, so you can send and receive messages and see others' presence. Once you are connected, most & im; systems allow you to indicate what you're doing and whether you want to chat by setting special types of presence such as Away or Free For Chat. The difference presence settings are particular to each away system; but & kopete; allows you some control all your & im; systems at once by setting them to Away or Available at the same time.
You set your presence for individual & im; accounts by right clicking the account's icon in the status bar at the bottom of the Contact List. The context menu for each account lets you choose the possible presence settings for each & im; system.
To change all your accounts' presence together, click the Status, or use the File Status menu.
Start A Chat From The Contact List
To start a chat from the Contact List, simply click a contact. A Chat window will appear.
You can also right click a contact and select either Send Message or Start Chat. Send Message works differently in that it just sends a single message without opening the Chat window, using a simple dialog. Use it for fire-and-forget messages.
Send A File
You can send files from the Contact List, using the context menu on the person you want to send to. If & kopete; supports file transfer on their & im; system, there will be a Send File... item. Alternatively, you can drag a file from anywhere else in & kde; onto their name to start a file transfer.
Organizing Contacts
A Word about Metacontacts
One of the principles behind & kopete; is that it offers a standardized way to use & im; systems. Differences between & im; systems are smoothed over, making it easier to communicate. We follow this principle in the way contacts are organized. When you use & kopete; you just find contacts by name; the actual & im; system used is less important. Some people have more than one & im; account - & kopete; puts the person using the account first.
To support this, & kopete; introduced Metacontacts, which represent the person you want to chat with. One Metacontact contains all the different & im; IDs they may have, making it easy to see with a glance at the Metacontact'smiley icon 'whether someone is available, regardless of which & im; system they are using right now.
A Word about Grouping Contacts
& kopete; lets you create groups to sort your contacts. A contact may be in more than one group. Where possible, groupings are saved on server side contact lists, so if you use other & im; programs, group memberships are kept in sync. However, if you change groups in another & im; program, & kopete; cannot know to move a metacontact automatically; it is up to you to resolve this by hand.
To change the group a metacontact appears in, you can use its context menu to move it or copy it to a new group, or remove it from a group. You can also use drag and drop here - just drop the metacontact on a different group name.
Adding Contacts
To add a contact, either select File Add Contact or click the Add button on the toolbar. This brings up the Add Contact Wizard.
The Add Contact Wizard creates a new Metacontact using one or more & im; systems, by leading you through the following pages.
Welcome Page. Here you can choose whether you want to use the & kde; Address Book for this contact. Storing & im; information in the & kde; Address Book will enable other & kde; & im; programs to share contact information with & kopete; and in future & kde; applications may use & kopete; to send information via & im;. If you prefer to keep your & im; contacts separated, clear the check box here.
Choose & kde; Address Book entry. By choosing an entry from your & kde; Address Book, you can use its name as a Display Name in & kopete;. You can also create a new entry here. This page does n't show if you chose not to use the & kde; Address Book.
Select Display Name and Group. Here you can enter a Display Name (the name used for this person inside & kopete;), and choose the groups they are a member of.
Select & im; Accounts. Here you can choose which accounts you want to use to chat to the new contact. If you only have one & im; account, you wo n't see this screen.
Account-specific Add Contact Pages. For each account, you'll get one page where you can enter the UIN, buddy name or Email address, depending on the & im; system in use.
Finish Screen. All done. Except if the & im; system requires authorization (such as ICQ) to add a contact to your list - in which case, you'll be prompted after the wizard exits.
You can add contacts to an existing Metacontact using its context menu.
Renaming Contacts
You can rename a contact using Edit Rename Contact or with the same item on the metacontact context menu.
Some & im; systems allow you to set a Display Name that is different to your username, such as Alice loves crypto!. If you change a contact's name manually, this will override their Display Name. To get it back, open the Properties dialog for that contact and check the Use the name given by the server checkbox.
Removing Contacts
If you no longer want a contact to be in the contact list, you can remove a Metacontact and all the contacts under it with Metacontact context menu Remove Contact.
Moving Contacts between Metacontacts
You can change the metacontact a contact belongs to. In practice, you only have to do this when you have just added multiple accounts to & kopete;, and you know that HotDog76 and mikejones@hotmail. com are both the same person.
There are two ways to do this:
Drag and Drop
The contact icon to the right of the metacontact name may be dragged from one metacontact to another.
Contact Context Menu
The context menu for contacts (Right -click the contact icon) allows you to choose the new metacontact from a dialog.
If the move would leave a Metacontact empty (with no contacts), you'll be asked if you want to delete this contact.
Removing Contacts from Metacontacts
To remove a contact from a Metacontact, choose Contact context menu Delete Contact....
Configure & kopete;
You can configure & kopete; using Settings Configure.... See the next chapter for details.
Exiting & kopete;
To exit & kopete; you should use File Quit, Ctrl; Q, or the & kopete; System Tray icon's context menu. If you just close the Contact List window, & kopete; will continue to run in the & kde; System Tray.
Keyboard shortcuts
The following keyboard shortcuts are supported in the Contact List window:

The Chat Window
Layout of the Chat Window
The Chat View
The Chat View usually takes up most of the Chat window and is where the conversation between you and your contacts takes place. Messages appear in the order they are received, with the earliest messages at the top of the view.
You can control the appearance of the Chat View, making it look like other & im; clients or create a completely individual look.
Chat Members List
Since some & im; systems allow you to chat as a group, it is useful to see who is chatting at the moment. The Chat Members List appears to the left or the right of the Chat View. You can change this using Settings Chat Members List. The contact context menu is available in the Chat Members List.
Input Area
The Input Area is below the Chat View. This is where you type messages before sending them. You can change the font and color of the message using the usual tools on the toolbar. If the & im; system supports this, your messages will appear in color when your contacts read them.
By default, the keyboard shortcut to send messages is & Enter;.
Status Bar
The Status Bar contains temporary messages, such as notification that someone else is typing, as well as the Send button.
Tabbing
& kopete; lets you carry on multiple conversations in one window, by putting each one in its own tab within the window. The tab titles change color to show when a new message has been received:
Red
Someone typed a message.
Green
Someone is typing a message.
Blue
Someone typed a message containing your nickname.
There are several different ways to control grouping. To configure this behavior, go to the Chat tab of the Behavior page of the Configure & kopete; dialog. You can also move chats between windows using the Tabs menu, and control the placement of the tabs in the window.
Group Chats in & kopete;
You can use & kopete; to chat one to one, or in a group, where the & im; system supports this.
To invite others into a chat, drag them from the Contact List into the chat window, or use Chat Invite lt; contact namegt;.
File Transfers
Some & im; systems allow you to send and receive files. You can access this function from the contact's context menu. If you're already chatting, and want to send a file, simply drag the file from any other part of & kde; into the Chat Window, or select the Chat Send File menu.
Keyboard Shortcuts
The following keyboard shortcuts are supported in the Chat window:
& Enter;
Send the message in the Input Area.
& Ctrl; P
Print the contents of the Chat View.
& Ctrl; S
Save the contents of the Chat View.
& Ctrl; W
Close the current Chat View. The Chat window will close unless there is more than one tab in the window.
& Ctrl;,
Change to the previous tab.
& Ctrl;.
Change to the next tab.
& Ctrl; Shift; B
Detach a tabbed chat into a separate window.
Tab
Complete a partially typed nickname belonging to someone you're chatting with.
Configuring & kopete;
To configure & kopete;, look in the Settings menu.
Global Shortcuts
& kopete; defines some shortcuts which are valid in any & kde; application.
Global Keyboard Shortcuts
& Ctrl; Shift; I
Read Message. This is useful if you have hidden the Contact List window and the system tray icon is animating to tell you you have a new message.
& Ctrl; Shift; C
Show/ hide (Dock) the Contact List window. Warning: If you have disabled & kopete; 's System Tray icon or do n't have a system tray, this can make the Contact List vanish - the only way to restore it is to repeat this shortcut.
The Configure & kopete; Dialog
Adding and Editing Accounts
We briefly showed you how to add an account in Getting Started. To change an account's settings later, open up the Configure & kopete; dialog, with Settings Configure.... Much like the & kde; Control Center, the configuration is separated into sections. The icons on the left side of the dialog switch between sections.
On the Accounts page, you can Add, Remove, or Modify accounts. Editing accounts is much the same as adding them, but note that you cannot change the UIN, buddy name, or whatever account identifier your & im; system uses. This is intrinsic to the account. If you want to change this, you will have to add another account with the new account identifier and (optionally) remove the old account.
You can quickly distinguish between multiple accounts using the same & im; system by giving a custom color to each account's status bar entry and contact icons. To do so, select the account and click the color selector on the right side of the page.
You can control the priority of accounts using the Up and Down icons on this page. If you have more than one way to message a contact, this determines the & im; system & kopete; will use to communicate them.
Global Identity
& kopete; 's Global Identity lets you set your own nickname and photo once for all your & im; accounts. You can read these details from the & kde; address book entry for yourself, from a single one of your contacts, or add a completely new nickname or photo. If you have an exciting dual life, you can create multiple identities and switch between them in the Identity section.
Behavior
Behavior covers the way & kopete; integrates with your desktop, Away settings, and chat user interface options.
The General tab
Here you can customize & kopete; 's desktop integration, and control the way the contact list is laid out.
Show system tray icon
By default, & kopete; places an icon in the & kde; System Tray. If you prefer, you can turn this off here.
Start with hidden main window
This causes & kopete; to start with the Contact List window hidden (docked). You can make it visible by clicking the system tray icon or with the Show Contact List global shortcut.
Open messages instantly
New messages open chat windows as soon as they arrive.
Use message queue
The message queue is where & kopete; puts messages when there is no chat window open. This allows you to be notified of new messages with popup speech bubbles; or by animating the System Tray icon. If you choose to disable the message queue, chat windows will open as soon as you receive a new message.
Use message stack
If you use a message stack, & kopete; shows recently received messages starting with the last message received.
Notifications
Show a bubble on new message
This option shows a speech bubble; coming from the System Tray icon when you receive a new message. You can start a chat or ignore the message. & URL; s are extracted from the message; if you click a link, your preferred browser will open the link and the message will be dismissed.
Flash the system tray on new messages
This option causes the System Tray icon to animate when you receive a new message. Clicking the icon will show the message in a chat window.
Enable events while away
If you do not wish to be distracted by these notifications while you are set Away, uncheck this box.
Configure Sounds & Events
Sounds, flashing taskbar entries, passive popups and more exotic notifications are supported in & kopete; using the & kde; notification system. Type help: / kcontrol/ kcmnotify in & konqueror; or select the Help tab in the System Notifications section of the & kcontrolcenter; for more information.
To add custom notifications for a contact, right click that contact in the Contact List and select Properties. This lets you start chats, play a custom sound effect, or display a message for that contact or group. Otherwise you can use the Execute a program notification to perform custom notifications. As an example, if you have XOSD (X On-Screen Display) installed, you can get OSD online notifications by executing the following command when the User goes online event takes place:
echo %s | osd_cat -o 100 -p bottom -A center -f -*-helvetica-*-r-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-* -O 2 -c gold
OhReally at the & kde; Forum suggests having your online notifications read out by a speech synthesizer, using MBROLA like so:
echo %s | sed -e's/ online/ onlaain/ i '| / usr/ local/ bin/ mbrdico. dutch. female
The'sed 'in the middle phoneticises & kopete; 's output to so the synthesizer has a better Dutch pronunciation.
Away Settings
Notify all open chats when I go away
Be careful if you enable this item; it will cause a message to be sent to open chats when you become away, which some people may find intrusive.
Auto Away
Here you can choose to have & kopete; set you away after a period of inactivity.
Predefined Away Messages
You can define as many custom away messages as you like here, and choose from them when you go Away using the Status button on the main toolbar.
Chat Settings
Raise window/ tab on new messages
This causes a chat window to pop up when it receives a new message.
Show events in chat window
Some & im; systems can give extra information, like people joining or leaving chats. This option lets you receive these messages in your chat window.
Highlight messages containing your nickname
This simply emphasizes messages in a chat that contain your nickname. For more powerful control over highlighting and other events, see the Highlight plugin.
Interface Preference
& kopete; can send messages using either a fire and forget interface that does not wait for a reply, or a chat window where the conversation is visible as it unfolds. Here you can choose which style to use by default.
Chat Window Grouping Policy
If you wish to group chats within tabs in a single window, & kopete; lets you choose several ways to determine the grouping.
Open all messages in a new chat window
Group all messages from the same account in the same chat window
Group all messages in the same chat window
Group all messages in the same group in the same chat window
Group all messages from the same metacontact in the same chat window
Chat Window Line Limit
Maximum number of chat window lines
This limits the number of lines of text the chat window can display.
Appearance
Appearance governs the style of the Chat window, its colors and fonts, and lets you choose your preferred emoticons.
Emoticons
Emoticons (also known as smileys) are combinations of characters such as; -) that look like a face, and communicate moods or expressions. & kopete; can optionally use graphical emoticons in place of the characters themselves.
On this tab, you can select which emoticon set you prefer, or turn off graphical emoticons altogether.
See Specialized Actions for details of how to install extra emoticon sets.
Chat Window
Styles
The style of the chat view can be altered to look like other clients. Installed styles are shown in the list on the left and are previewed in the main panel. See Chat Window Style guide for a document how to make your own style.
Third party styles are available at http: / /kde-look. org. & kopete; 0.12 now supports styles from Adium(an & im; program on & Mac; OS X). So you can download styles from Adium here: Adium Xtras and select Message View Styles.
To install a style, click Install.... Select an archive file containing the style. To delete a style, select a style in the list and click Delete.
Group consecutive messages is a useful option to make your chats more readable. If you receive several messages in a row from the same contact, they are grouped without repeating the sender name.
Arrange metacontacts by group
By disabling this, & kopete; 's groups are hidden, and contacts are divided only into Online Contacts and Offline Contacts.
Show tree branch lines
Usually & kopete; displays contacts and groups as a tree, where group members are indented. For a simpler appearance, you can disable this, so the contact list becomes a flat list. You can also control whether branches are indented here.
Contact Display Mode
There are several ways you can present the contact list here. Of particular interest may be the Use contact photos when available option, that shows the contact list using photos chosen by your contacts or the & kde; Address Book
Contact List Animations
This controls the degree of animation of the contact list. Turning this off will make & kopete; more responsive on slower machines.
Contact List Auto-Hide
By enabling this, the contact list will automatically disappear a few seconds after the pointer leaves the window.
Change Tooltip Contents...
You have a lot of control over how much or how little detail appears in the tooltips shown on the contact list using this dialog.
Colors and Fonts
Chat Window Colors
Here you can alter the base font and text colors used for chatting.
Formatting Overrides
If your contacts tend to choose fonts and colors that you dislike, you can tell & kopete; to ignore these and use your regular font.
Some & im; systems let you see whether contacts are idle at their computers. This option enables you to change the color used for idle contacts.
Devices
The Devices section allows you to choose and configure which multimedia devices are used for A/ V chatting. Whether this works for you is highly dependent on the hardware you have and how well it is supported by your operating system.
Video
& kopete; uses the Video4Linux 2 system for video. This shows a blue square if no video device is found, or a preview if the camera is working. For up-to-date information on & kopete; webcam support, see the Kopete Webcam Support wiki page.
Audio
Audio support in & kopete; is at an experimental stage. If you have an Audio tab, you are probably using a preview build of & kopete;.
Loading Plugins
You can customize & kopete; with special functions that may be useful or just a bit of fun. Bring up the Configure Plugins dialog with Settings Configure Plugins....
Plugins can be turned on or off in the list on the left side of the page. Each plugin may be configured on the right side. See the chapter on plugins for details on each plugin.
& kopete; 's Protocols
& kopete; calls different & im; systems'Protocols'. When you add an account, it is specific to a single protocol. Although & kopete; tries to make instant messaging appear the same, no matter what protocol you use, there are some differences in the level of support for advanced features such as file transfer and multimedia.
Protocols
AIM
AIM supports chatrooms. Use the Join Chat... command on the AIM account menu to join a chatroom. Contact pictures and custom emoticons are also supported.
ICQ
ICQ has an Invisibility feature which allows you to hide from selected contacts. You may also search the ICQ user folder when adding a contact. A wide range of contact details can be set using the Properties option.
MSN
MSN supports the sending and receiving of webcams, if your camera is supported by the Video4Linux 2 (v4l2) standard. To view someones webcam, right click on their MSN butterfly icon and select View Contact's Webcam. File transfer and multi user chats work. To transfer a file, drag the file from & konqueror; or the desktop into the chat window. To invite someone else into a chat, drag them from the Contact List into the chat window. The File menu also contains these commands. In addition, MSN supports custom emoticons.
To use file transfer or a webcam, make sure port 6891 is forwarded to your computer.
Yahoo
Yahoo can send and receive webcam video. It also supports Yahoo mail and the Yahoo address book from the account menu. Conferencing is also possible.
Jabber
Jabber, also known as XMPP, supports file transfer, conferencing and any other services supplied by the Jabber server. For example, many Jabber servers have a user directory, and some provide transports to other messaging systems. To access services, use Services... on the account menu. Jabber file transfer can work without port forwarding, but enjoys better performance where a direct connection is possible. By default, port 8010 is used for port forwarding, but this is configurable in each account's settings.
Google Talk
Since Google Talk is based upon Jabber, it is well supported in & kopete; with the exception of voice chat, which is worked upon.
To configure & kopete; for Google Talk: Use your complete Google Mail address as the user name. Check Use protocol encryption (SSL), Allow plain-text password authentication and Override default server information. The server is talk. google. com or gmail. com and ports 443 or 5223 should be used.
Novell GroupWise
GroupWise Messenger is an enterprise messenging system from Novell Inc. The full range of features are supported, including privacy, group chat, rich text and user search.
Gadu-Gadu
Gadu-Gadu is a chat system originating from Poland. At present, & kopete; supports basic chat functions.
WinPopup
WinPopup is a way to use & kopete; to send and receive messages with & Windows; computers on the local network. The WinPopup protocol only supports single, plain-text messages.
Other protocols
As well as the protocols named above, & kopete; has support for several other protocols. In most cases, this is not enabled by default or an additional plugin must be installed. Meanwhile, SMS, Skype and SILC are provided in this way. See & kopetewww; for details, however, the & kopete; team are not responsible for these protocols.
& kopete; 's Plugins
& kopete; offers plugins that provide functions that are n't essential for messaging, but are useful for some people.
Plugins
Alias
Alias lets you define your own commands, & eg; / hello, in & kopete; that run scripts and output the result in the chat window. If you know how the alias Unix command works, this is just the same
Auto Replace
Auto Replace allows you to correct frequently misspelled words or save typing certain words using abbreviations.
Bookmarks
The Bookmarks plugin creates bookmarks in your & kde; bookmarks list from URLs that are received in & im; messages.
Connection Status
Connection Status is useful for modem users or others who do n't have a permanent Internet connection. It watches for an active Internet connection and sets your accounts online when it detects you have dialed up.
Contact Notes
Contact Notes allows you to note down any useful bits of information on a metacontact.
Highlight
Highlight works a little like email filters, in that it allows you to make things happen in response to particular messages. As well as highlighting the text, you can play sounds.
History
The History plugin, when activated, records conversations using any & im; system and allows you to view old conversations later. A History item appears in each Metacontact's context menu so you can view the message history for that metacontact.
The following item is added to the Contact List's menus:
Edit View History
(Enabled when a contact is selected) This displays the History browser for the selected contact.
The following items are added to the Chat window's menus:
Alt; Shift; Left Arrow Tools History Previous
This enables you to view the next oldest set of messages from the History in the Chat window.
Alt; Shift; Right Arrow Tools History Next
This shows the next newest set of messages from the History in the Chat window.
Tools History Last
This shows the most recent set of messages from the History in the Chat window.
OTR
The OTR plugin allows you to encrypt conversations using the Off-The-Record encryption method. This encryption method basically works like the PGP encryption but it is optimized for instant messaging and handles the key exchange on its own. The only thing you have to do, is to make sure that you really are writing to the person you expect by using one of OTR's authentication mechanisms.
Menu items
Edit OTR Policy
(Enabled when a contact is selected) You can set the encryption policy for each contact here. Setting this entry to "Default" causes & kopete; to use the default setting in the configure dialog
Tools OTR Settings Start OTR session
This lets you initiate an OTR encrypted session.
Tools OTR Settings End OTR session
This lets you end a previously established OTR session.
Tools OTR Settings Authenticate contact
Use this menu entry if you wish to authenticate the contact.
The settings dialog
In the setting dialog you have various options to set the modules behaviour during your chatsessions. The most important of them is the default policy configuration. Set the policy to "Opportunistic" if you wish & kopete; to check if you contacts support OTR and establish an encrypted session on its own or to "Manual" if you wish to control each encryption state on your own. The options "Always" and "Never" are recommended only for experienced users that wish to set the policy on a per-contact base. In the "Private Keys" Pane you have the possibility to create you personal keypair for each account. You do n't need to do this manually. If an account does not have a keypair it will be generated automatically the first time it is required. In the "Known Fingerprints" tab you have the possibility to see, verify and delete known public fingerprints of your contacts.
Authentication
You've probably received email from people pretending to be banks, credit agencies, even wealthy Nigerian expatriates. People lie about who they are all the time on the Internet. Authentication is a way to make sure that nobody can lie to you about who they are when they use OTR.
When to authenticate
You should authenticate a buddy the very first time that you talk to them using OTR. If you do n't, then you cannot really be sure that someone else is n't impersonating them or trying to listen in on your conversation. However, once you've authenticated your buddy once, you do n't have to do it again. OTR will automatically do the authentication for all of your future conversations with that buddy.
The only exceptions occur when your buddy switches between multiple computers or multiple & im; accounts. In this case, you will need to authenticate once for each computer and account. Once you've done this, your buddy can freely use any of the computers you've authenticated them on, and OTR will recognize them automatically. If your buddy uses a new computer or account that OTR does not recognize, a message will pop up in your conversation window telling you about it.
When to authenticate
How to authenticate
To authenticate someone, open a conversation with them and click on "Authenticate Contact" on the OTR button. A wizard will be shown, asking you what authentication method you would like to use. Please follow the steps in this wizard.
If the authentication was successful, then you know that you are really talking to your friend. Any imposter should have a hard time guessing what you're typing in, so you'll be able to catch them in the act.
KopeteTeX
KopeteTeX allows scientists and mathematicians to hold conversations using the LaTeX markup language. Expressions entered within $$are rendered as a graphic in the chatwindow, and can be cut and pasted as the original Latex. To use this plugin you must have LaTeX installed
Motion Auto-Away
In conjunction with a webcam and the Video4Linux package, this lets you detect when you're no longer at your computer and have & kopete; automatically become Away.
Now Listening
With the Now Listening plugin, let people you're chatting with know what you're listening to, by typing / media in a chat, or with Tools Send Media Info in the Chat window.
Statistics
This plugin uses a database to gather information about your contacts' activity patterns. You can use this to see when a contact is usually online, for example.
Text Effect
Text Effect applies funny effects to your messages before sending them, like coloring them or changing the case of the words. Just do n't forget you have activated it - we've had bug reports from forgetful Text Effect users!
Translator
The Translator plugin lets you define a preferred language for each Metacontact, and then translates messages to or from them using web based translation services such as Google and Babelfish. Set your own preferred language in the Configure Plugins dialog. Each contact's preferred language can be set on its context menu.
The following item is added to the Chat window's menus:
Ctrl; T Tools Translate
If you did not turn on automatic translation, this translates the current chat.
Web Presence
Web Presence allows you to publicize your & im; presence on the Web. Give it the path to a file on an & FTP; server (for example), and it will upload a short piece of & HTML; to that file, which you can include in your homepage. & kde; 's network transparency makes this simple. Useful for bloggers to make friends with, or you could use it to use & im; in your business.
Example: sftp: / /username@somehost. org/ path/ to/ homes/ user/ im. html uses the SFTP protocol to upload your presence directly onto the webserver.
See the KIO manuals for tips on specific network protocols.
Pipes
Pipes allows you to pipe incoming or outgoing messages through an external script or executable. An incoming message will be piped through the executable before it reaches your chat window, while outgoing messages will be piped through the executable before they are sent over the Internet. Pipes can receive text in one of three forms: Plain text body The body of the message, in plain & ascii; text html; text body The body of the message, in & html;, as it would be if your chat peer had sent & html; to you, which will be rendered in the chat window xml; full message An & xml; document that describes all the characteristics of the message, including the & html; body. For most purposes, you probably want to use the plain text body or & html; text body options. These can be used with programs such as translators or summarizers. The & xml; format is only appropriate for use with a program or script written specifically to work with this plugin. If you would like to write a program or script that does work with this plugin, see the more detailed documentation.

Frequently Asked Questions
What does & kopete; mean? How do I pronounce it?
& kopete; 's name comes from the chilean word Copete, meaning a drink with your friends. Duncan, the original author, recorded an audio sample.
When I have more than one messaging service under a user's name in my contact list and I click on that user's name, it will message them on the wrong messaging service.
You can change the order of accounts & kopete; tries to message people with by using the Up and Down arrows in the bottom right corner of the account configuration screen. & kopete; will try to connect with accounts starting from the top. However, if one service has a higher status value than the others for that user, & kopete; will use that one. For example, if a person has three services and two are marked as away and the third is marked as online, & kopete; will always try to message the user using the online service.
If you click on the small protocol icon on the right of the menu item, instead of on the person's name, you will always try to contact the person using that service!
I need to connect via a SOCKS proxy, but I cannot find any proxy configuration options in & kopete;. How do I set up & kopete; to use SOCKS?
MSN, ICQ, AIM, Jabber, and Yahoo use the & kde; network infrastructure. Their SOCKS proxy details are configured with the rest of & kde;, in Control Center, Internet & Network Proxy.
Is it possible to customize the icons I see in & kopete;?
You can switch between different emoticons using the Emoticons tab of the Appearance page of the Configure & kopete; dialog.
To install new emoticons, first look at KDE-Look. org, where there are a lot of additional emoticon sets to download.
The emoticons are easy to install - you just place a folder containing the icon files along with an & XML; file describing the mapping from text to picture in $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ kopete/ pics/ emoticons (or $KDEHOME, for example, in / home/ joeuser/. kde/).
Copy the extracted folder to $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ kopete/ pics/ emoticons or $HOME/. kde/ share/ apps/ kopete/ pics/ emoticons (or wherever $KDEHOME is)
Select Configure & kopete; from the Settings menu and click on Appearance in the left panel of the Preferences window and click on the Emoticons tab
Select the emoticons set you just installed from the list
Now you can use the newly installed emoticons in & kopete;
To replace the protocol icons, you'll have to replace the icons in $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ kopete/ icons, or provide replacements to override them in the same folder under $KDEHOME. At present there are n't any complete replacement sets that you can simply extract there.
