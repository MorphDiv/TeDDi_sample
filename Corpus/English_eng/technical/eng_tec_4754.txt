Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
After the socket socket has been created using socket_create() and bound to a name with socket_bind(), it may be told to listen for incoming connections on socket.
A maximum of backlog A maximum of backlog incoming connections will be queued for processing.
If a connection request arrives with the queue full the client may receive an error with an indication of ECONNREFUSED, or, if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request may be ignored so that retries may succeed.
Note:
The maximum number passed to the backlog parameter highly depends on the underlying platform.
On linux, it is silently truncated to SOMAXCONN.
On win32, if passed SOMAXCONN, the underlying service provider responsible for the socket will set the backlog to a maximum reasonable value.
There is no standard provision to find out the actual backlog value on this platform.
socket_listen() is applicable only to sockets of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
The error code can be retrieved with socket_last_error().
This code may be passed to socket_strerror() to get a textual explanation of the error.
See also socket_accept(), socket_bind(), socket_connect(), socket_create() and socket_strerror().
