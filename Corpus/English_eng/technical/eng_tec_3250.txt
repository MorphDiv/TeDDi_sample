(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
Sets the format of timestamp, date or time type columns returned from queries.
Internally, the columns are formatted by c-function strftime(), so refer to it's documentation regarding to the format of the string. columntype is one of the constants IBASE_TIMESTAMP, IBASE_DATE and IBASE_TIME.
If omitted, defaults to IBASE_TIMESTAMP for backwards compatibility.
?php / / InterBase 6 TIME-type columns will be returned in / / the form '05 hours 37 minutes'. ibase_timefmt("%H hours %M minutes", IBASE_TIME);?
You can also set defaults for these formats with PHP configuration directives ibase.timestampformat, ibase.dateformat and ibase.timeformat.
It has any meaning only with InterBase version 6 and higher.
Note:
A backwards incompatible change happened in PHP 4.0 when PHP configuration directive ibase.timeformat was renamed to ibase.timestampformat and directives ibase.dateformat and ibase.timeformat were added, so that the names would match better their functionality.
