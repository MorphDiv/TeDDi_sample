(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
pg_fetch_assoc() returns an associative array that corresponds to the fetched row (tuples / records).
It returns FALSE, if there are no more rows.
pg_fetch_assoc() is an extended version of pg_fetch_row().
In addition to storing the data in the numeric indices (field index) to the result array, it also stores the data in associative indices (field name) by default.
row is row (record) number to be retrieved.
First row is 0.
pg_fetch_assoc() is NOT significantly slower than using pg_fetch_row(), while it provides a significant ease of use.
See also pg_fetch_row(), pg_fetch_array(), pg_fetch_assoc(), pg_fetch_object() and pg_fetch_result().
Example 1.
PostgreSQL fetch array
?php $conn = pg_pconnect ("dbname=publisher"); if (!$conn) {echo "An error occured.\n"; exit;} $result = pg_query ($conn, "SELECT * FROM authors"); if (!$result) {echo "An error occured.\n"; exit;} $arr = pg_fetch_assoc ($result, 1, PGSQL_ASSOC); echo $arr["author"]. "- array\n";?
