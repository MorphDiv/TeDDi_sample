(PHP 4 = 4.0.2)
pspell_new_personal() opens up a new dictionary with a personal wordlist and returns the dictionary link identifier for use in other pspell functions.
The wordlist can be modified and saved with pspell_save_wordlist(), if desired.
However, the replacement pairs are not saved.
In order to save replacement pairs, you should create a config using pspell_config_create(), set the personal wordlist file with pspell_config_personal(), set the file for replacement pairs with pspell_config_repl(), and open a new dictionary with pspell_new_config().
The personal parameter specifies the file where words added to the personal list will be stored.
It should be an absolute filename beginning with '/' because otherwise it will be relative to $HOME, which is "/ root" for most systems, and is probably not what you want.
The language parameter is the language code which consists of the two letter ISO 639 language code and an optional two letter ISO 3166 country code after a dash or underscore.
The spelling parameter is the requested spelling for languages with more than one spelling such as English.
Known values are 'american', 'british', and'canadian'.
The jargon parameter contains extra information to distinguish two different words lists that have the same language and spelling parameters.
The encoding parameter is the encoding that words are expected to be in.
Valid values are 'utf-8', 'iso8859-*', 'koi8-r', 'viscii', 'cp1252', 'machine unsigned 16', 'machine unsigned 32'.
This parameter is largely untested, so be careful when using.
The mode parameter is the mode in which spellchecker will work.
There are several modes available:
PSPELL_FAST - Fast mode (least number of suggestions)
PSPELL_NORMAL - Normal mode (more suggestions)
PSPELL_BAD_SPELLERS - Slow mode (a lot of suggestions)
PSPELL_RUN_TOGETHER PSPELL_RUN_TOGETHER - Consider run-together words as legal compounds.
That is, "thecat" will be a legal compound, athough there should be a space between the two words.
Changing this setting only affects the results returned by pspell_check(); pspell_suggest() will still return suggestions.
For more information and examples, check out inline manual pspell website: http: / /aspell.net /.
Example 1. pspell_new_personal()
$pspell_link = pspell_new_personal ("/ var / dictionaries / custom.pws", "en", "","", "", PSPELL_FAST|PSPELL_RUN_TOGETHER));
