Batch Image-Color Processing
Batch image-color enhancement
A Kipi plugin for batch image-color enhancement. This plugin use the "convert" program from the "ImageMagick" package.
Image Coloring Options
Filter:
Decrease Contrast
Depth
Equalize
Fuzz
Gray Scales
Increase Contrast
Monochrome
Negate
Normalize
Segment
Trim
Select here the color enhancement type for your images: Decrease contrast: reduce the image contrast. The algorithm reduces the intensity difference between the lighter and darker elements of the image. Depth: change the color depth of the image. Equalize: perform histogram equalization to the image. Fuzz: merging colors within a distance, i. e. consider them to be equal. Gray scales: convert color images to grayscale images. Increase contrast: enhance the image contrast. The algorithm enhances the intensity differences between the lighter and darker elements of the image. Monochrome: transform the image to black and white. Negate: replace every pixel with its complementary color. The red, green, and blue intensities of an image are negated. White becomes black, yellow becomes blue, etc. Normalize: transform image to span the full range of color values. This is a contrast enhancement technique. The algorithm enhances the contrast of a colored image by adjusting the pixels color to span the entire range of colors available. Segment: segment an image by analyzing the histograms of the color components and identifying units that are homogeneous with the fuzzy c-means technique. Trim: trim an image (fuzz reverse technique). The algorithm remove edges that are the background color from the image.
Color Options
Depth value:
Select here the image depth in bits.
Distance:
Select here the fuzz distance in absolute intensity units.
Cluster threshold:
Select here the value which represents the minimum number of pixels contained in a hexahedron before it can be considered valid.
Smooth threshold:
Select here the value which eliminates noise in the second derivative of the histogram. As the value is increased, you can expect a smoother second derivative.
Batch Convert Images
Batch convert images
A Kipi plugin for batch converting images. This plugin uses the "convert" program from the "ImageMagick" package.
Image Conversion Options
Format:
Select here the target image file format.
JPEG: The Joint Photographic Experts Group's file format is a good Web file format but it uses lossy data compression. PNG: the Portable Network Graphics format is an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many common uses of TIFF. PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive display option. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms.
TIFF: the Tag Image File Format is a rather old standard that is still very popular today. It is a highly flexible and platform-independent format which is supported by numerous image processing applications and virtually all prepress software on the market.
PPM: the Portable Pixel Map file format is used as an intermediate format for storing color bitmap information. PPM files may be either binary or ASCII and store pixel values up to 24 bits in size. This format generates the largest-sized text files to encode images without losing quality.
BMP: the BitMaP file format is a popular image format from Win32 environment. It efficiently stores mapped or unmapped RGB graphics data with pixels 1-, 4-, 8-, or 24-bits in size. Data may be stored raw or compressed using a 4-bit or 8-bit RLE data compression algorithm. BMP is an excellent choice for a simple bitmap format which supports a wide range of RGB image data.
TGA: the TarGA image file format is one of the most widely used bitmap file formats for storage of 24 and 32 bits truecolor images. TGA supports colormaps, alpha channel, gamma value, postage stamp image, textual information, and developer-definable data.
EPS: the Adobe Encapsulated PostScript image file format is a PostScript language program describing the appearance of a single page. Usually, the purpose of the EPS file is to be embedded inside another PostScript language page description.
None

Batch Image Effects
Batch image effects
A Kipi plugin for batch image-effect transformations. This plugin uses the "convert" program from the "ImageMagick" package.
Image Effect Options
Effect:
Adaptive Threshold
Charcoal
Detect Edges
Emboss
Implode
Paint
Shade Light
Solarize
Spread
Swirl
Wave
Select here the effect type for your images: Adaptive threshold: perform local adaptive thresholding. The algorithm selects an individual threshold for each pixel based on the range of intensity values in its local neighborhood. This allows for thresholding of an image whose global intensity histogram does not contain distinctive peaks. Charcoal: simulate a charcoal drawing. Detect edges: detect edges within an image. Emboss: returns a grayscale image with a three-dimensional effect. The algorithm convolves the image with a Gaussian operator of the given radius and standard deviation. Implode: implode image pixels about the center. Paint: applies a special effect filter that simulates an oil painting. Shade light: shines a distant light on an image to create a three-dimensional effect. Solarize: negate all pixels above the threshold level. This algorithm produces a solarization effect seen when exposing a photographic film to light during the development process. Spread: this is a special-effect method that randomly displaces each pixel in a block defined by the radius parameter. Swirl: swirls the pixels about the center of the image. Wave: creates a "ripple" effect in the image by shifting the pixels vertically along a sine wave.
Effect Options
Width:
Select here the value which represents the width of the local neighborhood.
Height:
Select here the value which represents the height of the local neighborhood.
Offset:
Select here the value which represents the mean offset.
Radius:
Select here the value which represents the radius of the pixel neighborhood.
Deviation:
Select here the value which represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian, in pixels.
Select here the value which represents the radius of the pixel neighborhood. Radius defines the radius of the convolution filter. If you use a radius of 0 the algorithm selects a suitable radius.
Select here the value which represents the radius of the pixel neighborhood. For reasonable results, radius should be larger than deviation. If you use a radius of 0 the algorithm selects a suitable radius.
Factor:
Select here the value which represents the extent of the implosion.
Select here the value which represents the radius of the circular neighborhood. Each pixel is replaced by the most frequent color occurring in a circular region defined by the radius.
Azimuth:
Select here the value which represents the azimuth of the light source direction. The azimuth is measured in degrees above the x axis.
Elevation:
Select here the value which represents the elevation of the light source direction. The elevation is measured in pixels above the Z axis.
Select here the value which represents the percent-threshold of the solarize intensity.
Select here the value which represents the random pixel in a neighborhood of this extent.
Degrees:
Select here the value which represents the tightness of the swirling effect. You get a more dramatic effect as the degrees move from 1 to 360.
Amplitude:
Select here the value which represents the amplitude of the sine wave.
Length:
Select here the value which represents the wave length of the sine wave.

Laplacian
Poisson
Filter Options
Select here the algorithm method which will used to add random noise to the images.
Noise algorithm:
px
Select here the blur radius of the Gaussian, not counting the center pixel. For reasonable results, the radius should be larger than deviation. If you use a radius of 0 the blur operation selects a suitable radius.
Select here the standard deviation of the blur Gaussian.
Select here the median radius of the pixel neighborhood. The algorithm applies a digital filter that improves the quality of noisy images. Each pixel is replaced by the median in a set of neighboring pixels as defined by the radius.
Select here the noise reduction radius value. The algorithm smooths the contours of an image while still preserving edge information. The algorithm works by replacing each pixel with its neighbor closest in value. A neighbor is defined by the radius. If you use a radius of 0 the algorithm selects a suitable radius.
Select here the radius of the sharpen Gaussian, not counting the center pixel. For reasonable results, the radius should be larger than deviation. If you use a radius of 0 the sharpen operation selects a suitable radius.
Select here the sharpen deviation value of the Laplacian.
Select here the radius of the unsharpen Gaussian, not counting the center pixel. The algorithm convolve the image with a Gaussian operator of the given radius and standard deviation. For reasonable results, radius should be larger than sigma. If you use a radius of 0 the algorithm selects a suitable radius.
Select here the unsharpen deviation value of the Gaussian.
%
Select here the percentage difference between original and blurred image which should be added to original.
Amount:
Select here the unsharpen threshold value, as a percentage of the maximum color component value, needed to apply the difference amount.
