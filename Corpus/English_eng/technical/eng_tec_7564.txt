Kerberos Network Authentication Dialog
Kerberos Authentication allows you to list your current Kerberos tickets, and to request a new ticket (authenticate to the Kerberos Server). It also notifies you when your Kerberos credentials are about to expire and renews your ticket automatically if possible.
This is useful if you need to authenticate to a Kerberos Server (KDC) after your login to the desktop (e.g. on a mobile device).
