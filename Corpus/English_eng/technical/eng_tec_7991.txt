EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
MACUGEN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) on the basis of the studies performed, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
What is Macugen?
Macugen is a solution for intraocular injection (injection into the eye).
It is given by an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) who is skilled at this type of injection.
Macugen contains the active ingredient pegaptanib sodium.
What is Macugen used for?
Macugen is used to treat patients with the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
This disease affects the central part of the retina (called the macula), at the back of the eye and causes loss of vision.
The macula provides central vision that is needed for driving a car, reading fine print, and other similar tasks.
The wet form of the disease is caused by abnormal blood vessels under the retina and the macula, which may bleed and leak fluid.
This causes the loss of vision.
AMD is rare in people under 55 years of age.
It is more common in people 75 years of age or older (1 in 20 people of this age group are affected by AMD).
How is Macugen used?
Macugen is given as one injection into the affected eye every 6 weeks.
An ophthalmologist who is skilled at this type of injection should give Macugen.
Before each injection, a local anaesthetic will be given to reduce or prevent any pain from the injection.
Antibiotic eye drops may also be given before and after the Macugen injection, to prevent eye infection.
How does Macugen work?
Macugen blocks a substance called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor which makes the blood vessels grow, and also causes fluid to leak from the vessels and swelling.
All these effects are thought to worsen the disease.
Macugen blocks this factor so there is less growth of these blood vessels, and less bleeding and leakage.
How has Macugen been studied?
Macugen has been investigated in two main clinical studies.
The studies included 1190 patients and lasted up to two years.
The safety and efficacy of three different doses of Macugen were studied (0.3 mg, 1 mg and 3 mg).
These were compared with usual care consisting of a sham intervention (exactly the same procedure but without Macugen, and using no needle).

What benefit has Macugen shown during the studies?
After one year of treatment, the group of patients treated with Macugen 0.3 mg and 1 mg had less visual loss, compared with the group treated with usual care sham intervention.
This improvement lasted for patients who were given Macugen for 2 years.
What is the risk associated with Macugen?
The most common side effects (more than 1 in 10 patients in clinical trials) are eye problems caused by the injection rather than the medicine.
For instance, the pressure in the eye may temporarily increase; your ophthalmologist will check for this after the injection and will take corrective measures if needed.
Sometimes, endophthalmitis (an infection inside the eye) can occur after Macugen treatment.
It is important to treat this type of infection as soon as possible.
The symptoms of this infection and instructions about what to do if a patient has these symptoms are explained in the package leaflet.
For the full description of the side effects reported with Macugen, please see the package leaflet Macugen must not be used to treat patients who have or may have an infection in or around the eye.
Macugen should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pegaptanib sodium or any of the other ingredients.
In rare cases, serious allergic reaction has been reported soon after the injection.
The package leaflet advises patients to tell their doctor if they know to be allergic to any substance.
Why has Macugen been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that in patients with wet AMD, 1 year of treatment with Macugen (0.3 mg or 1 mg) reduces vision loss when compared with patients given sham intervention.
The effects of Macugen 0.3 mg and 1 mg are almost identical, so the lower dose of 0.3 mg was approved.
It is important to realise that Macugen only slightly slows down vision loss but this disease is severe and there is a need for other treatments.
The CHMP decided that Macugen’ s benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that Macugen be given marketing authorisation (made available to doctors).
What are the measures to minimise the risk associated with Macugen?
The company that makes Macugen will provide education for doctors (to minimise the risks associated with the injection in the eye) and for patients (so they can recognise any serious side effects, and know when to seek urgent attention from their doctor).
The company will also study if some patients could be more at risk of side effects compared to others.
Other information about Macugen:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Macugen to Pfizer Limited on 31 January 2006.
