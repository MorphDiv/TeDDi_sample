ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
The print KIOSlave gives quick access to browse different & kdeprint; sections via virtual folders. These folders provide some information about and quick access to your print subsystem.
print: / represents one more of those useful KIOSlaves implemented by & kde;. To access it, just type print: / into the address field of & konqueror;. print: / does n't purely provide read-only access to your print subsystem, but it also allows you to change settings of your printers, of your print system and lets you create new printers and classes.
You are asked for the Administrator or root password, if you are not allowed a view or an operation as a normal user.
You can bookmark frequently used shortcuts like print: / manager
Valid syntax is either print: / [path-to-virtual-folder] or print: [path-to-virtual-folder]
Note, that some of the views and actions offered do heavily depend on the print subsystem that is installed on your box and presently activated for & kde;. Pages showing printer information display only those parts that are valid for the & kde; selected print subsystem. (So if you normally run CUPS, but switched temporarily to Generic UNIX LPD Printing, which is possible, you will see less printer info, because LPD is not capable of using the same amount of print settings as are possible in CUPS).
Valid syntax to access different virtual folders and a short explanation of what they represent:
Some examples
print: / (ie; the root of print-kioslave)
virtual root for browsing your print subsystem. It displays subfolders Classes, Jobs, Manager, Printers, and Specials
print: / classes or print: classes
view your printer classes (supported by and useful for CUPS only)
print: / classes/ class_name or print: classes/ class_name
view all members of the named printer class (supported by and useful only for CUPS)
print: / jobs or print: jobs
lists the current and pending jobs.
print: / printers or print: printers
lists all your printers. Clicking on a printer name shows more info about that printer.
print: / printers/ printer_name or print: printers/ printer_name
displays useful info about the named printer
print: / manager or print: manager
opens a page very similar to the & kdeprint; Manager module inside the & kde; Control Center. Switch to a different printing system here or do every other administrative task.
This is the most important of access points to your printing system.
print: / specials or print: specials
lists all presently available special printers: Likely you'll see:
The two that let you save a printfile to disk, in & PostScript; or PDF format.
One that sends it as a PDF attachment via & kmail;.
And last, send it via fax, if you have one of the supported fax backends active, Hylafax or efax.
You can also put print: / manager or similar as the command in the Quick Command utility (started via Alt; F2)
You can learn more about printing and & kdeprint; 's powerful abilities by reading the kdeprint; Handbook locally or at the kdeprint; Website where there are documents online (HTML and PDF), containing Tutorials, as well as FAQs and Tips and Tricks related to printing in general.
