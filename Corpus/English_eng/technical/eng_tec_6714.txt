GNOME Chess
GNOME Chess is a simple chess game. You can play against your computer at three different difficulty levels, or against a friend at your computer.
Computer chess enthusiasts will appreciate GNOME Chess's compatibility with nearly all modern computer chess engines, and its ability to detect several popular engines automatically if installed.
