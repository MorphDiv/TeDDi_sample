Cannot unlock the session because the authentication system failed to work; you must kill kscreenlocker (pid %1) manually.
& Start New Session
You have chosen to open another desktop session instead of resuming the current one. The current session will be hidden and a new login screen will be displayed. An F-key is assigned to each session; F%1 is usually assigned to the first session, F%2 to the second session and so on. You can switch between sessions by pressing Ctrl, Alt and the appropriate F-key at the same time. Additionally, the KDE Panel and Desktop menus have actions for switching between sessions.

Enables the screen saver.
Screen saver timeout
Sets the seconds after which the screen saver is started.
Suspend screen saver when DPMS kicks in
Usually the screen saver is suspended when display power saving kicks in, as nothing can be seen on the screen anyway, obviously. However, some screen savers actually perform useful computations, so it is not desirable to suspend them.
