General
tab enables you to define the general properties of a form control.
These properties differ, depending on the control type.
Not all of the following properties are available for every control.
If you export the current form document to HTML format, the default control values are exported, not the current control values.
Default values are determined - depending on the type of control - by the properties' Default value (for example, in text fields), Default status (for check boxes and option fields), and Default selection (for list boxes).
Enabled
If a control field has the property &quot; Enabled &quot; (Yes), the form user will be able to use the control field.
If the property is disabled, it will not be enabled (No) and will be displayed in a grey colour.
Line count
Specifies how many lines should be displayed in the dropdown list.
This setting is only active if you chose &quot; Yes &quot; in the &quot; Dropdown &quot; option.
For combo boxes with the Dropdown property, you can specify how many lines should be displayed in the dropdown list.
With control fields which do not have the Dropdown option, the line's display will be specified by the size of the control field and the font size.
Action
The Action property determines the action that occurs when you activate a button.
You can use navigation actions to design your own database navigation buttons.
