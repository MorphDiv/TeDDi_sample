DATE

DATE function
DATE
This function converts a date written as year, month, day to an internal serial number and displays it in the cell's formatting.
The default format of a cell containing the DATE function is the date format, but you can format the cells with any other number format, e.g. the
0
number format displays the internal serial number of the date as a number.
Syntax:
DATE(Year; Month; Day)
Year
is an integer in the range 1583 to 9956 or 0 to 99.
Tools - Options - $[officename] - General
you can define for which years a two-digit number entry is recognised as 20xx.
Month
is an integer in the range 1 to 12 indicating the month.
Day
is an integer in the range 1 to 31 indicating the day of the month.
=DATE(00; 12; 31)
the result will be
31/12/00
.
If, on the other hand, you enter
=DATE(00; 13; 31)
the result will be
31/01/01.
Example:
=DATE(00; 01; 31)
yields 31/01/00 if the cell format setting is DD/MM/YY.
