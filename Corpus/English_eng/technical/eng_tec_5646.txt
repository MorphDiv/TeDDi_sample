Introduction
Gametype:
Logic, Arcade
Number of possible players:
One
& katomic; is a fun and educational game built around molecular geometry. It employs a simplistic two-dimensional look at the elements which comprise a molecule. A molecule is disassembled into its separate atoms and scattered around the playing field. The player must reassemble the molecule in order to complete the current level and move up to the next one.
How to Play
Objective:
Reassemble molecules from compound atoms by sliding them around.
& katomic; will load level one once you start the game and you can begin playing right away. To see how the molecule you are supposed to make looks like, take a look at the upper right corner. To play, click on an atom. You will see green arrows pointing in the directions where atom can move. To move the atom, click on the desired arrow. When an atom starts moving, it will not stop until it hits another atom or a wall, so make sure you think before you do your next move. You can assemble your molecule wherever you like on the game board, but some places are easier to access than others. When the molecule is assembled, you can move to the next level.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Game Rules
Game pieces can only move in one direction at a time.
Once an atom begins moving it will not stop until it meets either a wall or another piece.
The only way to progress to the next game level is to complete a current one. Once a player completes a certain level the game automatically switches to the next one, thus'uncovering it '.
A player can only switch between the levels which have been uncovered.
The game progress is automatically saved every time an adjacent level is reached, and will be reloaded the next time application is started.
Strategies and Tips
Always review the complete molecule using the reference screen before making any moves.
Next, study the play field and plan your moves. Remember, once a piece is moved it may not be possible to return it into the starting position.
Think through your every move and try to visualize the trajectory piece will follow once a directional arrow is clicked.
When using the keyboard to move pieces make sure that the desired piece is selected. If a wrong atom is marked as selected, use the & Tab; key to switch between the pieces until you reach a desired one.

Frequently asked questions
How do I know what the molecule looks like?
You can view the molecule on the reference screen located in the top right corner of the game screen.
How do I move a game piece (atom)?
To move a game piece (atom) use your mouse cursor to click on it. At this time the available directional icon will become visible. Click on the corresponding directional icon to make a game piece move into the desired direction. Alternatively, you can use your keyboard to move the pieces. Use the & Tab; key to switch between the items, and the cursor keys to move them once selected.
Can I use the keyboard to control the pieces (atoms)?
Yes. Use & Tab; key to switch between the items, and he cursor keys to move them once selected.
When I move a piece (atom) it goes right past the place where I want it. How do I make it stop there?
You do n't. Once an atom begins moving, it will not stop until it meets either a wall or another piece.
I cannot beat the level. Is there a hint system, or a solver?
No. Unfortunately at this time & katomic; does not feature a hint system. So the only way to finish a level is to solve it on your own.

atomic entertainment
Atomic Entertainment is a small game which resembles Sokoban. The object of the game is to build chemical molecules on a Sokoban like board.
Playing Atomic Entertainment
The aim of Atomic Entertainment is to build chemical molecules using basic atoms you are given. The molecule being built is shown in a frame in the main window.
Clicking on an atom will cause arrows to appear beside it. These arrows show the direction the atom can be moved. After an arrow is clicked, the atom will move in this direction until it reaches the next border or another atom. If two atoms touch each other with the corresponding connectors, they form a molecule. The atoms can only be moved one at a time.
The level is solved when the new molecule has the same structure as shown in the preview window.
In the higher levels, some tactical skill will be necessary for solving the puzzle.
The best score in this game is actually the lower score, because the goal is to solve a level with as few moves as possible. Highscore: in the main-window shows the lowest number of moves used for this level. Your score so far: shows the current number of moves.
The scrollbar on the top right of the main window changes the game level.
