EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
TARCEVA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Tarceva?
Tarceva are white to pale yellow round tablets, which contain 25, 100 or 150 mg of the active substance erlotinib.
What is Tarceva used for?
Tarceva is an anticancer medicine.
It is used to treat adult patients with the following diseases: • non-small cell lung cancer.
Tarceva is used in advanced cancer or metastatic cancer (when cancer cells have spread from the original site to other parts of the body), when at least one previous chemotherapy treatment has failed.
Tarceva has not been shown to be effective in patients whose tumours are ‘ EGFR-negative’. ‘ EGFR-negative’ means that some receptors, the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), cannot be detected on the surface of the cancer cells, or can only be detected in small quantities. • metastatic pancreatic cancer, in combination with gemcitabine (another anticancer medicine).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Tarceva used?
Treatment with Tarceva should be supervised by a doctor who has experience of the use of anticancer medicines.
For lung cancer, the recommended daily dose of Tarceva is 150 mg.
For pancreatic cancer, it is 100 mg.
Tarceva is taken at least one hour before or two hours after food.
If needed (for example because of side effects), the dose may be reduced in 50 mg steps.
Treatment of pancreatic cancer should be re-assessed after 4 to 8 weeks if no rash has developed.
Tarceva is not recommended for use in patients with severe liver or kidney disease.
How does Tarceva work?
The active substance in Tarceva, erlotinib, is an anti-cancer medicine that belongs to the group ‘ epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors’.
Erlotinib blocks the epidermal growth factor receptors, which can be found on the surface of certain tumour cells.
As a result of this block, the tumour cell can no longer receive the messages needed for growth, progression and spreading (metastasis).
This helps Tarceva stop the cancer cells from growing and multiplying.

The effects of Tarceva were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The main study in non-small cell lung cancer involved 731 patients who had not responded to at least one previous chemotherapy treatment.
The main study in pancreatic cancer involved 569 patients with advanced, unresectable (unable to be removed by surgery) or metastatic pancreatic cancer, in combination with gemcitabine.
In both studies, Tarceva was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) and the main measure of effectiveness was ‘ median survival’ (time until 50% of the patients were still alive).
What benefit has Tarceva shown during the studies?
For lung cancer, the median survival for the Tarceva patients was 6.7 months, compared with 4.7 months for the patients treated with placebo.
After 12 months, 31.2% of the patients taking erlotinib were still alive, compared with 21.5% of patients treated with placebo.
When looking at the results in patients who received Tarceva, and according to their tumour type, the survival figures were 8.6 months in patients who were ‘ EGFR-positive’ (those who had tumour cells that were shown to carry EGFR), compared with 5.0 months in patients who were EGFR-negative.
For metastatic pancreatic cancer, the mediansurvival in the patients treated with Tarceva was 5.9 months, compared to 5.1 months in those taking placebo.
However, there was no survival advantage for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer that had not spread beyond the pancreas.
What is the risk associated with Tarceva?
In clinical studies, the most common side effects when taking Tarceva (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) were rash and diarrhoea.
Most of these were not serious and could be managed without treatment.
More serious rash and diarrhoea occurred in approximately 5-10% of Tarceva-treated patients and each side effect caused up to 1% of patients to stop treatment.
Patients with persistent and severe diarrhoea should contact their doctor, as they may be at risk of low blood potassium levels and kidney failure.
They may need to be treated in hospital.
For the full list of side effects reported with Tarceva, please see the Package Leaflet.
Tarceva should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to erlotinib or any of the other ingredients.
It should be used with caution if the patient is taking other medicines, including warfarin (a medicine used to thin the blood), ketoconazole (to treat fungal infections), antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin) or St.
John’ s wort (a herbal remedy).
See the Package Leaflet for full details.
Smoking should also be stopped as it could decrease the amount of medicine in the blood.
Why has Tarceva been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Tarceva had shown that it is effective in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, although there was not enough justification for, or data on its use in patients whose tumours are EGFR-negative.
The committee decided that Tarceva’ s benefits are greater than its risks for these types of cancer, as well as for metastatic cancer of the pancreas.
For pancreatic cancer, the committee concluded that doctors and patients should take the patient ’ s chances of survival into account when prescribing Tarceva.
The committee recommended that Tarceva be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Tarceva:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Tarceva to Roche Registration Limited on 19 September 2005.
