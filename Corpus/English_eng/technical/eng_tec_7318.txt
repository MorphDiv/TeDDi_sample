Introduction

Simulated secondary click: it allows the user to perform a secondary click (menu click) by holding down the primary mouse button while keeping the pointer motionless.
Dwell click: it allows the user to perform the various clicks without pressing any
Pointer capture: it allows the user to lock the pointer in a determined area of the panel until the user releases it by a predefined keystroke or mouse button.
How To Start The Functions
The simulated secondary click and the dwell click depend on the mousetweaks process; however the pointer capture applet depends on the GNOME panel. Consequently, also the methods to start them vary.
Starting The Simulated Secondary Click Function
You can start the Simulated Secondary Click in two ways:
from the graphical user interface
from the command line
Start From The Graphical User Interface
The graphical user interface to start the simulated secondary click is located in the Accessibility tab of the Mouse control panel. To open it, choose the menu

To start the simulated secondary click function, put a checkmark into the checkbox that says:
Trigger secondary click by holding down the primary button

To start the simulated secondary click from the command line, open the

mousetweaks
Starting The Dwell Click Function
You can start the dwell click function in three ways:
from the Accessibility tab of the Mouse control panel
from the On/Off button on the Dwell Click panel applet
Start From The Accessibility tab of the Mouse control panel
The graphical user interface to start the dwell click is located in the Accessibility tab of the Mouse control panel. To open it, choose the menu
To start the dwell click function, put a checkmark into the checkbox that says:
Initiate click when stopping pointer movement

To start the dwell click function and show the click type window from the command line, open the
--enable-dwell --show-ctw
Start From The On/Off button On The Dwell Click Panel Applet
It is possible to start the Dwell Click by simply resting (dwelling) for a little delay with the pointer on the On/Off button of the Dwell Click panel applet. The On/Off button provides feedback of the passing dwell time by filling its frame with another colour. When the frame is completely filled, the button displays its active state and the dwell click gets started.

Starting The Pointer Capture Function
For instructions about how to install the Dwell Click applet on the GNOME panel, please have a look at
As the Pointer Capture applet comes in the from of a panel applet, its starting method has to follow the rules dictated by the GNOME panel. Thus, to start the Pointer Capture function, you only have to install it on the panel and it will automatically run.
In order to add it to the panel, proceed as you do with any panel applet: perform a secondary click on the panel to open its contextual menu, choose

How To Quit The Functions
Similar to the starting of the functions, their quitting also depends on the feature that you want to quit.
Quitting The Simulated Secondary Click
It is possible to quit the Simulated Secondary Click in two ways:
By removing the mark from the corresponding checkbox in the control panel of

By typing the following command at the command line:
--shutdown
Quitting The Dwell Click
It is possible to quit the dwell click in three ways:
Picture of the checkbox to start the buttonless click feature
Please refer to
If the Dwell Click applet has been installed on the GNOME panel, the Dwell Click can be disabled by dwelling with the pointer on its On/Off button.
Quitting The Pointer Capture Function
As the Pointer Capture function comes in the form of a panel applet, you have to quit it the same way that you do it with other applets: you have to remove it from the GNOME panel. To do it, perform a right click on the handle of the applet and choose

When using the default GNOME theme, the handle of the Pointer Capture applet are the two vertical dotted lines at the left of the pointer capture area.
Description Of The Functions
Mousetweaks offers three pointer accessibility functions to the user. In this section you will find the description of the three functions:
Simulated Secondary Click Description
When the user activates this feature, he will be able to perform secondary clicks by using the
Picture showing the settings belonging to the Simulated Secondary Click.
How Does It Work?
Let us assume that the user has enabled the Simulated Secondary Click feature.
To perform a simulated secondary click, the user has to keep the

Motion Threshold
People that have trouble to keep the pointer completely motionless can use the Motion Threshold slider of the Dwell Click feature. This setting makes mousetweaks ignore little mouse movements, so that the simulated secondary click is issued even if the pointer is not completely motionless. Please have a look at the section of the
The
Differences To The Normal Secondary Click
As the Simulated Secondary Click is not able to discard the
It is not possible to perform a secondary click on multiple items because the primary click issued before the secondary click deselects the items.
When the simulated secondary click is performed on the trash icon on the panel, not only does the contextual menu appear, but the trash folder does also open. (The former is caused by the secondary click, the latter by the primary click preceding the right click.)
It is not possible to provide a list of all diverging behaviours, because it depends on the reaction of the application receiving the secondary click preceded by a primary click.
Some users may also be surprised by the consequences of the following: it is not possible to perform a long motionless primary button click and hold, without also triggering the secondary click. For example:
When keeping the primary button pressed on the arrow of a scrollbar, the scrollbar jumps to the bottom after some time. This is in fact the normal behaviour of a secondary click on an arrow of a scrollbar.
To work around this behaviour, simply move the pointer immediately after pressing the
Dwell Click Description
There are users that cannot use any hardware button. By activating the
When the dwell click is active, the
Each time the pointer stops moving, a dwell click is initiated. To give feedback to the user, mousetweaks will fill the arrow of the pointer with another color while it is counting down the time before the click completion kicks in.
How the click is completed and how the click type is chosen depends on what dwell mode the user has selected. The two available modes are:
Choose type of click beforehand
Choose type of click with mouse gestures

To select the mode, the user only has to click on the radio button that corresponds to his choice.
Automatic Click Completion With Click Type Choice Beforehand
This mode is active when the user selects

Click Completion And Click Type Choice By Mouse Gesture
This mode is active when the user selects
If the user moves the pointer while it is showing the gesture shape, a click is performed at the location where the pointer was last motionless; finally the pointer returns to its normal shape. The type of click performed depends on the direction of the movement of the mouse. During the movement of the pointer, a line is drawn following the movement of the pointer to give feedback to the user.
If the user keeps the pointer motionless until it returns to its normal shape, the user can move the mouse without a click being performed. The next dwell click can be performed at the next pointer stop.
The user also has the possibility to match click type with movement direction by using the 4

There is also a
Dwell Delay Setting

The dwell delay only works in the context of the dwell click.
Motion Threshold Setting
For people that have trouble to keep the mouse motionless, there is the
Picture showing the motion threshold slider of the dwell click
When the slider is set towards low, even little mouse movements are considered; however, by setting a higher threshold, the pointer has to travel a bigger distance before it is considered as moving.
The Motion Threshold setting does not only work for the Dwell Click, but also for the Simulated Secondary Click, even if the Dwell Click is disabled.
Locking The Pointer Description
There are people that have to use their pointing device not only for the computer. These people would welcome a way to lock the pointer into an area of the screen, so that they can use their pointing device for other tasks.
In fact, the Pointer Capture panel applet creates an area on the panel, into which the user can lock the pointer until he releases it in a determined way.
