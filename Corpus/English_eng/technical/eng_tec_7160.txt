This book is most effective when used in conjunction with the Conglomerate XML Editor V0.7.10.
Throughout this book the
Familiarity with the standard controls and Notations provided by the Window Manager and Linux File System is assumed.
The following admonitions will be found throughout the book:
A note presents interesting, sometimes technical, pieces of information related to the surrounding discussion.
A tip offers advice or an easier way of doing something.
A caution advises you of potential problems and helps you to steer clear thereof.
A warning advises you of a hazard condition that may be created in a given scenario.
Type conventions will be shown as follows:
File names or paths to directories will be shown in
Commands that you type at a prompt will be shown in
Options that you click, select or choose in the user interface will be shown in
When variables, parameters, sgmltags etc. are contained within a paragraph of text will be shown in

Cross reference conventions for print will be shown as follows:

PDF, HTML or XHTML versions of this document will use hyper-links to denote cross-references.
Code conventions:
Code and mark-up samples will be formatted in a Grey block.
Sometimes lines of code or mark-up examples will be longer than the page width. To avoid from them running off the page, the slash character "\\" is used to denote a soft line break. This means that the line of code is in reality meant to be on one line, but for print formatting it has been broken into two lines. For the example below, the line starting with msgbox has been cut so that the comment will not run off the right-side of the page.

Alternative methods of installation include installation from
Installation from tarball
Releases are frequently packaged into tarballs and placed on the
When a new release is announced the tarball may take upto 24 hours to display in the Web based CVS interface.
General installation overview

Login as root.

cp filename-0.2.3.tar.gz /usr/src/packages/

cd /usr/src/packages/

tar xzvf filename-0.2.3.tar.gz

cd filename-0.2.3

./configure
If there are no errors,

If there are errors, resolve them if required.
make install
This will install to the default path
Installation from CVS
If you don't mind running on the "bleeding-edge" of development, you may also run your installation from the project
As a result of the ongoing application of patches and addition of new components to the source, installation from CVS is not guaranteed to work.

Editor Window Document Area
The document area is the main workspace. It provides two views of the open document:


Each view is shown in a pane. The separator between the panes can be used to adjust how much of the document area is taken up by each of the views.
Outline view
Shows the structure of the document in a "Tree View" control. The outline view provides two XML tree perspectives of the open document:


Both perspectives enable the tree structure of the open document to be navigated. Starting from the root node of the tree, elements that have "child" or "sibling-elements" can be expanded and collapsed.
A context-sensitive pop-up menu is available when a selected node is
The options displayed on the pop-up are dependent on the selected node type. For example, when nodes that are representative of the tree root,

Raw XML tree perspective
In Raw XML perspective the tree nodes of the open document are shown using the full XML syntax, so the "greater-than" (lt;) and "less-than" (gt;) characters the surround element names are shown. The value of the element, the tagged text, is also shown alongside the element in inverted commas (see
