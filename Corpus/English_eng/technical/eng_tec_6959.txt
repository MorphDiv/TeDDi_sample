Overview

Filter
This tool is used to soften tile seams in images used in tiled backgrounds. It does this by blending and blurring the boundary between images that will be next to each other after tiling.
If you want to treat only images borders, you can't apply filter to the whole image. The solution to get the wanted effect is as follows:
Duplicate layer (
Apply
Select all (
Give a feathered border to the selection by using

Radial blur
Zoom blur
The Motion Blur filter creates a movement blur. The filter is capable of Linear, Radial, and Zoom movements. Each of these movements can be further adjusted, with Length, or Angle settings available.
You can find this filter in the image menu under

Linear
Is a blur that travels in a single direction, horizontally, for example. In this case, Length means as Radius in other filters:it represents the blur intensity. More Length will result in more blurring. Angle describes the actual angle of the movement. Thus, a setting of 90 will produce a vertical blur, and a setting of 0 will produce a horizontal blur.
Radial
motion blur that creates a circular blur. The Length slider is not important with this type of blur. Angle on the other hand, is the primary setting that will affect the blur. More Angle will result in more blurring in a circular direction. The Radial motion blur is similar to the effect of a spinning object. The center of the spin in this case, is the center of the image.
Zoom
Produces a blur that radiates out from the center of the image. The center of the image remains relatively calm, whilst the outer areas become blurred toward the center. This filter option produces a perceived forward movement, into the image. Length is the main setting here, and affects the amount of speed, as it were, toward the center of the image.
Blur settings
Length
This slider controls the distance pixels are moved (1 - 256)
Angle
As seen above, Angle slider effect depends on Blur type (0 - 360).
Blur Center
With this option, you can set the starting point of movement. Effect is different according to the Blur Type you have selected. With Radial Type for instance, you set rotation center. With Zoom Type, vanishing point. This option is greyed out with Linear type.
You have to set the blur center coordinates. Unfortunately, you can't do that by clicking on the image. But, by moving mouse pointer on the image, you can see its coordinates in the lower left corner of the image window. Only copy them out into the input boxes.

Introduction
Original for demo
This is a set of filters that blur images, or parts of them, in various ways. If there is a selection, only the selected parts of an image will be blurred. There may, however, be some leakage of colors from the unblurred area into the blurred area. To help you pick the one you want, we will illustrate what each does when applied to the image shown at right. These are, of course, only examples: most of the filters have parameter settings that allow you to vary the magnitude or type of blurring.
Gaussian blur (radius 10)
The most broadly useful of these is the Gaussian blur. (Don't let the word "Gaussian" throw you: this filter makes an image blurry in the most basic way.) It has an efficient implementation that allows it to create a very blurry blur in a relatively short time.
Simple blur
If you only want to blur the image a little bit — to soften it, as it were — you might use the simple "Blur" filter. This filter runs automatically, without creating a dialog. The effect is subtle enough that you might not even notice it, but you can get a stronger effect by repeating it. In GIMP 2.0 the filter shows a dialog that allows you to set a "repeat count". If you want a strong blurring effect, this filter is too slow to be a good choice: use a Gaussian blur instead.
Selective blur
The Selective Blur filter allows you to set a threshold so that only pixels that are similar to each other are blurred together. It is often useful as a tool for reducing graininess in photos without blurring sharp edges. (In the example, note that the graininess of the background has been reduced.) The implementation is much slower than a Gaussian blur, though, so you should not use it unless you really need the selectivity.
Pixelize
The Pixelize filter produces the well-known "Abraham Lincoln" effect by turning the image into a set of large square pixels. (The
You can find a nice explanation of the Abraham Lincoln effect at
Motion blur
The Motion Blur filter blurs in a specific direction at each point, which allows you to create a sense of motion: either linear, radial, or rotational.
Finally, the Tileable Blur filter is really the same thing as a Gaussian blur, except that it wraps around the edges of an image to help you reduce edge effects when you create a pattern by tiling multiple copies of the image side by side.
Tileable Blur is actually implemented by a Script-Fu script that invokes the Gaussian blur plug-in.

Selective Gaussian Blur
Selective Gaussian
The Selective Gaussian Blur filter
Contrary to the other blur plug-ins, the Selective Gaussian Blur plug-in doesn't act on all pixels: blur is applied only if the difference between its value and the value of the surrounding pixels is less than a defined Delta value. So, contrasts are preserved because difference is high on contrast limits. It is used to blur a background so that the foreground subject will stand out better. This add a sense of depth to the image with only a single operation.
You can find this filter in the image menu under

Blur Radius
Here you can set the blur intensity, in pixels.
Max. Delta
Here you can set the maximum difference (0-255) between the pixel value and the surrounding pixel values. Above this Delta, blur will not be applied to that pixel.

Gaussian Blur
Example for the
The IIR Gaussian Blur plug-in acts on each pixel of the active layer or selection, setting its Value to the average of all pixel Values present in a radius defined in the dialog. A higher Value will produce a higher amount of blur. The blur can be set to act in one direction more than the other by clicking the Chain Button so that it is broken, and altering the radius. GIMP supports two implementations of Gaussian Blur: IIR G.B. and RLE G.B. They both produce the same results, but each one can be faster in some cases.

Here you can set the blur intensity. By altering the ratio of horizontal to vertical blur, you can give the effect of a motion blur. You can choose the unit with the drop list.
Blur Method

The Blur filter applied to a photograph
The simple Blur filter produces an effect similar to that of an out of focus camera shot. To produce this blur effect, the filter takes the average of the present pixel value and the value of adjacent pixels and sets the present pixel to that average value.
Filter advantage is its calculation speed. It suits big images.
Filter disadvantage is that its action is hardly perceptible on big images, but very strong on small images.
