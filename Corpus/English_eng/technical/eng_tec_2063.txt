In cell references, a sheet name must be enclosed in single quotes ' if the name contains characters other than alphanumeric or underscore.
A single quote contained within a name must be escaped by doubling it (two single quotes).
For example, you want to reference the cell A1 on a sheet with the following name:
This year's sheet
The reference must be enclosed in single quotes, and the one single quote inside the name must be doubled:
'This year''s sheet'.A1
The name of a sheet is independent of the name of the spreadsheet.
You enter the spreadsheet name when you save it for the first time as a file.
