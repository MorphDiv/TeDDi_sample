Uninvited Connections
Allow & uninvited connections
Select this option to allow connecting without inviting. This is useful if you want to access your desktop remotely.
Announce service & on the network
If you allow uninvited connections and enable this option, Desktop Sharing will announce the service and your identity on the local network, so people can find you and your computer.
Confirm uninvited connections & before accepting
If enabled, a dialog will appear when somebody attempts to connect, asking you whether you want to accept the connection.
Allow uninvited connections to control the desktop
Enable this option to allow uninvited user to control your desktop (using mouse and keyboard).
Password:
If you allow uninvited connections, it is highly recommended to set a password in order to protect your computer from unauthorized access.
& Session
Session Preferences
Always disable & background image
Check this option to always disable the background image during a remote session. Otherwise the client decides whether the background will be enabled or disabled.
& Network
Network Port
Assign port automatically
Check this option to assign the network port automatically. This is recommended unless your network setup requires you to use a fixed port, for example because of a firewall.
Port:
Enter the TCP port number here
Use this field to set a static port number for the desktop sharing service. Note that if the port is already in use the Desktop Sharing service will not be accessible until you free it. It is recommended to assign the port automatically unless you know what you are doing. Most VNC clients use a display number instead of the actual port. This display number is the offset to port 5900, so port 5901 has the display number 1.
