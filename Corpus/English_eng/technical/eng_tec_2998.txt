(PHP 4)
This function returns an array of the names of the declared classes in the current script.
Note:
In PHP 4.0.1pl2, three extra classes are returned at the beginning of the array: stdClass (defined in Zend / zend.c), OverloadedTestClass (defined in ext / standard / basic_functions.c) and Directory (defined in ext / standard / dir.c).
Also note that depending on what libraries you have compiled into PHP, additional classes could be present.
This means that you will not be able to define your own classes using these names.
There is a list of predefined classes in the Predefined Classes section of the appendices.
See also class_exists().
