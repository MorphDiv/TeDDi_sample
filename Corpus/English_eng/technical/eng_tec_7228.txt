Installation
Installation from a tarball
Download
To unpack the source, open a terminal and type :
$ tar -zxvf ~/sabayon-2.29.0.tar.gz
$ cd sabayon-2.29.0
Then you can configure and compile the program:
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --mandir=/usr/share/man
$ make
$ sudo make install
Add a user (you must have root permissions) :
Sabayon
# /usr/sbin/useradd -c "
Create the directory
# mkdir /var/sabayon
Apply the following permissions :
# chown -R sabayon /var/sabayon
# chgrp -R nogroup /var/sabayon

Your distribution probably contains a pre-packaged version of
Installing from the git repository
For those who wish to be on the bleeding edge, you can install

$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/sabayon
$ cd sabayon
$ ./autogen.sh â€“prefix=/usr
At this point, simply follow the same instructions for configuring and compiling the program as you did for installing from a tarball.
