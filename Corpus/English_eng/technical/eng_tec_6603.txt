CD will not play in a CD player
If your CD is not playing in your CD player or stereo, it is probably because the music was not correctly written to the disc or because you used a data project to write the music to the CD instead of an audio project.
Many new CD and DVD players will play music CDs which were created using a data project, but most older players will not.
Older CD players might not be able to play CD-RWs.
If you are using a CD-RW, blank the CD.
Rewrite the CD as an audio project.
I cannot write to a DVD-R or a DVD-RW.
Problem creating a DVD
Some types of DVD-Rs and DVD-RWs are not compatible with all burners. Check the following to find out if those can be used with your burner.
Check if your DVD drive accepts DVD+ or DVD- discs; if it is labelled with "multi", that usually indicates that it accepts both. Check your disc to see if it is the same as the DVD drive.
Check if your disc is dual layer or single layer: some DVD drives can not write to a dual layer disc.
If you are trying to use a DVD-R, check if it has already been written to before. If you are using a DVD-RW, try blanking it before you attempt to write to it.

Disc images are archive files which contain all the data that is on a CD or DVD. Only one disc image can be on a CD at a time, but each archive can contain as little or as much data as you want, as long as it fits on the disc.
