PHP Manual

(PHP 4 = 4.0.6)
dbx_connect() returns an object on success, FALSE on error.
If a connection has been made but the database could not be selected, the connection is closed and FALSE is returned.
The persistent parameter can be set to DBX_PERSISTENT, if so, a persistent connection will be created.
The module parameter can be either a string or a constant, though the latter form is preferred.
The possible values are given below, but keep in mind that they only work if the module is actually loaded.
DBX_MYSQL or "mysql"
DBX_ODBC or "odbc"
DBX_PGSQL or "pgsql"
DBX_MSSQL or "mssql"
DBX_FBSQL or "fbsql" (available from PHP 4.1.0)
DBX_SYBASECT or "sybase_ct" (available from PHP 4.2.0)
DBX_OCI8 or "oci8" (available from PHP 4.3.0)
The host, database, username and password parameters are expected, but not always used depending on the connect functions for the abstracted module.
The returned object has three properties:
It is the name of the currently selected database.
It is a valid handle for the connected database, and as such it can be used in module-specific functions (if required).
$link = dbx_connect (DBX_MYSQL, "localhost", "db", "username", "password"); mysql_close ($link - handle); / / dbx_close($link) would be better here
It is used internally by dbx only, and is actually the module number mentioned above.
Example 1. dbx_connect() example
?php $link = dbx_connect (DBX_ODBC, "", "db", "username", "password", DBX_PERSISTENT) or die ("Could not connect"); print ("Connected successfully"); dbx_close ($link);?
Note:
Always refer to the module-specific documentation as well.
