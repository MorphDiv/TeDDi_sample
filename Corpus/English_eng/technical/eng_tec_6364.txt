Session Manager You can configure the session manager here. This includes options such as whether or not the session exit (logout) should be confirmed, whether the session should be restored again when logging in and whether the computer should be automatically shut down after session exit by default.
General
Check this option if you want the session manager to display a logout confirmation dialog box.
Confirm logout
Offer shutdown options
Here you can choose what should happen by default when you log out. This only has meaning, if you logged in through KDM.
Default Leave Option

& Turn off computer
& Restart computer
Restore previous session: Will save all applications running on exit and restore them when they next start up Restore manually saved session: Allows the session to be saved at any time via "Save Session" in the K-Menu. This means the currently started applications will reappear when they next start up. Start with an empty session: Do not save anything. Will come up with an empty desktop on next start.
