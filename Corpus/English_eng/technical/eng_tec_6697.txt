The yearly depreciation expense is $1183.33.
Sum-Of-The-Years'-Digits Depreciation
Syd
Calculates the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified period of time, using the Sum-Of-The-Years'-Digits method. This method of depreciation accelerates the rate of depreciation, so that more depreciation expense occurs in earlier periods than in later ones. The depreciable cost is
You have just purchased an office machine for $8000. The useful life of this machine is six years. The salvage value after six years is $900. To calculate the depreciation expense for the fourth year, using the sum-of-the-years'-digits method, press
