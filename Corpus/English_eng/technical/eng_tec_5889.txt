ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Working With the & kate; MDI
Overview
Window, View, Document, Frame, Editor... What are they all in the terminology of & kate;, and how do you get the most out of it? This chapter will explain all of that, and even more.
The Main Window
Main window
The & kate; Main Window is a standard & kde; application window, with the addition of side bars containing tool views. It has a menubar with all the common menus, and some more, and a toolbar providing access to commonly used commands.
The most important part of the window is the editing area, by default displaying a single text editor component, in which you can work with your documents.
The docking capabilities of the window is used for the tool windows:
The Documents List
The Filesystem Browser
The Built in Terminal Emulator
And possibly other tool views, for example provided by plugins.
Tool views can be positioned in any sidebar, to move a tool right click its sidebar button and select from the & RMB; menu
A tool view can be marked as persistent in the & RMB; menu for its sidebar button. The sidebar can contain more tools at one time so that when a tool is persistant other tools can be shown simultaneously.
The Editor area
Editing Area
& kate; is capable of having more than one document open at the same time, and also of splitting the editing area into any number of frames, similar to how for example & konqueror; or the popular emacs text editor works. This way you can view several documents at the same time, or more instances of the same document, handy for example if your document contains definitions in the top that you want to see often for reference. Or you could view a program source header in one frame, while editing the implementation file in another.
When a document is available in more than one editor, changes made in one editor will immediately be reflected in the others as well. This includes changing the text as well as selecting text. Search operations or cursor movement is only reflected in the current editor.
It is currently not possible to have more instances of the same document open in the sense that one instance will be edited while the other will not.
When splitting an editor into two frames, it is divided into two equally sized frames, both displaying the current document of that editor. The new frame will be at the bottom (in the case of a horizontal split) or at the right (for a vertical split). The new frame gets the focus, which is visualized by the blinking cursor bar in the focused frame.
The Documents List
Documents list
The documents list displays a list of all documents currently open in & kate;. Modified files will have a small floppy disk icon on their left to indicate that state.
If two or more files with the same name (located in different folders) are open, the names of the second will be prepended lt; 2gt; and so on. The tool-tip for the file will display its full name including the path, allowing you to choose the desired one.
To display a document in the currently active frame, click the document name in the list.
You can sort the list in a few different ways by rightclicking the list and selecting from the Sort By menu. The options are
Opening Order
Lists the documents in the order of opening
Document Name
Lists the documents alphabetically by their name.
URL
Lists the documents alphabetically by URL.
Custom
Custom means you can drag and drop the items in the document list to manually sort them.
The document list will per default visualize your history by shading the entries for the most recent documents with a background color. If the document was edited, an extra color is blended in. The most recent document has the strongest color, so that you can easily find the documents you are working on. This feature can be disabled in The Document List Page of the configuration dialog.
The default location of the document list in the & kate; window is to the left of the editing area.
The Filesystem Browser
Filesystem Browser
The Filesystem Browser is a folder viewer, allowing you to open files from a displayed folder in the current frame.
From top down, the Filesystem Browser consist of the following elements:
A Toolbar
This contains standard navigations tool buttons:
Parent Folder
This will cause the folder view to cd to the immediate parent of the currently displayed folder if possible.
Back
Causes the folder view to cd to the previously displayed folder in the history. This button is disabled, if there is no previous item.
Forward
Causes the folder view to cd to the next folder in the history. This button is disabled, if there is no next folder.
Home
Pressing it will cause the folder view to cd to your home folder.
Short View
Displays only the filenames.
Detailed View
Displays Name, Date, Size and Type of the files.
Bookmarks
Opens a submenu to edit or add bookmarks and to add a new bookmark folder.
Current Document Folder
This button will cause the folder view to cd to the folder of the currently active document if possible. This button is disabled, if the active document is a new, unsaved file, or the folder in which it resides can not be decided.
A & URL; entry
Here you can type the path of a folder to browse. The & URL; entry maintains a list of previously typed paths. To choose one use the arrow button to the right of the entry.
The & URL; entry has folder auto-completion. The completion method can be set using the & RMB; menu of the text entry.
A Folder View
This is a standard & kde; folder view.
A Filter Entry
The Filter entry allows you to enter a filter for the files displayed in the folder view. The filter uses standard globs; patterns must be separated by white space. Example: *. cpp *. h *. moc
To display all files, enter a single asterisk *.
The filter entry saves the last 10 filters entered between sessions, to use one, press the arrow button on the right of the entry and select the desired filter string.
The Built in Terminal Emulator
Terminal emulator
The built in Terminal Emulator is a copy of the & kde; & konsole; terminal application, for your convenience. It is available from the Window Tools Views Show Terminal menu item and will get the focus whenever displayed. Additionally, if the Automatically synchronize the terminal with the current document when possible option is enabled, it will change into the directory of the current document if possible when it is displayed, or when the current document changes.
The default location in the & kate; window is at the bottom, below the editing area.
You can configure the & konsole; using its & RMB; menu, for more information, see the konsole; manual.
External Tools
In the Tools menu you will find a submenu labeled External Tools, if you have enabled them in & kate; settings. These tools invokes external applications with data related to the current document, for example its URL, directory, text or selection.
External tools are user defined, you can add, edit or remove tools using the External Tools configuration panel.
