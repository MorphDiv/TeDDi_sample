Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
socket_strerror() takes as its errno parameter a socket error code as returned by socket_last_error() and returns the corresponding explanatory text.
This makes it a bit more pleasant to figure out why something didn' t work; for instance, instead of having to track down a system include file to find out what '-111 'means, you just pass it to socket_strerror(), and it tells you what happened.
Example 1. socket_strerror() example
?php if (false == ($socket = @socket_create(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0))) {echo "socket_create() failed: reason: ". socket_strerror(socket_last_error()). "\n";} if (false == (@socket_bind($socket, '127.0.0.1', 80))) {echo "socket_bind() failed: reason:". socket_strerror(socket_last_error($socket)). "\n";}?
The expected output from the above example (assuming the script is not run with root privileges):
socket_bind() failed: reason:
Permission denied
