Bondenza 150 mg film-coated tablets
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each film-coated tablet contains 150 mg ibandronic acid (as ibandronic sodium monohydrate).
Excipients
Each film-coated tablet contains 162.75 mg lactose monohydrate.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet White to off white film-coated tablets, of oblong shape marked “ BNVA” on one side, and “ 150” on the other side.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture (see section 5.1).
A reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral neck fractures has not been established.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Posology:
The recommended dose is one 150 mg film-coated tablet once a month.
The tablet should preferably be taken on the same date each month.
Bondenza should be taken after an overnight fast (at least 6 hours) and 1 hour before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day (see section 4.5) or any other oral medicinal products or supplementation (including calcium).
In case a dose is missed, patients should be instructed to take one Bondenza 150 mg tablet the morning after the tablet is remembered, unless the time to the next scheduled dose is within 7 days.
Patients should then return to taking their dose once a month on their originally scheduled date.
If the next scheduled dose is within 7 days, patients should wait until their next dose and then continue taking one tablet once a month as originally scheduled.
Patients should not take two tablets within the same week.
Patients should receive supplemental calcium and / or vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate (see section 4.4 and section 4.5).
Special Populations Patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment where creatinine clearance is equal or greater than 30 ml/ min.
Bondenza is not recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/ min due to limited clinical experience (see section 4.4 and section 5.2).
2 Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).
Elderly Population No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).
Paediatric Population There is no relevant use of Bondenza in children, and Bondenza was not studied in the paediatric population.
Method of Administration:
For oral use.
Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of plain water (180 to 240 ml) while the patient is sitting or standing in an upright position.
Patients should not lie down for 1 hour after taking Bondenza.
Plain water is the only drink that should be taken with Bondenza.
Please note that some mineral waters may have a higher concentration of calcium and therefore, should not be used.
Patients should not chew or suck the tablet, because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4)
- Hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Gastrointestinal Disorders Bisphosphonates have been associated with dysphagia, oesophagitis and oesophageal or gastric ulcers.
Therefore patients, especially those with a history of prolonged oesophageal transit time, should pay particular attention to and be able to comply with the dosing instructions (see section 4.2).
Physicians should be alert to signs or symptoms signalling a possible oesophageal reaction during therapy, and patients should be instructed to discontinue Bondenza and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as new or worsening dysphagia, pain on swallowing, retrosternal pain, or heartburn.
Since Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflamatory Drugs and bisphosphonates are both associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant administration.
Hypocalcaemia Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before starting Bondenza therapy.
Other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should also be effectively treated.
Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients.
Renal impairment Due to limited clinical experience, Bondenza is not recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/ min (see section 5.2).
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw, generally associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis) has been reported in patients with cancer receiving treatment regimens including primarily intravenously administered bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in patients with osteoporosis receiving oral bisphosphonates.
3 A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene).
While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible.
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition.
For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
Clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment.
Galactose intolerance Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Oral bioavailability of ibandronic acid is generally reduced in the presence of food.
In particular, products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron), including milk, are likely to interfere with absorption of Bondenza, which is consistent with findings in animal studies.
Therefore, patients should fast overnight (at least 6 hours) before taking Bondenza and continue fasting for 1 hour following intake of Bondenza (see section 4.2).
Calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products containing multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with the absorption of Bondenza.
Therefore, patients should not take other oral medicinal products for at least 6 hours before taking Bondenza and for 1 hour following intake of Bondenza.
Metabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats.
Furthermore, plasma protein binding is approximately 85% - 87% (determined in vitro at therapeutic concentrations), and thus there is a low potential for interaction with other medicinal products due to displacement.
Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation.
The secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the excretion of other active substances.
In a two-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM 16549), the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in patients concomitantly taking aspirin or NSAIDs was similar in patients taking ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily or 150 mg once monthly after one and two years.
Of over 1500 patients enrolled in study BM 16549 comparing monthly with daily dosing regimens of ibandronic acid, 14% and 18% of patients used histamine (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors after one and two years, respectively.
Among these patients, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal events in the patients treated with Bondenza 150 mg once monthly was similar to that in patients treated with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily.
In healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, intravenous administration of ranitidine caused an increase in ibandronic acid bioavailability of about 20%, probably as a result of reduced gastric acidity.
However, since this increase is within the normal variability of the bioavailability of ibandronic acid, no dose adjustment is considered necessary when Bondenza is administered with H2- antagonists or other active substances which increase gastric pH.
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in postmenopausal women have demonstrated the absence of any interaction potential with tamoxifen or hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen).
No interaction was observed when co-administered with melphalan/ prednisolone in patients with multiple myeloma.
4 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of ibandronic acid in pregnant women.
Studies in rats have shown some reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Bondenza should not be used during pregnancy.
Lactation It is not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk.
Studies in lactating rats have demonstrated the presence of low levels of ibandronic acid in the milk following intravenous administration.
Bondenza should not be used during lactation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The safety of ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily was evaluated in 1251 patients treated in 4 placebo- controlled clinical studies; 73% of these patients came from the pivotal three-year treatment study (MF 4411).
The overall safety profile of ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in all these studies was similar to that of placebo.
The overall proportion of patients who experienced an adverse reaction, i. e. adverse event with a possible or probable relationship to trial medication, in the pivotal treatment study (MF 4411) was 19.8% for ibandronic acid and 17.9% for placebo.
In a two-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM 16549) the overall safety of Bondenza 150 mg once monthly and ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily was similar.
The overall proportion of patients who experienced an adverse reaction, was 22.7% and 25.0% for Bondenza 150 mg once monthly and 21.5% and 22.5% for ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily after one and two years, respectively.
The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.
Most cases did not lead to cessation of therapy.
Table 1 and table 2 list adverse reactions occurring in more than 1% of patients treated with Bondenza 150 mg monthly or 2.5 mg daily in study BM 16549 and in patients treated with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in study MF 4411.
The tables show the adverse reactions in the two studies that occurred with a higher incidence than in patients treated with placebo in study MF 4411.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Data at one year from BM 16549 are represented in Table 1 and cumulative data for the two years from BM 16549 are represented in table 2.

Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of less than or equal to 1%
The following list provides information on adverse reactions reported in study MF 4411 occurring more frequently with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily than with placebo and study BM 16549 occurring more frequently with Bondenza 150 mg once monthly than with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:
Uncommon (1/ 100 – 1/ 1,000) Gastro-intestinal Disorders:
gastritis, oesophagitis including oesophageal ulcerations or strictures, vomiting, dysphagia
Nervous System Disorders:
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:
dizziness back pain
Rare (1/ 1,000 – 1/ 10,000)
Gastro-intestinal Disorders:
Immune System Disorders:
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:
duodenitis hypersensitivity reactions angioedema, face oedema, urticaria
Patients with a previous history of gastrointestinal disease including patients with peptic ulcer without recent bleeding or hospitalisation, and patients with dyspepsia or reflux controlled by medication were included in the once monthly treatment study.
For these patients, there was no difference in the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events with the 150 mg once monthly regimen compared to the 2.5 mg daily regimen.
Laboratory test findings In the pivotal three-year study with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily (MF 4411) there was no difference compared with placebo for laboratory abnormalities indicative of hepatic or renal dysfunction, an impaired haematologic system, hypocalcaemia or hypophosphataemia.
Similarly, no differences were noted between the groups in study BM 16549 after one and two years.
Post-marketing Experience Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated by bisphosphonates.
The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients, but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is generally associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Diagnosis of cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also deemed as risk factors (see section 4.4).
7 4.9 Overdose
No specific information is available on the treatment of over dosage with Bondenza.
However, based on a knowledge of this class of compounds, oral over-dosage may result in upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions (such as upset stomach, dyspepsia, oesophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer) or hypocalcaemia.
Milk or antacids should be given to bind Bondenza, and any adverse reactions treated symptomatically.
Owing to the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Bisphosphonates, ATC code:
M05B A06
Mechanism of action Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of bisphosphonates, which act selectively on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity without directly affecting bone formation.
It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment.
Ibandronic acid leads to progressive net gains in bone mass and a decreased incidence of fractures through the reduction of elevated bone turnover towards premenopausal levels in postmenopausal women.
Pharmacodynamic effects The pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption.
In vivo, ibandronic acid prevents experimentally induced bone destruction caused by cessation of gonadal function, retinoids, tumours or tumour extracts.
In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is also inhibited, leading to increased normal bone mass compared with untreated animals.
Animal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity.
In growing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralization even at doses greater than 5,000 times the dose required for osteoporosis treatment.
Both daily and intermittent (with prolonged dose-free intervals) long-term administration in rats, dogs and monkeys was associated with formation of new bone of normal quality and maintained or increased mechanical strength even at doses in the toxic range.
In humans, the efficacy of both daily and intermittent administration with a dose-free interval of 9-10 weeks of ibandronic acid was confirmed in a clinical trial (MF 4411), in which ibandronic acid demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy.
In animal models ibandronic acid produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including suppression of urinary biochemical markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX)).
In a Phase 1 bioequivalence study conducted in 72 postmenopausal women receiving 150 mg orally every 28 days for a total of four doses, inhibition in serum CTX following the first dose was seen as early as 24 hours post-dose (median inhibition 28%), with median maximal inhibition (69%) seen 6 days later.
Following the third and fourth dose, the median maximum inhibition 6 days post dose was 74% with reduction to a median inhibition of 56% seen 28 days following the fourth dose.
With no further dosing, there is a loss of suppression of biochemical markers of bone resorption.
Clinical efficacy Independent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fractures, a family history of fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to identify women at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures.
Bondenza 150 mg once monthly
8 Bone mineral density (BMD) Bondenza 150 mg once monthly was shown to be at least as effective as ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily at increasing BMD in a two year, double-blind, multicentre study (BM 16549) of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (lumbar spine BMD T score below -2.5 SD at baseline).
This was demonstrated in both the primary analysis at one year and in the confirmatory analysis at two years endpoint (Table 3).

Furthermore, Bondenza 150 mg once monthly was proven superior to ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily for increases in lumbar spine BMD in a prospectively planned analysis at one year, p=0.002, and at two years, p < 0.001.
At one year (primary analysis), 91.3% (p=0.005) of patients receiving Bondenza 150 mg once monthly had a lumbar spine BMD increase above or equal to baseline (BMD responders), compared with 84.0% of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily.
At two years, 93.5% (p=0.004) and 86.4% of patients receiving Bondenza 150 mg once monthly or ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily, respectively, were responders.
For total hip BMD, 90.0% (p < 0.001) of patients receiving Bondenza 150 mg once monthly and 76.7% of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily had total hip BMD increases above or equal to baseline at one year.
At two years 93.4% (p < 0.001) of patients receiving Bondenza 150 mg once monthly and 78.4%, of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily had total hip BMD increases above or equal to baseline.
When a more stringent criterion is considered, which combines both lumbar spine and total hip BMD, 83.9% (p < 0.001) and 65.7% of patients receiving Bondenza 150 mg once monthly or ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily, respectively, were responders at one year.
At two years, 87.1% (p < 0.001) and 70.5%, of patients met this criterion in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms respectively.
Biochemical markers of bone turn-over Clinically meaningful reductions in serum CTX levels were observed at all time points measured, i. e. months 3, 6, 12 and 24.
After one year (primary analysis) the median relative change from baseline was -76% for Bondenza 150 mg once monthly and -67% for ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily.
At two years the median relative change was -68% and -62%, in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms respectively.
At one year, 83.5% (p= 0.006) of patients receiving Bondenza 150 mg once monthly and 73.9% of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily were identified as responders (defined as a decrease
9 ≥ 50% from baseline).
At two years 78.7% (p=0.002) and 65.6% of patients were identified as responders in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms respectively.
Based on the results of study BM 16549, Bondenza 150 mg once monthly is expected to be at least as effective in preventing fractures as ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily.
Ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily
In the initial three-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fracture study (MF 4411), a statistically significant and medically relevant decrease in the incidence of new radiographic morphometric and clinical vertebral fractures was demonstrated (table 4).
In this study, ibandronic acid was evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently as an exploratory regimen.
Ibandronic acid was taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink of the day (post-dose fasting period).
The study enrolled women aged 55 to 80 years, who were at least 5 years postmenopausal, who had a BMD at lumbar spine of 2 to 5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one vertebra [L1-L4], and who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures.
All patients received 500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily.
Efficacy was evaluated in 2,928 patients. ibandronic acid 2.5 mg administered daily, showed a statistically significant and medically relevant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures.
This regimen reduced the occurrence of new radiographic vertebral fractures by 62% (p=0.0001) over the three year duration of the study.
A relative risk reduction of 61% was observed after 2 years (p=0.0006).
No statistically significant difference was attained after 1 year of treatment (p=0.056).
The anti-fracture effect was consistent over the duration of the study.
There was no indication of a waning of the effect over time.
The incidence of clinical vertebral fractures was also significantly reduced by 49% (p=0.011).
The strong effect on vertebral fractures was furthermore reflected by a statistically significant reduction of height loss compared to placebo (p < 0.0001).

The treatment effect of ibandronic acid was further assessed in an analysis of the subpopulation of patients who at baseline had a lumbar spine BMD T-score below – 2.5.
The vertebral fracture risk reduction was very consistent with that seen in the overall population.

3.59% (3.1, 4.1)
In the overall patient population of the study MF4411, no reduction was observed for non-vertebral fractures, however daily ibandronate appeared to be effective in a high-risk subpopulation (femoral neck BMD T-score < -3.0), where a non-vertebral fracture risk reduction of 69% was observed.
Daily treatment with 2.5 mg resulted in progressive increases in BMD at vertebral and nonvertebral sites of the skeleton.
Three-year lumbar spine BMD increase compared to placebo was 5.3% and 6.5% compared to baseline.
Increases at the hip compared to baseline were 2.8% at the femoral neck, 3.4% at the total hip, and 5.5% at the trochanter.
Biochemical markers of bone turnover (such as urinary CTX and serum Osteocalcin) showed the expected pattern of suppression to premenopausal levels and reached maximum suppression within a period of 3-6 months.
A clinically meaningful reduction of 50% of biochemical markers of bone resorption was observed as early as one month after start of treatment with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg.
Following treatment discontinuation, there is a reversion to the pathological pre-treatment rates of elevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
The histological analysis of bone biopsies after two and three years of treatment of postmenopausal women showed bone of normal quality and no indication of a mineralization defect.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The primary pharmacological effects of ibandronic acid on bone are not directly related to actual plasma concentrations, as demonstrated by various studies in animals and humans.
Absorption The absorption of ibandronic acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration and plasma concentrations increase in a dose-proportional manner up to 50 mg oral intake, with greater than dose-proportional increases seen above this dose.
Maximum observed plasma concentrations were reached within 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in the fasted state and absolute bioavailability was about 0.6%.
The extent of absorption is impaired when taken together with food or beverages (other than plain water).
Bioavailability is reduced by about 90% when ibandronic acid is administered with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability seen in fasted subjects.
There is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability provided ibandronic acid is taken 60 minutes before the first food of the day.
Both bioavailability and BMD gains are reduced when food or beverage is taken less than 60 minutes after ibandronic acid is ingested.
11 Distribution After initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine.
In humans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 l and the amount of dose reaching the bone is estimated to be 40-50% of the circulating dose.
Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 85% - 87% (determined in vitro at therapeutic concentrations), and thus there is a low potential for interaction with other medicinal products due to displacement.
Metabolism There is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolised in animals or humans.
Elimination The absorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is removed from the circulation via bone absorption (estimated to be 40-50% in postmenopausal women) and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by the kidney.
The unabsorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is eliminated unchanged in the faeces.
The range of observed apparent half-lives is broad, the apparent terminal half-life is generally in the range of 10-72 hours.
As the values calculated are largely a function of the duration of study, the dose used, and assay sensitivity, the true terminal half-life is likely to be substantially longer, in common with other bisphosphonates.
Early plasma levels fall quickly reaching 10% of peak values within 3 and 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration respectively.
Total clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range 84-160 ml/ min.
Renal clearance (about 60 mL/ min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50-60% of total clearance and is related to creatinine clearance.
The difference between the apparent total and renal clearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone.
Pharmacokinetics in special clinical situations
Gender Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid are similar in men and women.
Race There is no evidence for any clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences between Asians and Caucasians in ibandronic acid disposition.
There are few data available on patients of African origin.
Patients with renal impairment Renal clearance of ibandronic acid in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly related to creatinine clearance.
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr equal or greater than 30 ml/ min), as shown in study BM 16549 where the majority of patients had mild to moderate renal impairment.
Subjects with severe renal failure (CLcr less than 30 ml/ min) receiving daily oral administration of 10 mg ibandronic acid for 21 days, had 2-3 fold higher plasma concentrations than subjects with normal renal function and total clearance of ibandronic acid was 44 ml/ min.
After intravenous administration of 0.5 mg, total, renal, and non-renal clearances decreased by 67%, 77% and 50%, respectively, in subjects with severe renal failure but there was no reduction in tolerability associated with the increase in exposure.
Due to the limited clinical experience, Bondenza is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2 and section 4.4).
The pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid was not assessed in patients with end-stage renal disease managed by other than hemodialysis.
The pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid in these patients is unknown, and ibandronic acid should not be used under these circumstances.
Patients with hepatic impairment There are no pharmacokinetic data for ibandronic acid in patients who have hepatic impairment.
The liver has no significant role in the clearance of ibandronic acid which is not metabolised but is cleared by renal excretion and by uptake into bone.
Therefore dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with hepatic impairment.
12 Elderly Population In a multivariate analysis, age was not found to be an independent factor of any of the pharmacokinetic parameters studied.
As renal function decreases with age this is the only factor to take into consideration (see renal impairment section).
Paediatric population There are no data on the use of Bondenza in these age groups.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Toxic effects, e. g signs of renal damage, were observed in dogs only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.
Mutagenicity/ Carcinogenicity:
No indication of carcinogenic potential was observed.
Tests for genotoxicity revealed no evidence of genetic activity for ibandronic acid.
Reproductive toxicity:
There was no evidence for a direct foetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid in orally treated rats and rabbits and there were no adverse effects on the development in F1 offspring in rats at an extrapolated exposure of at least 35 times above human exposure.
Adverse effects of ibandronic acid in reproductive toxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class.
They include a decreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase in visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture (see section 5.1).
A reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral neck fractures has not been established.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Posology:
The recommended dose of ibandronic acid is 3 mg, administered as an intravenous injection over 15 - 30 seconds, every three months.
Patients must receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.4 and section 4.5)
If a dose is missed, the injection should be administered as soon as convenient.
Thereafter, injections should be scheduled every 3 months from the date of the last injection.
Special Populations Patients with renal impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment where serum creatinine is equal or below 200 μ mol/ l (2.3 mg/ dl) or where creatinine clearance (measured or estimated) is equal or greater than 30 ml/ min.
Bondenza injection is not recommended for use in patients who have a serum creatinine above 200 μ mol/ l (2.3 mg/ dl) or who have a creatinine clearance (measured or estimated) below 30 ml/ min, because of limited clinical data available from studies including such patients (see section 4.4 and section 5.2)
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).
Elderly Population No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).
15 Paediatric Population There is no relevant use of Bondenza in children, and Bondenza was not studied in the paediatric population.
Method of Administration:
For intravenous use.
Strict adherence to the intravenous administration route is required (see section 4.4).
4.3 Contraindications
- Hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4)
- Hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Administration failures Strict adherence to the intravenous route of administration is required.
Care must be taken not to administer Bondenza injection via intra-arterial or paravenous administration as this could lead to tissue damage.
Hypocalcaemia Bondenza, like other bisphosphonates administered intravenously, may cause a transient decrease in serum calcium values.
Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before starting Bondenza injection therapy.
Other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should also be effectively treated before starting Bondenza injection therapy.
All patients must receive adequate supplemental calcium and vitamin D.
Renal impairment Patients with concomitant diseases, or who use medicinal products which have potential for undesirable effects on the kidney, should be reviewed regularly in line with good medical practice during treatment.
Due to limited clinical experience, Bondenza injection is not recommended for patients with a serum creatinine above 200 μ mol/ l (2.3 mg/ dl) or with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/ min (see section 4.2 and section 5.2).
Osteonecrosis of the jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw, generally associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis) has been reported in patients with cancer receiving treatment regimens including primarily intravenously administered bisphosphonates.
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in patients with osteoporosis receiving oral bisphosphonates.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene).
While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible.
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition.
For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
Clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment.
16 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Metabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats.
Furthermore, plasma protein binding is approximately 85% - 87% (determined in vitro at therapeutic ibandronic acid concentrations), and thus there is a low potential for interaction with other medicinal products due to displacement.
Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not undergo any biotransformation.
The secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the excretion of other active substances.
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in postmenopausal women have demonstrated the absence of any interaction potential with tamoxifen or hormone replacement therapy (oestrogen).
No interaction was observed when co-administered with melphalan/ prednisolone in patients with multiple myeloma.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of ibandronic acid in pregnant women.
Studies in rats have shown some reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Bondenza should not be used during pregnancy.
Lactation It is not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk.
Studies in lactating rats have demonstrated the presence of low levels of ibandronic acid in the milk following intravenous administration.
Bondenza should not be used during lactation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The safety of oral treatment with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg once daily was evaluated in 1251 patients treated in 4 placebo-controlled clinical studies; 73% of these patients came from the pivotal three-year treatment study (MF 4411).
The overall safety profile of ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in all these studies was similar to that of placebo.
The overall proportion of patients who experienced an adverse reaction, i. e. adverse event with a possible or probable relationship to trial medicinal product, in the pivotal treatment study (MF 4411) was 19.8% for ibandronic acid and 17.9% for placebo.
In the pivotal two-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM16550), the overall safety of intravenous injection of Bondenza 3 mg every 3 months and oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily were shown to be similar.
The overall proportion of patients who experienced an adverse reaction was 26.0% and 28.6% for Bondenza 3 mg injection every 3 months and 20.4% and 22.6% for oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily after one year and two years, respectively.
The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity.
Most cases of adverse reactions did not lead to cessation of therapy.
Table 1 and table 2 list adverse events after one year and two years of treatment, respectively, from the pivotal phase III trial BM16550, reported as possibly or probably related to trial medicinal product, in more than 1% of the patients treated with either intravenous injection of Bondenza 3 mg every 3 months or intravenous injection of placebo plus oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily.
Adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Bondenza 3 mg injection at a frequency equal to or less than that in orally treated patients, are not included.
Tables 1 and 2 also show adverse reactions in patients treated for 3 years with oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in the anti-fracture study (MF4411).
For both studies, adverse reactions are listed which occurred with a higher incidence in ibandronic acid -treated
17 patients compared with the placebo-treated patients of study MF4411.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Laboratory test findings In the pivotal three-year study with oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily (MF 4411) there was no difference compared with placebo for laboratory abnormalities indicative of hepatic or renal dysfunction, impaired haematologic system, hypocalcaemia or hypophosphataemia.
Similarly, no differences were noted between the groups in the pivotal study with Bondenza 3 mg injection every 3 months (BM 16550).
Post-marketing Experience Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in patients treated by bisphosphonates.
The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients, but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is generally associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis).
Diagnosis of cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also deemed as risk factors (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Bondenza.
Based on knowledge of this class of compounds, intravenous overdosage may result in hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, and hypomagnesaemia.
Clinically relevant reductions in serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium should be corrected by intravenous administration of calcium gluconate, potassium or sodium phosphate, and magnesium sulfate, respectively.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Bisphosphonates, ATC code:
M05B A06
Mechanism of action Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of bisphosphonates, which act selectively on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity without directly affecting bone formation.
It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment.
Ibandronic acid leads to progressive net gains in bone mass and a decreased incidence of fractures through the reduction of elevated bone turnover towards premenopausal levels in postmenopausal women.
Pharmacodynamic effects The pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption.
In vivo, ibandronic acid prevents bone destruction experimentally induced by cessation of gonadal function, retinoids, tumours or tumour extracts.
In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is also inhibited, leading to increased normal bone mass compared with untreated animals.
Animal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity.
In growing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralisation even at doses greater than 5,000 times the dose required for osteoporosis treatment.
Both daily and intermittent (with prolonged dose-free intervals) long-term administration in rats, dogs and monkeys was associated with formation of new bone of normal quality and maintained or
20 increased mechanical strength even at doses in the toxic range.
In humans, the efficacy of both daily and intermittent administration with a dose-free interval of 9 - 10 weeks of ibandronic acid was confirmed in a clinical trial (MF 4411), in which ibandronic acid demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy.
In animal models ibandronic acid produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including suppression of urinary biochemical markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX)).
Both daily, intermittent (with a dose-free interval of 9 - 10 weeks per quarter) oral doses as well as intravenous doses of ibandronic acid in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption.
Bondenza intravenous injection decreased levels of serum C-telopeptide of the alpha chain of Type I collagen (CTX) within 3 - 7 days of starting treatment and decreased levels of osteocalcin within 3 months.
Following treatment discontinuation, there is a reversion to the pathological pre-treatment rates of elevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
The histological analysis of bone biopsies after two and three years of treatment of postmenopausal women with doses of oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily and intermittent intravenous doses of up to 1 mg every 3 months showed bone of normal quality and no indication of a mineralisation defect.
An expected decrease in bone turnover, normal quality of bone and absence of defects in mineralization were also seen after two years of treatment with Bondenza 3 mg injection.
Clinical efficacy Independent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fractures, a family history of fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to identify women at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures.
Bondenza 3 mg injection every 3 months
Bone mineral density (BMD)
Bondenza 3 mg intravenous injection, administered every 3 months, was shown to be at least as effective as oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in a 2-year, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non- inferiority study (BM16550) of postmenopausal women (1386 women aged 55 - 80) with osteoporosis (lumbar spine BMD T-score below -2.5 SD at baseline).
This was demonstrated in both the primary analysis at one year and in the confirmatory analysis at two years endpoint (Table 3).
The primary analysis of data from study BM16550 at one year and the confirmatory analysis at 2 years demonstrated the non-inferiority of 3 mg every 3 months injection dosing regimen compared to 2.5 mg oral daily dosing regimen, in terms of mean increases in BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and trochanter (Table 3).

Furthermore, Bondenza 3 mg injection every 3 months was proven superior to oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily for increases in lumbar spine BMD in a prospectively planned analysis at one year, p < 0.001, and at two years, p < 0.001.
For lumbar spine BMD, 92.1% of patients receiving 3 mg injection every 3 months increased or maintained their BMD after 1 year of treatment (i. e. were responders) compared with 84.9% of patients receiving oral 2.5 mg daily (p=0.002).
After 2 years of treatment, 92.8% of patients receiving 3 mg injections and 84.7% of patient receiving 2.5 mg oral therapy had increased or maintained lumbar spine BMD (p=0.001).
For total hip BMD, 82.3% of patients receiving 3 mg injection every 3 months were responders at one year, compared with 75.1% of patients receiving 2.5 mg daily orally (p=0.02).
After 2 years of treatment, 85.6% of patients receiving 3 mg injections and 77.0% of patient receiving 2.5 mg oral therapy had increased or maintained total hip BMD (p=0.004).
The proportion of patients who increased or maintained their BMD at one year at both lumbar spine and total hip was 76.2% in the 3 mg injection every 3 months arm and 67.2% in the 2.5 mg daily orally arm (p=0.007).
At two years, 80.1% and 68.8% of patients met this criterion in the 3 mg every 3 months injection arm and the 2.5 mg daily arm (p=0.001).
Biochemical markers of bone turn-over
Clinically meaningful reductions in serum CTX levels were observed at all time points measured.
At 12 months median relative changes from baseline were – 58.6% for the intravenous injection of 3 mg every 3 months regimen and – 62.6% for oral 2.5 mg daily regimen.
In addition, 64.8% of patients receiving 3 mg every 3 months injection were identified as responders (defined as a decrease ≥ 50% from baseline), compared with 64.9% of patients receiving 2.5 mg daily orally.
Serum CTX reduction was maintained over the 2 years, with more than half of the patients identified as responders in both treatment groups.
Based on the results of study BM 16550, Bondenza 3 mg intravenous injection, administered every 3 months is expected to be at least as effective in preventing fractures as the oral regimen of ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily.
22 Ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily tablets
In the initial three-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fracture study (MF 4411), a statistically significant and medically relevant decrease in the incidence of new radiographic morphometric and clinical vertebral fractures was demonstrated (table 4).
In this study, ibandronic acid was evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently as an exploratory regimen.
Ibandronic acid was taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink of the day (post-dose fasting period).
The study enrolled women aged 55 to 80 years, who were at least 5 years postmenopausal, who had a BMD at the lumbar spine of -2 to -5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one vertebra [L1-L4], and who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures.
All patients received 500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily.
Efficacy was evaluated in 2,928 patients.
Ibandronic acid 2.5 mg administered daily, showed a statistically significant and medically relevant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures.
This regimen reduced the occurrence of new radiographic vertebral fractures by 62% (p=0.0001) over the three year duration of the study.
A relative risk reduction of 61% was observed after 2 years (p=0.0006).
No statistically significant difference was attained after 1 year of treatment (p=0.056).
The anti-fracture effect was consistent over the duration of the study.
There was no indication of a waning of the effect over time.
The incidence of clinical vertebral fractures was also significantly reduced by 49% after 3 years (p=0.011).
The strong effect on vertebral fractures was furthermore reflected by a statistically significant reduction of height loss compared to placebo (p < 0.0001).

The treatment effect of ibandronic acid was further assessed in an analysis of the subpopulation of patients who, at baseline, had a lumbar spine BMD T-score below – 2.5 (table 5).
The vertebral fracture risk reduction was very consistent with that seen in the overall population.

In the overall patient population of the study MF4411, no reduction was observed for non-vertebral fractures, however daily ibandronate appeared to be effective in a high-risk subpopulation (femoral neck BMD T-score < -3.0), where a non-vertebral fracture risk reduction of 69% was observed.
Daily oral treatment with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg tablets resulted in progressive increases in BMD at vertebral and nonvertebral sites of the skeleton.
Three-year lumbar spine BMD increase compared to placebo was 5.3% and 6.5% compared to baseline.
Increases at the hip compared to baseline were 2.8% at the femoral neck, 3.4% at the total hip, and 5.5% at the trochanter.
Biochemical markers of bone turnover (such as urinary CTX and serum Osteocalcin) showed the expected pattern of suppression to premenopausal levels and reached maximum suppression within a period of 3 - 6 months of using 2.5 mg ibandronic acid daily.
A clinically meaningful reduction of 50% of biochemical markers of bone resorption was observed as early as one month after starting treatment with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The primary pharmacological effects of ibandronic acid on bone are not directly related to actual plasma concentrations, as demonstrated by various studies in animals and humans.
Plasma concentrations of ibandronic acid increase in a dose-proportional manner after intravenous administration of 0.5 mg to 6 mg.
Absorption Not applicable
Distribution After initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine.
In humans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 l and the amount of dose reaching the bone is estimated to be 40 – 50% of the circulating dose.
Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 85% - 87% (determined in vitro at therapeutic ibandronic acid concentrations), and thus there is a low potential for interaction with other medicinal products due to displacement.
Metabolism There is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolised in animals or humans.
Elimination Ibandronic acid is removed from the circulation via bone absorption (estimated to be 40 – 50% in postmenopausal women) and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by the kidney.
The range of observed apparent half-lives is broad, the apparent terminal half-life is generally in the range of 10 - 72 hours.
As the values calculated are largely a function of the duration of study, the dose used, and assay sensitivity, the true terminal half-life is likely to be substantially longer, in common with other bisphosphonates.
Early plasma levels fall quickly, reaching 10% of the peak values within 3 and 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration, respectively.
24 Total clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range 84 - 160 ml/ min.
Renal clearance (about 60 ml/ min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50 – 60% of total clearance, and is related to creatinine clearance.
The difference between the apparent total and renal clearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone.
Pharmacokinetics in special clinical situations
Gender Pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid are similar in men and women.
Race There is no evidence for any clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences between Asians and Caucasians in ibandronic acid disposition.
There is limited data available on patients of African origin.
Patients with renal impairment Renal clearance of ibandronic acid in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly related to creatinine clearance (CLcr).
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr equal or above 30 ml/ min).
Subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 ml/ min) receiving daily oral administration of 10 mg ibandronic acid for 21 days, had 2 - 3 fold higher plasma concentrations than subjects with normal renal function and total clearance of ibandronic acid was 44 ml/ min.
After intravenous administration of 0.5 mg of ibandronic acid, total, renal, and non-renal clearances decreased by 67%, 77% and 50%, respectively, in subjects with severe renal failure, but there was no reduction in tolerability associated with the increase in exposure.
Due to the limited clinical experience, Bondenza is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2 and section 4.4).
The pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid in patients with end-stage renal disease was only assessed in a small number of patients managed by haemodialysis, therefore, the pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid in the patients not undergoing haemodialysis is unknown.
Due to the limited data available, ibandronic acid should not be used in all patients with end-stage renal disease.
Patients with hepatic impairment There are no pharmacokinetic data for ibandronic acid in patients who have hepatic impairment.
The liver has no significant role in the clearance of ibandronic acid, which is not metabolised but is cleared by renal excretion and by uptake into bone.
Therefore dose adjustment is not necessary in patients with hepatic impairment.
Elderly Population In a multivariate analysis, age was not found to be an independent factor of any of the pharmacokinetic parameters studied.
As renal function decreases with age, renal function is the only factor to take into consideration (see renal impairment section).
Paediatric Population There are no data on the use of Bondenza in these age groups.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Toxic effects, e. g. signs of renal damage, were observed in dogs only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure, indicating little relevance to clinical use.
Mutagenicity/ Carcinogenicity:
No indication of carcinogenic potential was observed.
Tests for genotoxicity revealed no evidence of genetic activity for ibandronic acid.
25 Reproductive toxicity:
Specific studies for the 3-monthly dosing regimen have not been performed.
In studies with daily i. v. dosing regimen, there was no evidence for a direct foetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid in rats and rabbits.
Body weight gain was decreased in F1 offspring in rats.
Other adverse reactions to ibandronic acid in reproductive toxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class.
They include a decreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase in visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome).

WHAT BONDENZA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Bondenza belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates.
It contains ibandronic acid.
It does not contain hormones.
Bondenza may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing bone mass in most women who take it, even though they won’t be able to see or feel a difference.
Bondenza may help lower the chances of breaking bones (fractures).
This reduction in fractures was shown for the spine but not for the hip.
Bondenza is prescribed to you to treat osteoporosis because you have an increased risk of fractures.
Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones, which is common in women after the menopause.
At the menopause, a woman’s ovaries stop producing the female hormone, oestrogen, which helps to keep her skeleton healthy.
The earlier a woman reaches the menopause, the greater her risk of fractures in osteoporosis.
Other things that can increase the risk of fractures include:
- not enough calcium and vitamin D in the diet
- smoking, or drinking too much alcohol
- not enough w alking or other weight-bearing exercise
- a family history of osteoporosis
Many people with osteoporosis have no symptoms.
If you have no symptoms you may not know if you have the condition.
However, osteoporosis makes you more likely to break bones if you fall or hurt yourself.
A broken bone after the age of 50 may be a sign of osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis can also cause back pain, height loss and a curved back.
Bondenza prevents loss of bone from osteoporosis, and helps to rebuild bone.
Therefore Bondenza makes bone less likely to break.
40 A healthy lifestyle will also help you to get the most benefit from your treatment.
This includes eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D; walking or any other weight-bearing exercise; not smoking; and not drinking too much alcohol.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE BONDENZA
Do not take Bondenza
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to ibandronic acid, or to any of the other ingredients of
Bondenza.
- If you have, or had in the past low blood calcium.
Please consult your doctor.
Do not give Bondenza to children or adolescents.
Take special care with Bondenza Some people need to be especially careful while they’re taking Bondenza.
Check with your doctor:
- If you have any disturbances of mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency).
- If you can’t stand or sit upright for up to an hour at a time.
- If your kidneys are not functioning normally.
- If you have ever had problems with your oesophagus (the tube connecting your mouth to your
stomach).
Problems in your oesophagus might give you symptoms including: severe pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting.
If you develop these symptoms, speak to your doctor straight away.
- If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are
being treated with Bondenza.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without prescription.
Especially:
- Supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium, as they could possibly
influence the effects of Bondenza.
- Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) (including
ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium and naproxen) may irritate the stomach and intestine.
Bisphosphonates (like Bondenza) may also do so.
So be especially careful if you take painkillers or anti-inflammatories while you’re taking Bondenza.
After swallowing your monthly Bondenza tablet, wait for 1 hour before taking any other medication, including indigestion tablets, calcium supplements, or vitamins.
Taking Bondenza with food and drink:
Do not take Bondenza with food.
Bondenza is less effective if it’s taken with food.
You can drink plain water but no other drinks (see 3.
HOW TO TAKE BONDENZA).
Pregnancy and breast feeding Do not take Bondenza if you’re pregnant or breast feeding.
If you’re breast feeding, you may need to stop in order to take Bondenza.
Driving and using machines You can drive and use machines as it’s very unlikely that Bondenza will affect your ability to drive and use machines.
41 Important information about some of the ingredients of Bondenza Bondenza contains an ingredient called lactose.
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
3.
HOW TO TAKE BONDENZA
Always take Bondenza exactly as your doctor has told you.
If you’re not sure about anything, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
The usual dose of Bondenza is one tablet once a month.
Taking your monthly tablet It’s important to follow these instructions carefully.
They are designed to help your Bondenza tablet reach your stomach quickly, so it’s less likely to cause irritation.
- Take one Bondenza 150 mg tablet once a month.
- Choose one day of the month that will be easy to remember.
You can choose either the same
date (such as the 1st of each month) or the same day (such as the first Sunday of each month) to take your Bondenza tablet.
Choose the date that best fits your routine.
- Take your Bondenza tablet at least 6 hours after you last had anything to eat or drink except
plain water.
- Take your Bondenza tablet
- -
after you first get up for the day, and before you have anything to eat or drink (on an empty stomach)
- Swallow your tablet with a full glass of plain water (at least 180 ml).
Do not take your tablet with mineral water, fruit juice or any other drinks.
- Swallow your tablet whole — do not chew it, crush it or let it dissolve in your mouth.
- For the next hour (60 minutes) after you’ve taken your tablet
-
do not lie down; if you do not stay upright (standing or sitting), some of the medicine could leak back into your oesophagus
-
do not eat anything
- -
do not drink anything (except plain water if you need it) do not take any other medicines
- After you’ve waited for an hour, you can have your first food and drink of the day.
Once you’ve
eaten, it’s OK to lie down if you wish, and to take any other medication you need.
Do not take your tablet at bedtime or before you get up for the day.
42 Continuing to take Bondenza It’s important to keep taking Bondenza every month, as long as your doctor prescribes it for you.
Bondenza can treat osteoporosis only as long as you keep taking it.
If you take too much Bondenza If you’ve taken more than one tablet by mistake, drink a full glass of milk and talk to your doctor straight away.
Do not make yourself vomit, and do not lie down — this could cause Bondenza to irritate your oesophagus.
If you forget a dose If you forget to take your tablet on the morning of your chosen day, do not take a tablet later in the day.
Instead, consult your calendar and find out when your next scheduled dose is:
If your next scheduled dose is only 1 to 7 days away… You should wait until the next scheduled dose is due and take it as normal; then, continue taking one tablet once a month on the scheduled days you’ve marked on your calendar.
If your next scheduled dose is more than 7 days away… You should take one tablet the next morning after the day you remember; then, continue taking one tablet once a month on the scheduled days you’ve marked on your calendar.
Never take two Bondenza tablets within the same week.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Bondenza can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
These side effects may occur with certain frequencies, which are defined as follows:
- very common: affects more than 1 user in 10
- common: affects 1 to 10 users in 100
- uncommon: affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000
- rare: affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000
- very rare: affects less than 1 user in 10,000
- not known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data.
Common side effects are heartburn, indigestion, diarrhoea, stomach ache, nausea and flatulence.
Other common side effects include rash, cramps in the muscles, pain in the muscles and joints, and headache.
It also includes flu-like symptoms (aches, pain, feeling of discomfort, fatigue) which are usually mild, are short-lasting and disappear soon after you have taken the first dose..So you should be able to carry on taking Bondenza.
Talk to your doctor if any effects become troublesome or last a long time.
Bondenza can irritate the oesophagus, although you can usually avoid this by taking your dose as described in this leaflet.
These are uncommon side effects, but if you develop symptoms such as severe pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting, tell your doctor straight away.
Other uncommon side effects are dizziness and back pain.
Rare side effects are swelling and itching of the face, lips and mouth.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

1.
WHAT BONDENZA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Bondenza belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates.
It contains ibandronic acid.
It does not contain hormones.
Bondenza may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing bone mass in most women who take it, even though they won’t be able to see or feel a difference.
Bondenza may help lower the chances of breaking bones (fractures).
This reduction in fractures was shown for the spine but not for the hip.
Bondenza 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringes is a solution for intravenous injection by a health care professional.
Do not inject Bondenza yourself.
Bondenza is prescribed to you to treat osteoporosis because you have an increased risk of fractures.
Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones, which is common in women after the menopause.
At the menopause, a woman’s ovaries stop producing the female hormone, oestrogen, which helps to keep her skeleton healthy.
The earlier a woman reaches the menopause, the greater her risk of fractures in osteoporosis.
Other things that can increase the risk of fractures include:
- not enough calcium and vitamin D in the diet
- smoking cigarettes, or drinking too much alcohol
- not enough w alking or other weight-bearing exercise
- a family history of osteoporosis
Many people with osteoporosis have no symptoms.
If you have no symptoms you may not know if you have the condition.
However, osteoporosis makes you more likely to break bones if you fall or hurt yourself.
A broken bone after the age of 50 may be a sign of osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis can also cause back pain, height loss and a curved back.
Bondenza prevents loss of bone from osteoporosis, thus helping to rebuild lost bone.
Therefore, Bondenza makes bones less likely to break.
48 A healthy lifestyle will also help you to get the most benefit from your treatment.
This includes eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, walking or other weight-bearing exercise, not smoking and not drinking too much alcohol.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE BONDENZA
Do not use Bondenza
- if you have, or had in the past, low blood calcium.
Please consult your doctor
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to ibandronic acid or any of the other ingredients in
Bondenza injection
Take special care with Bondenza Some patients need to be especially careful when using Bondenza.
Tell your doctor:
- if you have or have ever had kidney problems, kidney failure or have needed dialysis, or if you
have any other disease that may affect your kidneys
- if you have any disturbance of mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency)
- You should take calcium and vitamin-D supplements while receiving Bondenza.
If you are
unable to do so, you should inform your doctor.
- If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are
being treated with Bondenza.
Taking other medicines Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines.
Mention to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist anything you are taking which you bought over the counter, without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding You should not be given Bondenza if you are pregnant, or if there is a possibility you may become pregnant.
If you are breast-feeding, you will need to stop breast-feeding in order to receive Bondenza.
Driving and using machines You can drive and use machines as it’s very unlikely that Bondenza will affect your ability to drive and use machines.
3.
HOW TO USE BONDENZA
The recommended dose of Bondenza for the intravenous injection is 3 mg (1 pre-filled syringe) once every 3 months.
The injection should be given into the vein by a physician or qualified/trained health care worker.
Do not administer the injection to yourself.
The solution for injection must be administered into a vein only, and not anywhere else in the body.
Continuing to use Bondenza To get the most benefit from the treatment it is important to continue receiving the injections every 3 months for as long as your doctor prescribes it for you.
Bondenza can treat osteoporosis only for as long as you keep receiving the treatment, even though you will not be able to see or feel a difference.
You should also take calcium and vitamin-D supplements, as recommended by your doctor.
49 If too much Bondenza is given You may develop low levels of calcium, phosphorus or magnesium in the blood.
Your doctor may take steps to correct such changes and may give you an injection containing these minerals.
If a dose of Bondenza is missed You should arrange an appointment to get the next injection as soon as possible.
After that, go back to getting the injections every 3 months from the date of the most recent injection.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Bondenza can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
These side effects may occur with certain frequencies, which are defined as follows:
- very common: affects more than 1 user in 10
- common: affects 1 to 10 users in 100
- uncommon: affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000
- rare: affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000
- very rare: affects less than 1 user in 10,000
- not known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data.
Bondenza, like other similar medicines, may cause a drop in the levels of calcium in your blood.
Very common side effects are mild symptoms which start within 1 day of the first injection.
About half (1 in 20) experience aches or pains in the muscles, bones or joints.
The other half may have flu-like symptoms (fever, chills or feverishness and aches or pains in the muscles, bones and joints).
In most cases these symptoms are mild and will not need any treatment.
Taking paracetamol may help relieve these symptoms.
The symptoms should go away quickly (within 2-3 days of the injection) and they do not usually come back after the second injection.
If they do occur after the second injection, they will usually be milder and will usually go away completely after the third or later injection.
Other common side effects are:
- headache
- fatigue
- rash
- diarrhoea
Uncommon side effects are skin reactions at the injection site, such as redness, pain and swelling.
Rare side effects are swelling of the face, lips and mouth may occur.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

INFORMATION FOR THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS
Please see the Summary of Product Characteristics for more information.
Administration of Bondenza 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe:
Bondenza 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe should be injected intravenously over a period of 15 - 30 seconds.
The solution is irritant, therefore strict adherence to the intravenous route of administration is important.
If you inadvertently inject into the tissues around the vein, patients may experience local irritation, pain and inflammation at the injection site.
Bondenza 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe must not be mixed with calcium-containing solutions (such as Ringer-Lactate solution, calcium heparin) or other intravenously administered medicinal products.
Where Bondenza is administered via an existing intravenous infusion line, the intravenous infusate should be restricted to either isotonic saline or 50 mg/ml (5%) glucose solution.
Missed dose:
If a dose is missed, the injection should be administered as soon as convenient.
Thereafter, injections should be scheduled every 3 months from the date of the last injection.
Overdose:
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Bondenza.
Based on knowledge of this class of compounds, intravenous overdosage may result in hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, and hypomagnesaemia, which can cause paraesthesia.
In severe cases intravenous infusion of appropriate doses of calcium gluconate, potassium or sodium phosphate, and magnesium sulfate, may be needed.
General advice:
Bondenza 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe like other bisphosphonates administered intravenously, may cause a transient decrease in serum calcium values.
Hypocalcaemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be assessed and effectively treated before starting Bondenza injection therapy.
Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in all patients.
All patients must receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D.
Patients with concomitant diseases, or who use medicinal products which have a potential for undesirable effects on the kidney, should be reviewed regularly in line with good medical practice during treatment.
Any unused solution for injection, syringe and injection needle should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
53 ANNEX IV
GROUNDS FOR ONE ADDITIONAL RENEWAL
54 GROUNDS FOR ONE ADDITIONAL RENEWAL
Based upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of Bondenza remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons:
The effects of Bisphosphonates as a class, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical stress fractures require a review and continuous monitoring and assessment.
Considering the safety profile of Bondenza and the large number of patients currently enrolled in clinical and post marketing studies for the product as well as the ongoing post-marketing obligations and the continued reports of adverse events received by the MAH, the safety profile will continue to be monitored closely and updates should be provided regularly to the CHMP through 1-yearly PSURs.
Therefore, considering the safety profile of Bondenza, which requires the submission of 1-yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time.
