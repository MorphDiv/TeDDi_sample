The Kipi Raw Image Converter plugin is a conversion tool for raw format images.
KDE
Kipi
Introduction
With this Kipi-plugin you can import/ convert your images stored in RAW format to three formats of your choice (JPEG, TIFF, PPM).
Some considerations before your convert, and even before you shoot in raw format. RAW image file formats keep the original information of the exposure supposedly without loss (when compressed, they use reversible, lossless compressions algorithms). Many photographers prefer to take their picture in RAW mode because the camera's built-in conversion program is often less good then what you can achieve with digital image processing. The whitebalance of the digital camera is registered but not applied to the image. Some CMOS CCD's create four color filter data, RGBG, Red, Green, Blue and another Green mask for contrast enhancement. The plugin can take this into account.
The conversion is actually based on Dave Coffin's command line tool dcraw (Dave: "Do n't expect dcraw to produce the same images as software provided by the camera vendor. Sometimes dcraw gives better results!").
Single Conversion Dialog
Select the RAW file to convert and open the plugin from the host application. The Raw Image Converter window in single mode will appear. Click on Preview to show the effect of your settings taking shape.
Now you can adjust the available check and value boxes to optimise the conversion process. The first checkbox indicates to use the camera settings for white balance. The essential parameters like brightness, and red/ blue amplifier may be adjusted. If the result is not quite optimal, do n't worry, it is always possible to finetune the image later on.
A Four color RGBG conversion can be selected to use contrast information. (If your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG setting has no effect).
If you're happy with the preview, choose one of three output formats to save the conversion result. The file name will stay the same, the extension only changes. JPEG uses the lossy algorithm and produces the smallest output file size.
The tagged image format (TIFF) preserves all information of your image whilst using lossless LZW compression.
The Portable PixMap format (PPM) produces the largest output file and contains most data.
If you intend to work a lot on your images or if it is likely that you have to reuse it later on, then do n't use JPEG format because it allows a limited number of operations only before it deterioates visibly. TIFF and PPM are better suited to keep the original data.
If you choose JPEG as Save Format then the meta-data included in RAW file will be included in the JPEG files like Exif information.
When you have finished click the Process button to start the conversion. If you want abort image conversion, press Abort button.

Batch Conversion Dialog
The batch mode converter allows you to convert several images in one go. Use this mode when you're are sure of the best settings, i. e. try it out in single conversion mode first.
The available setting are mostly identical to the single mode dialog. Here you have the additional option to overwrite existing files (which you might have created in an earlier try). The preview option is not available here. A progress bar indicate the conversion status in live.
