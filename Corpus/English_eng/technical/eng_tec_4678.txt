result_id is a valid result id (select type queries only, and only if a "scrollable "cursor was requested when calling sesam_query()).
whence sets the global default value for the scrolling type, it specifies the scroll type to use in subsequent fetch operations on "scrollable" cursors, which can be set to the following predefined constants:
