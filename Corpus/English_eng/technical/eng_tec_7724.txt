requested position/size for CRTC %d is outside the allowed limit: position=(%d, %d), size=(%d, %d), maximum=(%d, %d)
could not set the configuration for CRTC %d
could not get information about CRTC %d
none of the saved display configurations matched the active configuration
CRTC %d cannot drive output %s
output %s does not support mode %dx%d@%dHz
CRTC %d does not support rotation=%s
output %s does not have the same parameters as another cloned output:
existing mode = %d, new mode = %d
existing coordinates = (%d, %d), new coordinates = (%d, %d)
existing rotation = %s, new rotation = %s
cannot clone to output %s
Trying modes for CRTC %d
CRTC %d: trying mode %dx%d@%dHz with output at %dx%d@%dHz (pass %d)
could not assign CRTCs to outputs:
%s
none of the selected modes were compatible with the possible modes:
%s
required virtual size does not fit available size: requested=(%d, %d), minimum=(%d, %d), maximum=(%d, %d)
Requested size (%d, %d) exceeds 3D hardware limit (%d, %d).
You must either rearrange the displays so that they fit within a (%d, %d) square.
