EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
OSSEOR
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is OSSEOR?
OSSEOR is a medicine containing the active substance strontium ranelate.
It is available as 2-g sachets containing yellow granules, which are made up into an oral suspension.
What is OSSEOR used for?
OSSEOR is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile) in postmenopausal women to reduce the risk of vertebral (spine) and hip fractures.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is OSSEOR used?
OSSEOR is taken as one sachet once a day.
The contents of the sachet are made up into a suspension in a glass of water and drunk just after being prepared.
OSSEOR should be taken at least two hours after food, milk, milk products or calcium supplements, preferably at bedtime.
OSSEOR is intended for long-term use.
Patients should receive calcium or vitamin D supplements if they are not getting enough from their diet.
How does OSSEOR work?
Osteoporosis happens when not enough new bone grows to replace the bone that is naturally broken down.
Gradually, the bones become thin and fragile, and more likely to break (fracture).
Osteoporosis is more common in women after the menopause, when the levels of the female hormone oestrogen fall.
The active substance in OSSEOR, strontium ranelate, acts on the bone structure.
Once in the gut, strontium ranelate releases strontium, which is similar to calcium and, like calcium, is absorbed into the bone.
The mechanism of action of strontium is not fully understood but it stimulates bone formation and reduces bone breakdown.
How has OSSEOR been studied?
OSSEOR has been studied in almost 7,000 postmenopausal elderly women in two large studies.
Nearly a quarter of the patients were over 80 years of age.
The first study included 1,649 women with osteoporosis who already had vertebral fractures and the second included over 5,000 women whose osteoporosis affected the hip region in the thighbone.
In both studies, the effects of OSSEOR were compared with those of placebo (a dummy treatment).
The main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of patients who, over three years, developed a new vertebral (spine) fracture in the first study, or a new osteoporosis peripheral fracture (at any site other than the spine) in the second study.

In the first study, OSSEOR was more effective than placebo in reducing the risk of new vertebral fractures.
The risk was reduced by 41% over three years, with 21% of the 719 women who took OSSEOR developing a new vertebral fracture, compared with 33% of those 723 who took placebo.
Overall, the results of the second study taken alone were insufficient to demonstrate a benefit of OSSEOR in preventing peripheral fractures.
When looking only at women of 74 years of age or older with particularly weak thighbones, the results suggested a reduction of the risk of hip fractures with OSSEOR.
When looking at results of the two studies taken together, fewer women in the OSSEOR group developed peripheral osteoporosis fractures at any site (including the hip) than in the placebo group (331 out of 3,295 with OSSEOR compared with 389 out of 3,256 for placebo).
This showed that the risk of fracture is reduced.
What is the risk associated with OSSEOR?
The most common side effects with OSSEOR (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, loose stools, dermatitis (skin reactions) and eczema (flaky skin rash).
For the full list of all side effects reported with OSSEOR, see the Package Leaflet.
OSSEOR should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to strontium ranelate or any of the other ingredients.
Why has OSSEOR been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that OSSEOR’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis to reduce the risk of vertebral and hip fractures.
The Committee recommended that OSSEOR be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about OSSEOR:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union to LES LABORATORIES SERVIER for OSSEOR on 21 September 2004.
