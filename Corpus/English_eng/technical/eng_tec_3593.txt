(PHP 4)
The localtime() function returns an array identical to that of the structure returned by the C function call.
The first argument to localtime() is the timestamp, if this is not given the current time is used.
The second argument to the localtime() is the is_associative, if this is set to 0 or not supplied than the array is returned as a regular, numerically indexed array.
If the argument is set to 1 then localtime() is an associative array containing all the different elements of the structure returned by the C function call to localtime.
The names of the different keys of the associative array are as follows:
"tm_sec" - seconds
"tm_min" - minutes
"tm_hour" - hour
"tm_mday" - day of the month
"tm_mon" - month of the year, starting with 0 for January
"tm_year" - Years since 1900
"tm_wday" - Day of the week
"tm_yday" - Day of the year
"tm_isdst" - Is daylight savings time in effect
