(PHP 4)
Returns a string with backslashes before characters that are listed in charlist Returns a string with backslashes before characters that are listed in charlist parameter.
It escapes \n, \r etc. in C-like style, characters with ASCII code lower than 32 and higher than 126 are converted to octal representation.
Be careful if you choose to escape characters 0, a, b, f, n, r, t and v.
They will be converted to \0, \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, and \v.
In PHP \0 (NULL), \r (carriage return), \n (newline) and (tab) are predefined escape sequences, while in C all of these are predefined escape sequences.
charlist like "\0..\37", which would escape all characters with ASCII code between 0 and 31.
Example 1. addcslashes() example
$escaped = addcslashes( $not_escaped, "\0..\37!@\177..\377");
When you define a sequence of characters in the charlist argument make sure that you know what characters come between the characters that you set as the start and end of the range.
echo addcslashes( 'foo []', 'A..z'); / / output: \f\o\o\ [\] / / All upper and lower-case letters will be escaped / /... but so will the [\ ]^_` and any tabs, line / / feeds, carriage returns, etc.
echo addcslashes( "zoo[' .']", 'z..A'); / / output: \zoo['\ .']
