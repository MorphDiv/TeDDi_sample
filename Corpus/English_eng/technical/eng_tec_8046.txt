EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
KIVEXA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Kivexa?
Kivexa is a medicine that contains two active substances, abacavir (600 mg) and lamivudine (300 mg).
It is available as orange capsule-shaped tablets.
What is Kivexa used for?
Kivexa is an antiviral medicine.
It is used in combination with at least one other antiviral medicine to treat adults and adolescents over 12 years old who are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Kivexa used?
Kivexa should be prescribed by a doctor who has experience in the management of HIV infection.
Kivexa is taken as one tablet once a day, with or without food.
The medicine should only be given to patients who weigh over 40 kg.
Patients requiring dose adjustments of abacavir or lamivudine should take the medicines separately.
Kivexa should not be given to patients who have severe problems with their liver and is not recommended for patients who have severe problems with their kidneys.
Patients with mild or moderate problems with their liver should be monitored closely by their doctor.
Kivexa should be used with caution in patients over 65 years of age.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
Patients who take Kivexa must be given the special alert card that summarises the key safety information about the medicine.
How does Kivexa work?
Both active substances in Kivexa, abacavir and lamivudine, are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
They both work in similar ways by blocking the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme produced by HIV that allows it to infect cells and make more viruses.
Kivexa, taken in combination with at least one other antiviral medicine, reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.
Kivexa does not cure HIV infection or AIDS, but it may delay the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.
Both active substances have been available in the European Union (EU) since the late 1990s: abacavir was granted marketing approval as Ziagen in 1999, and lamivudine was granted marketing authorisation as Epivir in 1996.

Kivexa has been studied in three main studies involving 1,230 patients.
At the time of Kivexa’ s approval, abacavir was authorised at a dose of 300 mg twice a day.
Therefore, the studies compared abacavir taken at 600 mg once a day and at 300 mg twice a day, in combination with lamivudine and one or two other antiviral medicines.
Two studies used the active substances taken as separate medicines, while the third used a combination tablet for the once-daily dose.
The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the level of HIV in the blood (viral load) after 24 or 48 weeks of treatment.
What benefit has Kivexa shown during the study?
Both doses of abacavir, taken in combination with lamivudine and other antiviral medicines, were equally effective in reducing viral loads.
In the first study, 253 (66%) of the 384 patients taking abacavir once a day had viral loads below 50 copies/ ml after 48 weeks, compared to 261 (68%) of the 386 taking it twice a day.
The combination tablet taken once a day was also as effective as the medicines taken separately twice a day in reducing viral loads over 24 weeks of treatment.
What is the risk associated with Kivexa?
The most common side effects when taking Kivexa (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are hypersensitivity (allergic reactions), rash, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal (tummy) pain, headache, arthralgia (joint pain), muscle disorders, cough, nasal symptoms, fever, lethargy, fatigue (tiredness), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), malaise (feeling unwell), anorexia (loss of appetite) and alopecia (hair loss).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Kivexa, see the Package Leaflet.
Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions) occur in about 5% of patients taking Kivexa, usually within the first six weeks of treatment.
Some of these cases can be fatal.
Symptoms almost always include fever or rash, but also very commonly include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), cough, lethargy, malaise, headache, signs of liver damage in the blood and myalgia (muscle pain).
Patients treated with Kivexa receive a card detailing these symptoms so that they are aware of them, and must contact their doctor immediately if they develop a reaction.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
Kivexa should not be used in patients with severe liver disease or in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to lamivudine, abacavir or any of the other ingredients.
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Kivexa may be at risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).
Patients who have problems with their liver (including hepatitis B or C infection) may be at an elevated risk of liver damage when taking Kivexa.
As with all other NRTIs, Kivexa may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Kivexa during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
Why has Kivexa been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Kivexa’ s benefits are greater than its risks in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of HIV infected adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.
The Committee noted that the demonstration of Kivexa’ s benefit was mainly based on one study in adults, most of whom had not received previous treatment for HIV infection and had no symptoms of HIV infection.
The Committee recommended that Kivexa be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Kivexa:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Kivexa to Glaxo Group Ltd on 17 December 2004.
