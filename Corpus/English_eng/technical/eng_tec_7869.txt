CLINICAL PARTICULARS
au 4.1 Therapeutic indications
er Dynepo is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult patients.
It may be used in patients on dialysis and in patients not on dialysis. ng 4.2 Posology and method of administration lo
Treatment with Dynepo should be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of anaemia no
associated with CRF..
The dosage of Dynepo must be adjusted individually to maintain the level of haemoglobin within the ct
target range of 10 to 12g/ dl. du
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician’ s evaluation of the individual patient ’ s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Dynepo ro
should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ L).
Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving lp
haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. a
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and in
below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dL ic
(6.2 mmol/ l) to 12g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dL ed
(7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l) are observed, are described below (see Dose Management M
section below).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dL (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Dynepo is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
2 Dose Management
Starting dose is 50 IU/ kg three times a week if administered intravenously.
50 IU/ kg twice a week if administered subcutaneously.
It may not be necessary to use erythropoietin during the first three months after starting peritoneal dialysis because an increase in haemoglobin often occurs during this period.
Sufficient time should be allowed to determine a patient ’ s responsiveness to a dosage of Dynepo before adjusting the dose.
Because of the time required for erythropoiesis, an interval of approximately 4 weeks may occur between the time of a dose adjustment (initiation, increase, decrease or discontinuation) and a significant change in haemoglobin.
In consequence, dose adjustment should not
ed be made more frequently than once a month, unless clinically indicated.
Dose should be decreased by 25% – 50% or treatment temporarily withdrawn and then re-introduced
is with a lower dosage if:
or
- Haemoglobin reaches ≥ 12 g/ dl or
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin > 2 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
th Dose should be increased by 25% – 50% if:
au
- Haemoglobin falls below < 10 g/ dl and
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin is below 0.7 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
er Administration ng Dynepo may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
Subcutaneous self administration may be used after training by a medical professional. lo
The required weekly dose of Dynepo is lower when Dynepo is administered subcutaneously compared no
to intravenously. ct
For subcutaneous injection, the whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between thumb and forefinger, the skin fold should be held throughout the injection. du
Discard the syringe after initial single use. ro
Special populations lp
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer. a in
No special dosage adjustments are required in elderly patients.
Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and renal failure should where possible be maintained at ic
a total haemoglobin concentration between 7 and 9 g/ dl. ed
The experience in children is limited.
Due to limited experience, the efficacy and safety of Dynepo could not be assessed in patients with M
impaired liver function.
4.3 Contra-indications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients Uncontrolled hypertension.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in Section 4.2.
3 In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Hypertension
Most of patients with chronic renal failure have a history of hypertension.
Patients on Dynepo therapy can experience increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
ed Therefore, in patients treated with Dynepo, special care should be taken to monitor closely and control blood pressure.
Blood pressure should be controlled adequately before initiation and during therapy to
is avoid acute complications like hypertensive encephalopathy and related complications (seizures, stroke).
If these reactions occur they require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive
or medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden sharp migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
th Increases in blood pressure may require treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines or dosing increase of
au existing anti-hypertensive medications.
In addition, a reduction of the administered dose of Dynepo needs to be considered.
If blood pressure values remain high, a transient interruption of Dynepo therapy may be required.
er Once hypertension is controlled with more intensified therapy, Dynepo therapy should be re-started at a reduced dose. ng Iron evaluation lo
During Dynepo therapy, absolute or functional iron deficiency may develop.
This is the most common no
cause of an incomplete response to an erythropoietin therapy.
Therefore, prior to and during Dynepo therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated.
Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and ct
ferritin should be at least 100 ng/ ml.
If transferrin saturation falls below 20%, or if ferritin falls below du
100 ng/ ml, iron should be administered.
Virtually all patients will eventually require supplemental iron to increase or maintain transferrin saturation and ferritin to levels that will adequately support erythropoiesis stimulated by Dynepo. ro
Anaemia in epoetin-resistant or hyporesponsive patients with failure to respond to 20,000 IU/ week lp
should be investigated, including referral to a haematologist. a
In the iron-replete patient with an inadequate response to Dynepo therapy, the following conditions should be evaluated and treated, if appropriated: in
• Infection/ inflammation ic
• Occult blood loss ed
• Hyperparathyroidism/ Osteitis fibrosa cystica • Aluminium intoxication M
• Haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia • Vitamin deficiencies, i. e., folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiencies • Haemolysis • Malignant diseases including multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome • Malnutrition
Laboratory monitoring
It is recommended that a complete blood count and platelet count is performed regularly.
The haemoglobin level should be determined once a week until it has stabilised in the suggested target range and the maintenance dose has been established.
After any dose adjustment, the haemoglobin
4 should also be determined once weekly until it has stabilised in the target range.
The haemoglobin level should then be monitored at regular intervals.
Serum chemistry values including creatinine and potassium should be monitored regularly during Dynepo therapy.
Other
Although it has not been observed with Dynepo, since anaphylactoid reactions may occur with erythropoietin, it is recommended that the first dose be administered under medical supervision.
The use of Dynepo in nephrosclerotic patients not yet undergoing dialysis should be defined
ed individually, as a possible acceleration of progression of renal failure cannot be ruled out with certainty.
is During haemodialysis, patients treated with Dynepo may require increased anticoagulation treatment
or to prevent clotting of the arterio-venous shunt.
th Misuse of epoetin by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in haemoglobin and haematocrit.
This may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications
au 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed. er ng No interactions have been reported during treatment with Dynepo in the course of clinical trials. lo
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation no
Pregnancy:
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant ct
women.
In case of its use during pregnancy, concomitant iron substitution should be considered in the mother. du
Lactation:
It is not known whether Dynepo is excreted in human breast milk.
Since many compounds are excreted in human milk, caution should be advised when Dynepo is administered to breast-feeding ro
women. lp
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines a
Dynepo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. in ic
4.8 Undesirable effects ed
Approximately 10% of patients can be expected to experience an adverse drug reaction.
The most common are hypertension, access related thrombosis and headache.
Clinical experience with epoetins M
suggest hypertension and thrombosis risk may be reduced by titrating the dose to maintain haemoglobin levels between 10 to 12 g/ dl.

4.9 Overdose
The maximum dose of epoetin delta that can be safely administered in single or multiple doses has not ct
been determined. du
Treatment can result in polycythaemia if the haemoglobin/ haematocrit is not carefully monitored and the dose appropriately adjusted.
If the suggested target range is exceeded, treatment with epoetin delta ro
should be temporarily withdrawn until the haemoglobin/ haematocrit returns to the suggested target range.
Epoetin delta can then be reintroduced with a lower dosage (see section 4.2). lp
If severe polycythaemia occurs, conventional methods (phlebotomy) may be indicated to decrease the a
haemoglobin level. in ic

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ed
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties M
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antianaemic - ATC code:
B03XA.
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
It acts as a mitosis stimulating factor and differentiation hormone.
The biological efficacy of erythropoietin has been demonstrated after intravenous and subcutaneous administration in various animal models in vivo (rats and dogs).
After administration of epoetin delta, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe- incorporation rate.
During the clinical trials, there were no indications of development of neutralising antibodies to 6 epoetin delta in humans based on the clinical response.
When administration is halted, the eyrthropoietic parameters return toward baseline levels within the recovery period of 1-3 months.
Subcutaneous administration results in a similar pattern of erythropoietic stimulation as after intravenous administration.
Patients with cancer
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
ed Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies of epoetin alfa, beta and darbepoetin alfa involving a total of 2,833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-
is controlled studies and one was an open-label study.
Two of the studies recruited patients who were
or being treated with chemotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dL; in the remaining three studies it was 12-14 g/ dL.
In the open-label study there was no difference in
th overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in
au favour of controls.
These studies have shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received
er recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications ng between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group. lo A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of no
1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is therefore consistent evidence to ct
suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who are treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of du
recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dL, is unclear because few patients with these ro
characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
Survival outcomes and tumour progression in cancer patients that are being treated with Dynepo for anaemia associated with chronic renal failure lp
have not been investigated.
The extent to which the outcomes observed in the clinical studies discussed above may apply to this patient population is unclear, specifically considering that the a
dosages administered in the renal indication are lower than in the cancer indication. in
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ic ed
The pharmacokinetics of erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta has been examined in both healthy volunteers and patients with chronic renal failure.
Following intravenous doses, M
volume of distribution approximates total blood volume and ranges from 0.063 to 0.097 l/ kg.
The elimination half-life ranges from 4.7 to 13.2 hours in patients.
Half life is approximately 50% shorter in healthy subjects.
Measurable concentrations of erythropoietin are maintained in the serum for at least 24 hours following doses ranging from 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
Exposure to erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta increases proportionately in patients given intravenous doses of 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
No accumulation of epoetin delta was observed after repeated intravenous administration three times weekly.
Peak serum concentrations for subcutaneously administered epoetin delta occur between 8 and 36 hours following injection.
The half-life of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is prolonged compared to intravenous administration and ranges from 27 to 33 hours in patients.
The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is between 26% and 36%.
7 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal studies conducted with both Dynepo and epoetin alfa in pregnant female rats and rabbits did not show any teratogenic effect, but indicated class-related reversible effects on growth and haematopoiesis in the offspring.
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

Therapeutic indications
ng
Dynepo is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult patients.
It may be used in patients on dialysis and in patients not on dialysis. lo no
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Dynepo should be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of anaemia ct
associated with CRF. du
The dosage of Dynepo must be adjusted individually to maintain the level of haemoglobin within the target range of 10 to 12g/ dl. ro
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a lp
physician’ s evaluation of the individual patient ’ s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Dynepo should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not a
greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ L).
Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving in
haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. ic
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and ed
below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dL M
(6.2 mmol/ l) to 12g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l) are observed, are described below (see Dose Management section below).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dL (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Dynepo is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
10 Dose Management
Starting dose is 50 IU/ kg three times a week if administered intravenously.
50 IU/ kg twice a week if administered subcutaneously.
It may not be necessary to use erythropoietin during the first three months after starting peritoneal dialysis because an increase in haemoglobin often occurs during this period.
Sufficient time should be allowed to determine a patient ’ s responsiveness to a dosage of Dynepo before adjusting the dose.
Because of the time required for erythropoiesis, an interval of approximately 4 weeks may occur between the time of a dose adjustment (initiation, increase, decrease or discontinuation) and a significant change in haemoglobin.
In consequence, dose adjustment should not
ed be made more frequently than once a month, unless clinically indicated.
Dose should be decreased by 25% – 50% or treatment temporarily withdrawn and then re-introduced
is with a lower dosage if:
or
- Haemoglobin reaches ≥ 12 g/ dl or
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin > 2 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
th Dose should be increased by 25% – 50% if:
au
- Haemoglobin falls below < 10 g/ dl and
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin is below 0.7 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
Administration er ng Dynepo may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
Subcutaneous self administration may lo be used after training by a medical professional. no
The required weekly dose of Dynepo is lower when Dynepo is administered subcutaneously compared to intravenously. ct
For subcutaneous injection, the whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between thumb and forefinger, the skin fold should be held throughout the injection. du
Discard the syringe after initial single use. ro
Special populations lp
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer. a in
No special dosage adjustments are required in elderly patients.
Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and renal failure should where possible be maintained at ic
a total haemoglobin concentration between 7 and 9 g/ dl. ed
The experience in children is limited.
Due to limited experience, the safety and efficacy of Dynepo could not be assessed in patients with M
impaired liver function.
4.3 Contra-indications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Uncontrolled hypertension.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in Section 4.2.
11 In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Hypertension
Most of patients with chronic renal failure have a history of hypertension.
Patients on Dynepo therapy can experience increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
ed Therefore, in patients treated with Dynepo, special care should be taken to monitor closely and control blood pressure.
Blood pressure should be controlled adequately before initiation and during therapy to
is avoid acute complications like hypertensive encephalopathy and related complications (seizures, stroke).
If these reactions occur they require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive
or medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden sharp migraine-like headaches as a possible
th warning signal.
Increases in blood pressure may require treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines or dosing increase of
au existing anti-hypertensive medications.
In addition, a reduction of the administered dose of Dynepo needs to be considered.
If blood pressure values remain high, a transient interruption of Dynepo therapy may be required.
er Once hypertension is controlled with more intensified therapy, Dynepo therapy should be re-started at a reduced dose. ng Iron evaluation lo
During Dynepo therapy, absolute or functional iron deficiency may develop.
This is the most common no
cause of an incomplete response to an erythropoietin therapy.
Therefore, prior to and during Dynepo therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated.
Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and ct
ferritin should be at least 100 ng/ ml.
If transferrin saturation falls below 20%, or if ferritin falls below du
100 ng/ ml, iron should be administered.
Virtually all patients will eventually require supplemental iron to increase or maintain transferrin saturation and ferritin to levels that will adequately support ro
erythropoiesis stimulated by Dynepo.
Anaemia in epoetin-resistant or hyporesponsive patients with failure to respond to 20,000 IU/ week lp
should be investigated, including referral to a haematologist. a
In the iron-replete patient with an inadequate response to Dynepo therapy, the following conditions in
should be evaluated and treated, if appropriated: • Infection/ inflammation ic
• Occult blood loss ed
• Hyperparathyroidism/ Osteitis fibrosa cystica • Aluminium intoxication M
• Haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia • Vitamin deficiencies, i. e., folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiencies • Haemolysis • Malignant diseases including multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome • Malnutrition
Laboratory monitoring
It is recommended that a complete blood count and platelet count is performed regularly.
The haemoglobin level should be determined once a week until it has stabilised in the suggested target range and the maintenance dose has been established.
After any dose adjustment, the haemoglobin
12 should also be determined once weekly until it has stabilised in the target range.
The haemoglobin level should then be monitored at regular intervals.
Serum chemistry values including creatinine and potassium should be monitored regularly during Dynepo therapy.
Other
Although it has not been observed with Dynepo, since anaphylactoid reactions may occur with erythropoietin, it is recommended that the first dose be administered under medical supervision.
The use of Dynepo in nephrosclerotic patients not yet undergoing dialysis should be defined
ed individually, as a possible acceleration of progression of renal failure cannot be ruled out with certainty.
is During haemodialysis, patients treated with Dynepo may require increased anticoagulation treatment
or to prevent clotting of the arterio-venous shunt.
th Misuse of epoetin by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in haemoglobin and haematocrit.
This may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
au 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed. er ng No interactions have been reported during treatment with Dynepo in the course of clinical trials. lo
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation no
Pregnancy:
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant ct
women.

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties M
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antianaemic - ATC code:
B03XA.
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
It acts as a mitosis stimulating factor and differentiation hormone.
The biological efficacy of erythropoietin has been demonstrated after intravenous and subcutaneous administration in various animal models in vivo (rats and dogs).
After administration of epoetin delta, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe- incorporation rate.
14 During the clinical trials, there were no indications of development of neutralising antibodies to epoetin delta in humans based on the clinical response.
When administration is halted, the eyrthropoietic parameters return toward baseline levels within the recovery period of 1-3 months.
Subcutaneous administration results in a similar pattern of erythropoietic stimulation as after intravenous administration.
Patients with cancer
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors
ed may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies of epoetin alfa,
is beta and darbepoetin alfa involving a total of 2,833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-
or controlled studies and one was an open-label study.
Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dL;
th in the remaining three studies it was 12-14 g/ dL.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the
au four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess
er mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could ng not be satisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group. lo
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating no
in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in ct
patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is therefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who are treated with recombinant du
human erythropoietin.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve ro
haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dL, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
Survival outcomes and tumour progression in lp
cancer patients that are being treated with Dynepo for anaemia associated with chronic renal failure have not been investigated.
The extent to which the outcomes observed in the clinical studies a
discussed above may apply to this patient population is unclear, specifically considering that the in
dosages administered in the renal indication are lower than in the cancer indication. ic
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ed
The pharmacokinetics of erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta has been examined M
in both healthy volunteers and patients with chronic renal failure.
Following intravenous doses, volume of distribution approximates total blood volume and ranges from 0.063 to 0.097 l/ kg.
The elimination half-life ranges from 4.7 to 13.2 hours in patients.
Half life is approximately 50% shorter in healthy subjects.
Measurable concentrations of erythropoietin are maintained in the serum for at least 24 hours following doses ranging from 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
Exposure to erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta increases proportionately in patients given intravenous doses of 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
No accumulation of epoetin delta was observed after repeated intravenous administration three times weekly.
Peak serum concentrations for subcutaneously administered epoetin delta occur between 8 and 36 hours following injection.
The half-life of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is prolonged compared to intravenous administration and ranges from 27 to 33 hours in patients.
The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is between 26% and 36%.
15 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal studies conducted with both Dynepo and epoetin alfa in pregnant female rats and rabbits did not show any teratogenic effect, but indicated class-related reversible effects on growth and haematopoiesis in the offspring.
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
er 4.1
Therapeutic indications
ng
Dynepo is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult patients.
It may be used in patients on dialysis and in patients not on dialysis. lo
4.2 Posology and method of administration no
Treatment with Dynepo should be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of anaemia associated with CRF. ct
The dosage of Dynepo must be adjusted individually to maintain the level of haemoglobin within the du
target range of 10 to 12g/ dl. ro
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician’ s evaluation of the individual patient ’ s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Dynepo lp
should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ L).
Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving a
haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. in
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and ic
below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed ed
through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dL (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dL M
(7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l) are observed, are described below (see Dose Management section below).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dL (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Dynepo is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
18 Dose Management
Starting dose is 50 IU/ kg three times a week if administered intravenously.
50 IU/ kg twice a week if administered subcutaneously.
It may not be necessary to use erythropoietin during the first three months after starting peritoneal dialysis because an increase in haemoglobin often occurs during this period.
Sufficient time should be allowed to determine a patient ’ s responsiveness to a dosage of Dynepo before adjusting the dose.
Because of the time required for erythropoiesis, an interval of approximately 4 weeks may occur between the time of a dose adjustment (initiation, increase, decrease or discontinuation) and a significant change in haemoglobin.
In consequence, dose adjustment should not
ed be made more frequently than once a month, unless clinically indicated.
Dose should be decreased by 25% – 50% or treatment temporarily withdrawn and then re-introduced
is with a lower dosage if:
or
- Haemoglobin reaches ≥ 12 g/ dl or
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin > 2 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
th Dose should be increased by 25% – 50% if:
au
- Haemoglobin falls below < 10 g/ dl and
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin is below 0.7 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
Administration er ng Dynepo may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
Subcutaneous self administration may lo be used after training by a medical professional. no
The required weekly dose of Dynepo is lower when Dynepo is administered subcutaneously compared to intravenously. ct
For subcutaneous injection, the whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between thumb and forefinger, the skin fold should be held throughout the injection. du
Discard the syringe after initial single use. ro
Special populations lp
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer. a in
No special dosage adjustments are required in elderly patients.
Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and renal failure should where possible be maintained at ic
a total haemoglobin concentration between 7 and 9 g/ dl. ed
The experience in children is limited.
Due to limited experience, the safety and efficacy of Dynepo could not be assessed in patients with M
impaired liver function.
4.3 Contra-indications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Uncontrolled hypertension.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in Section 4.2.
19 In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Hypertension
Most of patients with chronic renal failure have a history of hypertension.
Patients on Dynepo therapy can experience increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
ed Therefore, in patients treated with Dynepo, special care should be taken to monitor closely and control blood pressure.
Blood pressure should be controlled adequately before initiation and during therapy to
is avoid acute complications like hypertensive encephalopathy and related complications (seizures, stroke).
If these reactions occur they require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive
or medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden sharp migraine-like headaches as a possible
th warning signal.
Increases in blood pressure may require treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines or dosing increase of
au existing anti-hypertensive medications.
In addition, a reduction of the administered dose of Dynepo needs to be considered.
If blood pressure values remain high, a transient interruption of Dynepo therapy may be required.
er Once hypertension is controlled with more intensified therapy, Dynepo therapy should be re-started at a reduced dose. ng Iron evaluation lo
During Dynepo therapy, absolute or functional iron deficiency may develop.
This is the most common no
cause of an incomplete response to an erythropoietin therapy.
Therefore, prior to and during Dynepo therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated.
Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and ct
ferritin should be at least 100 ng/ ml.
If transferrin saturation falls below 20%, or if ferritin falls below du
100 ng/ ml, iron should be administered.
Virtually all patients will eventually require supplemental iron to increase or maintain transferrin saturation and ferritin to levels that will adequately support ro
erythropoiesis stimulated by Dynepo.
Anaemia in epoetin-resistant or hyporesponsive patients with failure to respond to 20,000 IU/ week lp
should be investigated, including referral to a haematologist. a
In the iron-replete patient with an inadequate response to Dynepo therapy, the following conditions in
should be evaluated and treated, if appropriated: • Infection/ inflammation ic
• Occult blood loss ed
• Hyperparathyroidism/ Osteitis fibrosa cystica • Aluminium intoxication M
• Haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia • Vitamin deficiencies, i. e., folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiencies • Haemolysis • Malignant diseases including multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome • Malnutrition
Laboratory monitoring
It is recommended that a complete blood count and platelet count is performed regularly.
20 The haemoglobin level should be determined once a week until it has stabilised in the suggested target range and the maintenance dose has been established.
After any dose adjustment, the haemoglobin should also be determined once weekly until it has stabilised in the target range.
The haemoglobin level should then be monitored at regular intervals.
Serum chemistry values including creatinine and potassium should be monitored regularly during Dynepo therapy.
Other
Although it has not been observed with Dynepo, since anaphylactoid reactions may occur with erythropoietin, it is recommended that the first dose be administered under medical supervision.
ed The use of Dynepo in nephrosclerotic patients not yet undergoing dialysis should be defined individually, as a possible acceleration of progression of renal failure cannot be ruled out with
is certainty.
or During haemodialysis, patients treated with Dynepo may require increased anticoagulation treatment
th to prevent clotting of the arterio-venous shunt.
au Misuse of epoetin by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in haemoglobin and haematocrit.
This may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
4.5 er Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ng No interaction studies have been performed. lo
No interactions have been reported during treatment with Dynepo in the course of clinical trials. no
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation ct
Pregnancy:
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant du
women.
In case of its use during pregnancy, concomitant iron substitution should be considered in the mother. ro
Lactation:
It is not known whether Dynepo is excreted in human breast milk.
Since many compounds are excreted in human milk, caution should be advised when Dynepo is administered to breast-feeding lp
women. a
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines in ic
Dynepo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. ed
4.8 Undesirable effects M
Approximately 10% of patients can be expected to experience an adverse drug reaction.
The most common are hypertension, access related thrombosis and headache.
Clinical experience with epoetins suggest hypertension and thrombosis risk may be reduced by titrating the dose to maintain haemoglobin levels between 10 to 12 g/ dl.
The frequency of adverse events that were experienced during Dynepo therapy is tabulated below.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:

4.9 Overdose no
The maximum dose of epoetin delta that can be safely administered in single or multiple doses has not been determined. ct
Treatment can result in polycythaemia if the haemoglobin/ haematocrit is not carefully monitored and du
the dose appropriately adjusted.
If the suggested target range is exceeded, treatment with epoetin delta should be temporarily withdrawn until the haemoglobin/ haematocrit returns to the suggested target ro
range.
Epoetin delta can then be reintroduced with a lower dosage (see section 4.2). lp
If severe polycythaemia occurs, conventional methods (phlebotomy) may be indicated to decrease the haemoglobin level. a in ic

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ed
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties M
Pharmacotherapeutic group:

Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
It acts as a mitosis stimulating factor and differentiation hormone.
The biological efficacy of erythropoietin has been demonstrated after intravenous and subcutaneous administration in various animal models in vivo (rats and dogs).
After administration of epoetin delta, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe- incorporation rate.
22 During the clinical trials, there were no indications of development of neutralising antibodies to epoetin delta in humans based on the clinical response.
When administration is halted, the eyrthropoietic parameters return toward baseline levels within the recovery period of 1-3 months.
Subcutaneous administration results in a similar pattern of erythropoietic stimulation as after intravenous administration.
Patients with cancer
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors
ed may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies of epoetin alfa,
is beta and darbepoetin alfa involving a total of 2,833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-
or controlled studies and one was an open-label study.
Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dL;
th in the remaining three studies it was 12-14 g/ dL.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the
au four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess
er mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could ng not be satisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group. lo
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating no
in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in ct
patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is therefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who are treated with recombinant du
human erythropoietin.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve ro
haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dL, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
Survival outcomes and tumour progression in lp
cancer patients that are being treated with Dynepo for anaemia associated with chronic renal failure have not been investigated.
The extent to which the outcomes observed in the clinical studies a
discussed above may apply to this patient population is unclear, specifically considering that the in
dosages administered in the renal indication are lower than in the cancer indication. ic
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ed
The pharmacokinetics of erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta has been examined M
in both healthy volunteers and patients with chronic renal failure.
Following intravenous doses, volume of distribution approximates total blood volume and ranges from 0.063 to 0.097 l/ kg.
The elimination half-life ranges from 4.7 to 13.2 hours in patients.
Half life is approximately 50% shorter in healthy subjects.
Measurable concentrations of erythropoietin are maintained in the serum for at least 24 hours following doses ranging from 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
Exposure to erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta increases proportionately in patients given intravenous doses of 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
No accumulation of epoetin delta was observed after repeated intravenous administration three times weekly.
Peak serum concentrations for subcutaneously administered epoetin delta occur between 8 and 36 hours following injection.
The half-life of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is prolonged compared to intravenous administration and ranges from 27 to 33 hours in patients.
23 The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is between 26% and 36%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal studies conducted with both Dynepo and epoetin alfa in pregnant female rats and rabbits did not show any teratogenic effect, but indicated class-related reversible effects on growth and haematopoiesis in the offspring.
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
au 4.1 Therapeutic indications
er Dynepo is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult patients.
It may be used in patients on dialysis and in patients not on dialysis. ng lo 4.2 Posology and method of administration no
Treatment with Dynepo should be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of anaemia associated with CRF. ct
The dosage of Dynepo must be adjusted individually to maintain the level of haemoglobin within the target range of 10 to 12g/ dl. du
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a ro
physician’ s evaluation of the individual patient ’ s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Dynepo should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not lp
greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ L).
Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. a in
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed ic
through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dL ed
(6.2 mmol/ l) to 12g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin M
values exceeding 12 g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l) are observed, are described below (see Dose Management section below).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dL (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Dynepo is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
26 Dose Management
Starting dose is 50 IU/ kg three times a week if administered intravenously.
50 IU/ kg twice a week if administered subcutaneously.
It may not be necessary to use erythropoietin during the first three months after starting peritoneal dialysis because an increase in haemoglobin often occurs during this period.
Sufficient time should be allowed to determine a patient ’ s responsiveness to a dosage of Dynepo before adjusting the dose.
Because of the time required for erythropoiesis, an interval of approximately 4 weeks may occur between the time of a dose adjustment (initiation, increase, decrease or discontinuation) and a significant change in haemoglobin.
In consequence, dose adjustment should not
ed be made more frequently than once a month, unless clinically indicated.
Dose should be decreased by 25% – 50% or treatment temporarily withdrawn and then re-introduced
is with a lower dosage if:
or
- Haemoglobin reaches ≥ 12 g/ dl or
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin > 2 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
th Dose should be increased by 25% – 50% if:
au
- Haemoglobin falls below < 10 g/ dl and
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin is below 0.7 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
Administration er ng Dynepo may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
Subcutaneous self administration may lo be used after training by a medical professional. no
The required weekly dose of Dynepo is lower when Dynepo is administered subcutaneously compared to intravenously. ct
For subcutaneous injection, the whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between thumb and forefinger, the skin fold should be held throughout the injection. du
Discard the syringe after initial single use. ro
Special populations lp
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer. a in
No special dosage adjustments are required in elderly patients.
Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and renal failure should where possible be maintained at ic
a total haemoglobin concentration between 7 and 9 g/ dl. ed
The experience in children is limited Due to limited experience, the safety and efficacy of Dynepo could not be assessed in patients with M

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in Section 4.2.
27 In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Hypertension
Most of patients with chronic renal failure have a history of hypertension.
Patients on Dynepo therapy can experience increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
ed Therefore, in patients treated with Dynepo, special care should be taken to monitor closely and control blood pressure.
Blood pressure should be controlled adequately before initiation and during therapy to avoid acute complications like hypertensive encephalopathy and related complications (seizures,
is stroke).
If these reactions occur they require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive
or medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden sharp migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
th Increases in blood pressure may require treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines or dosing increase of existing anti-hypertensive medications.
In addition, a reduction of the administered dose of Dynepo
au needs to be considered.
If blood pressure values remain high, a transient interruption of Dynepo therapy may be required.
er Once hypertension is controlled with more intensified therapy, Dynepo therapy should be re-started at a reduced dose. ng Iron evaluation lo
During Dynepo therapy, absolute or functional iron deficiency may develop.
This is the most common no
cause of an incomplete response to an erythropoietin therapy.
Therefore, prior to and during Dynepo therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated.
Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and ct
ferritin should be at least 100 ng/ ml.
If transferrin saturation falls below 20%, or if ferritin falls below 100 ng/ ml, iron should be administered.
Virtually all patients will eventually require supplemental iron du
to increase or maintain transferrin saturation and ferritin to levels that will adequately support erythropoiesis stimulated by Dynepo. ro
Anaemia in epoetin-resistant or hyporesponsive patients with failure to respond to 20,000 IU/ week should be investigated, including referral to a haematologist. lp
In the iron-replete patient with an inadequate response to Dynepo therapy, the following conditions a
should be evaluated and treated, if appropriated: in
• Infection/ inflammation ic
• Occult blood loss • Hyperparathyroidism/ Osteitis fibrosa cystica ed
• Aluminium intoxication • Haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia M
• Vitamin deficiencies, i. e., folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiencies • Haemolysis • Malignant diseases including multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome • Malnutrition
Laboratory monitoring
It is recommended that a complete blood count and platelet count is performed regularly.
28 The haemoglobin level should be determined once a week until it has stabilised in the suggested target range and the maintenance dose has been established.
After any dose adjustment, the haemoglobin should also be determined once weekly until it has stabilised in the target range.
The haemoglobin level should then be monitored at regular intervals.
Serum chemistry values including creatinine and potassium should be monitored regularly during Dynepo therapy.
Other:
Although it has not been observed with Dynepo, since anaphylactoid reactions may occur with erythropoietin, it is recommended that the first dose be administered under medical supervision.
ed The use of Dynepo in nephrosclerotic patients not yet undergoing dialysis should be defined individually, as a possible acceleration of progression of renal failure cannot be ruled out with certainty.
is or During haemodialysis, patients treated with Dynepo may require increased anticoagulation treatment to prevent clotting of the arterio-venous shunt.
th Misuse of epoetin by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in haemoglobin and haematocrit.
au This may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
er 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ng No interaction studies have been performed. lo No interactions have been reported during treatment with Dynepo in the course of clinical trials. no
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy:
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy (see section 5.3).
The ct
potential risk for humans is unknown.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.
In case of its use during pregnancy, concomitant iron substitution should be considered in the du
mother.
Lactation:
It is not known whether Dynepo is excreted in human breast milk.
Since many compounds ro
are excreted in human milk, caution should be advised when Dynepo is administered to breast-feeding women. lp
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines a in
Dynepo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. ic
4.8 Undesirable effects ed
Approximately 10% of patients can be expected to experience an adverse drug reaction.
The most M
common are hypertension, access related thrombosis and headache.
Clinical experience with epoetins suggest hypertension and thrombosis risk may be reduced by titrating the dose to maintain haemoglobin levels between 10 to 12 g/ dl.
The frequency of adverse events that were experienced during Dynepo therapy is tabulated below.

4.9 Overdose no
The maximum dose of epoetin delta that can be safely administered in single or multiple doses has not been determined. ct
Treatment can result in polycythaemia if the haemoglobin/ haematocrit is not carefully monitored and du
the dose appropriately adjusted.
If the suggested target range is exceeded, treatment with epoetin delta should be temporarily withdrawn until the haemoglobin/ haematocrit returns to the suggested target ro
range.
Epoetin delta can then be reintroduced with a lower dosage (see section 4.2). lp
If severe polycythaemia occurs, conventional methods (phlebotomy) may be indicated to decrease the haemoglobin level. a in ic

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ed
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties M
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antianaemic - ATC code:
B03XA..
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
It acts as a mitosis stimulating factor and differentiation hormone.
The biological efficacy of erythropoietin has been demonstrated after intravenous and subcutaneous administration in various animal models in vivo (rats and dogs).
After administration of epoetin delta, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe- incorporation rate.
30 During the clinical trials, there were no indications of development of neutralising antibodies to epoetin delta in humans based on the clinical response.
When administration is halted, the eyrthropoietic parameters return toward baseline levels within the recovery period of 1-3 months.
Subcutaneous administration results in a similar pattern of erythropoietic stimulation as after intravenous administration.
Patients with cancer
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors
ed may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies of epoetin alfa,
is beta and darbepoetin alfa involving a total of 2,833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-
or controlled studies and one was an open-label study.
Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dL;
th in the remaining three studies it was 12-14 g/ dL.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the
au four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess
er mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could ng not be satisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group. lo
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating no
in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in ct
patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is therefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who are treated with recombinant du
human erythropoietin.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve ro
haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dL, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
Survival outcomes and tumour progression in lp
cancer patients that are being treated with Dynepo for anaemia associated with chronic renal failure have not been investigated.
The extent to which the outcomes observed in the clinical studies a
discussed above may apply to this patient population is unclear, specifically considering that the in
dosages administered in the renal indication are lower than in the cancer indication. ic
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ed
The pharmacokinetics of erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta has been examined M
in both healthy volunteers and patients with chronic renal failure.
Following intravenous doses, volume of distribution approximates total blood volume and ranges from 0.063 to 0.097 l/ kg.
The elimination half-life ranges from 4.7 to 13.2 hours in patients.
Half life is approximately 50% shorter in healthy subjects.
Measurable concentrations of erythropoietin are maintained in the serum for at least 24 hours following doses ranging from 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
Exposure to erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta increases proportionately in patients given intravenous doses of 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
No accumulation of epoetin delta was observed after repeated intravenous administration three times weekly.
Peak serum concentrations for subcutaneously administered epoetin delta occur between 8 and 36 hours following injection.
The half-life of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is prolonged compared to intravenous administration and ranges from 27 to 33 hours in patients.
The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is between 26% and 36%.
31 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal studies conducted with both Dynepo and epoetin alfa in pregnant female rats and rabbits did not show any teratogenic effect, but indicated class-related reversible effects on growth and haematopoiesis in the offspring.
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
er 4.1
Therapeutic indications
ng
Dynepo is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure(CRF) in adult patients.
It may be used in patients on dialysis and in patients not on dialysis. lo no
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Dynepo should be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of anaemia ct
associated with CRF. du
The dosage of Dynepo must be adjusted individually to maintain the level of haemoglobin within the target range of 10 to 12g/ dl. ro
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a lp
physician’ s evaluation of the individual patient ’ s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Dynepo should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not a
greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ L).
Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving in
haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. ic
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and ed
below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dL M
(6.2 mmol/ l) to 12g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l) are observed, are described below (see Dose Management section below).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dL (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Dynepo is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
34 Dose Management
Starting dose is 50 IU/ kg three times a week if administered intravenously.
50 IU/ kg twice a week if administered subcutaneously.
It may not be necessary to use erythropoietin during the first three months after starting peritoneal dialysis because an increase in haemoglobin often occurs during this period.
Sufficient time should be allowed to determine a patient ’ s responsiveness to a dosage of Dynepo before adjusting the dose.
Because of the time required for erythropoiesis, an interval of approximately 4 weeks may occur between the time of a dose adjustment (initiation, increase, decrease or discontinuation) and a significant change in haemoglobin.
In consequence, dose adjustment should not be made more frequently than once a month, unless clinically indicated.
ed Dose should be decreased by 25% – 50% or treatment temporarily withdrawn and then re-introduced
is with a lower dosage if:
or
- Haemoglobin reaches ≥ 12 g/ dl or
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin > 2 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
th Dose should be increased by 25% – 50% if:
au
- Haemoglobin falls below < 10 g/ dl and
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin is below 0.7 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
Administration er ng Dynepo may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
Subcutaneous self administration may lo be used after training by a medical professional.
The required weekly dose of Dynepo is lower when Dynepo is administered subcutaneously compared no
to intravenously. ct
For subcutaneous injection, the whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between thumb and forefinger, the skin fold should be held throughout the injection. du
Discard the syringe after initial single use. ro
Special populations lp
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer. a in
No special dosage adjustments are required in elderly patients.
Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and renal failure should where possible be maintained at ic
a total haemoglobin concentration between 7 and 9 g/ dl. ed
The experience in children is limited.
Due to limited experience, the safety and efficacy of Dynepo could not be assessed in patients with impaired liver function.
M
4.3 Contra-indications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Uncontrolled hypertension.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in Section 4.2.
35 In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Hypertension
Most of patients with chronic renal failure have a history of hypertension.
Patients on Dynepo therapy can experience increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
ed Therefore, in patients treated with Dynepo, special care should be taken to monitor closely and control blood pressure.
Blood pressure should be controlled adequately before initiation and during therapy to avoid acute complications like hypertensive encephalopathy and related complications (seizures,
is stroke).
If these reactions occur they require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive
or medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden sharp migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
th Increases in blood pressure may require treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines or dosing increase of
au existing anti-hypertensive medications.
In addition, a reduction of the administered dose of Dynepo needs to be considered.
If blood pressure values remain high, a transient interruption of Dynepo therapy may be required.
er Once hypertension is controlled with more intensified therapy, Dynepo therapy should be re-started at a reduced dose. ng Iron evaluation lo
During Dynepo therapy, absolute or functional iron deficiency may develop.
This is the most common no
cause of an incomplete response to an erythropoietin therapy.
Therefore, prior to and during Dynepo therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated.
Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and ct
ferritin should be at least 100 ng/ ml.
If transferrin saturation falls below 20%, or if ferritin falls below 100 ng/ ml, iron should be administered.
Virtually all patients will eventually require supplemental iron du
to increase or maintain transferrin saturation and ferritin to levels that will adequately support erythropoiesis stimulated by Dynepo. ro
Anaemia in epoetin-resistant or hyporesponsive patients with failure to respond to 20,000 IU/ week should be investigated, including referral to a haematologist. lp
In the iron-replete patient with an inadequate response to Dynepo therapy, the following conditions a
should be evaluated and treated, if appropriated: in
• Infection/ inflammation ic
• Occult blood loss Hyperparathyroidism/ Osteitis fibrosa cystica ed
• • Aluminium intoxication • Haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia M
• Vitamin deficiencies, i. e., folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiencies • Haemolysis • Malignant diseases including multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome • Malnutrition
Laboratory monitoring
It is recommended that a complete blood count and platelet count is performed regularly.
The haemoglobin level should be determined once a week until it has stabilised in the suggested target range and the maintenance dose has been established.
After any dose adjustment, the haemoglobin
36 should also be determined once weekly until it has stabilised in the target range.
The haemoglobin level should then be monitored at regular intervals.
Serum chemistry values including creatinine and potassium should be monitored regularly during Dynepo therapy.
Other
Although it has not been observed with Dynepo, since anaphylactoid reactions may occur with erythropoietin, it is recommended that the first dose be administered under medical supervision.
The use of Dynepo in nephrosclerotic patients not yet undergoing dialysis should be defined
ed individually, as a possible acceleration of progression of renal failure cannot be ruled out with certainty.
is During haemodialysis, patients treated with Dynepo may require increased anticoagulation treatment
or to prevent clotting of the arterio-venous shunt.
th Misuse of epoetin by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in haemoglobin and haematocrit.
This may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
au 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed. er ng No interactions have been reported during treatment with Dynepo in the course of clinical trials. lo
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation no
Pregnancy:
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant ct
women.
In case of its use during pregnancy, concomitant iron substitution should be considered in the mother. du
Lactation:
It is not known whether Dynepo is excreted in human breast milk.
Since many compounds are excreted in human milk, caution should be advised when Dynepo is administered to breast-feeding ro
women. lp
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines a
Dynepo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. in ic
4.8 Undesirable effects ed
Approximately 10% of patients can be expected to experience an adverse drug reaction.
The most common are hypertension, access related thrombosis and headache.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
er Dynepo is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) ng in adult patients.
It may be used in patients on dialysis and in patients not on dialysis. lo
4.2 Posology and method of administration no
Treatment with Dynepo should be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of anaemia associated with CRF. ct
The dosage of Dynepo must be adjusted individually to maintain the level of haemoglobin within the du
target range of 10 to 12g/ dl. ro
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician’ s evaluation of the individual patient’ s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Dynepo lp
should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ L).
Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving a
haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. in
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and ic
below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed ed
through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dL (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dL M
(7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l) are observed, are described below (see Dose Management section below).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dL (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Dynepo is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
42 Dose Management
Starting dose is 50 IU/ kg three times a week if administered intravenously.
50 IU/ kg twice a week if administered subcutaneously.
It may not be necessary to use erythropoietin during the first three months after starting peritoneal dialysis because an increase in haemoglobin often occurs during this period.
Sufficient time should be allowed to determine a patient’ s responsiveness to a dosage of Dynepo before adjusting the dose.
Because of the time required for erythropoiesis, an interval of approximately 4 weeks may occur between the time of a dose adjustment (initiation, increase, decrease or discontinuation) and a significant change in haemoglobin.
In consequence, dose adjustment should not be made more frequently than once a month, unless clinically indicated.
ed Dose should be decreased by 25% – 50% or treatment temporarily withdrawn and then re-introduced
is with a lower dosage if:
or
- Haemoglobin reaches ≥ 12 g/ dl or
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin > 2 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
th Dose should be increased by 25% – 50% if:
au
- Haemoglobin falls below < 10 g/ dl and
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin is below 0.7 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
Administration er ng Dynepo may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
Subcutaneous self administration may lo be used after training by a medical professional.
The required weekly dose of Dynepo is lower when Dynepo is administered subcutaneously compared no
to intravenously. ct
For subcutaneous injection, the whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between thumb and forefinger, the skin fold should be held throughout the injection. du
Discard the syringe after initial single use. ro
Special populations lp
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer. a in
No special dosage adjustments are required in elderly patients.
Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and renal failure should where possible be maintained at ic
a total haemoglobin concentration between 7 and 9 g/ dl. ed
The experience in children is limited.
Due to limited experience, the efficacy and safety of Dynepo could not be assessed in patients with impaired liver function.
M
4.3 Contra-indications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Uncontrolled hypertension.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in Section 4.2.
43 In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Hypertension
Most of patients with chronic renal failure have a history of hypertension.
Patients on Dynepo therapy can experience increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
ed Therefore, in patients treated with Dynepo, special care should be taken to monitor closely and control blood pressure.
Blood pressure should be controlled adequately before initiation and during therapy to avoid acute complications like hypertensive encephalopathy and related complications (seizures,
is stroke).
If these reactions occur they require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive
or medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden sharp migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
th Increases in blood pressure may require treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines or dosing increase of
au existing anti-hypertensive medications.
In addition, a reduction of the administered dose of Dynepo needs to be considered.
If blood pressure values remain high, a transient interruption of Dynepo therapy may be required.
er Once hypertension is controlled with more intensified therapy, Dynepo therapy should be re-started at a reduced dose. ng Iron evaluation lo
During Dynepo therapy, absolute or functional iron deficiency may develop.
This is the most common no
cause of an incomplete response to an erythropoietin therapy.
Therefore, prior to and during Dynepo therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated.
Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and ct
ferritin should be at least 100 ng/ ml.
If transferrin saturation falls below 20%, or if ferritin falls below 100 ng/ ml, iron should be administered.
Virtually all patients will eventually require supplemental iron du
to increase or maintain transferrin saturation and ferritin to levels that will adequately support erythropoiesis stimulated by Dynepo. ro
Anaemia in epoetin-resistant or hyporesponsive patients with failure to respond to 20,000 IU/ week should be investigated, including referral to a haematologist. lp
In the iron-replete patient with an inadequate response to Dynepo therapy, the following conditions a
should be evaluated and treated, if appropriated: in
• Infection/ inflammation ic
• Occult blood loss Hyperparathyroidism/ Osteitis fibrosa cystica ed
• • Aluminium intoxication Haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia M
• • Vitamin deficiencies, i. e., folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiencies • Haemolysis • Malignant diseases including multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome • Malnutrition
Laboratory monitoring
It is recommended that a complete blood count and platelet count is performed regularly.
The haemoglobin level should be determined once a week until it has stabilised in the suggested target range and the maintenance dose has been established.
After any dose adjustment, the haemoglobin
44 should also be determined once weekly until it has stabilised in the target range.
The haemoglobin level should then be monitored at regular intervals.
Serum chemistry values including creatinine and potassium should be monitored regularly during Dynepo therapy.
Other
Although it has not been observed with Dynepo, since anaphylactoid reactions may occur with erythropoietin, it is recommended that the first dose be administered under medical supervision.
The use of Dynepo in nephrosclerotic patients not yet undergoing dialysis should be defined individually,
ed as a possible acceleration of progression of renal failure cannot be ruled out with certainty.
During haemodialysis, patients treated with Dynepo may require increased anticoagulation treatment
is to prevent clotting of the arterio-venous shunt.
or Misuse of epoetin by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in haemoglobin and haematocrit.
th This may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
au 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
er No interaction studies have been performed.
No interactions have been reported during treatment with lo
ng Dynepo in the course of clinical trials.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation no
Pregnancy:
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.
In case of its use during pregnancy, concomitant iron substitution should be considered in the ct
mother.
Lactation:
It is not known whether Dynepo is excreted in human breast milk.
Since many compounds du
are excreted in human milk, caution should be advised when Dynepo is administered to breast-feeding women. ro
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines lp
Dynepo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. a in
4.8 Undesirable effects ic
Approximately 10% of patients can be expected to experience an adverse drug reaction.
The most ed
common are hypertension, access related thrombosis and headache.
Clinical experience with epoetins suggest hypertension and thrombosis risk may be reduced by titrating the dose to maintain M
haemoglobin levels between 10 to 12 g/ dl.
The frequency of adverse events that were experienced during Dynepo therapy is tabulated below.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:

4.9 Overdose no
The maximum dose of epoetin delta that can be safely administered in single or multiple doses has not been determined. ct
Treatment can result in polycythaemia if the haemoglobin/ haematocrit is not carefully monitored and du
the dose appropriately adjusted.
If the suggested target range is exceeded, treatment with epoetin delta should be temporarily withdrawn until the haemoglobin/ haematocrit returns to the suggested target ro
range.
Epoetin delta can then be reintroduced with a lower dosage (see section 4.2). lp
If severe polycythaemia occurs, conventional methods (phlebotomy) may be indicated to decrease the haemoglobin level. a in ic

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ed
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties M
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antianaemic - ATC code:
B03XA.
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
It acts as a mitosis stimulating factor and differentiation hormone.
The biological efficacy of erythropoietin has been demonstrated after intravenous and subcutaneous administration in various animal models in vivo (rats and dogs).
After administration of epoetin delta, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe- incorporation rate.
During the clinical trials, there were no indications of development of neutralising antibodies to epoetin delta in humans based on the clinical response.
46 When administration is halted, the eyrthropoietic parameters return toward baseline levels within the recovery period of 1-3 months.
Subcutaneous administration results in a similar pattern of erythropoietic stimulation as after intravenous administration.
Patients with cancer
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
ed Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies of epoetin alfa, beta and darbepoetin alfa involving a total of 2,833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo- controlled studies and one was an open-label study.
Two of the studies recruited patients who were
is being treated with chemotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dL;
or in the remaining three studies it was 12-14 g/ dL.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the
th four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess
au mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could
er not be satisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group. ng A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating lo in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk no
of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is therefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who are treated with recombinant ct
human erythropoietin.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve du
haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dL, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
Survival outcomes and tumour progression in ro
cancer patients that are being treated with Dynepo for anaemia associated with chronic renal failure have not been investigated.
The extent to which the outcomes observed in the clinical studies lp
discussed above may apply to this patient population is unclear, specifically considering that the dosages administered in the renal indication are lower than in the cancer indication. a in
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ic
The pharmacokinetics of erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta has been examined ed
in both healthy volunteers and patients with chronic renal failure.
Following intravenous doses, volume of distribution approximates total blood volume and ranges from 0.063 to 0.097 l/ kg.
The M
elimination half-life ranges from 4.7 to 13.2 hours in patients.
Half life is approximately 50% shorter in healthy subjects.
Measurable concentrations of erythropoietin are maintained in the serum for at least 24 hours following doses ranging from 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
Exposure to erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta increases proportionately in patients given intravenous doses of 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
No accumulation of epoetin delta was observed after repeated intravenous administration three times weekly.
Peak serum concentrations for subcutaneously administered epoetin delta occur between 8 and 36 hours following injection.
The half-life of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is prolonged compared to intravenous administration and ranges from 27 to 33 hours in patients.
The bioavailability of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is between 26% and 36%.
47 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal studies conducted with both Dynepo and epoetin alfa in pregnant female rats and rabbits did not show any teratogenic effect, but indicated class-related reversible effects on growth and haematopoiesis in the offspring.
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
au 4.1 Therapeutic indications
er Dynepo is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult patients.
It may be used in patients on dialysis and in patients not on dialysis. ng 4.2 Posology and method of administration lo
Treatment with Dynepo should be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of anaemia associated with CRF. no
The dosage of Dynepo must be adjusted individually to maintain the level of haemoglobin within the ct
target range of 10 to 12g/ dl. du
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician’ s evaluation of the individual patient’ s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Dynepo ro
should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ L).
Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving lp
haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. a
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and in
below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dL ic
(6.2 mmol/ l) to 12g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dL ed
(7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l) are observed, are described below (see Dose Management M
section below).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dL (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Dynepo is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
50 Dose Management
Starting dose is 50 IU/ kg three times a week if administered intravenously.
50 IU/ kg twice a week if administered subcutaneously.
It may not be necessary to use erythropoietin during the first three months after starting peritoneal dialysis because an increase in haemoglobin often occurs during this period.
Sufficient time should be allowed to determine a patient’ s responsiveness to a dosage of Dynepo before adjusting the dose.
Because of the time required for erythropoiesis, an interval of approximately 4 weeks may occur between the time of a dose adjustment (initiation, increase, decrease or discontinuation) and a significant change in haemoglobin.
In consequence, dose adjustment should not be made more frequently than once a month, unless clinically indicated.
ed Dose should be decreased by 25% – 50% or treatment temporarily withdrawn and then re-introduced
is with a lower dosage if:
or
- Haemoglobin reaches ≥ 12 g/ dl or
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin > 2 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
th Dose should be increased by 25% – 50% if:
au
- Haemoglobin falls below < 10 g/ dl and
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin is below 0.7 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
Administration er ng Dynepo may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
Subcutaneous self administration may lo be used after training by a medical professional.
The required weekly dose of Dynepo is lower when Dynepo is administered subcutaneously compared no
to intravenously. ct
For subcutaneous injection, the whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between thumb and forefinger, the skin fold should be held throughout the injection. du

M
4.3 Contra-indications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Uncontrolled hypertension.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in Section 4.2.
51 In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Hypertension
Most of patients with chronic renal failure have a history of hypertension.
Patients on Dynepo therapy
ed can experience increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Therefore, in patients treated with Dynepo, special care should be taken to monitor closely and control blood pressure.
Blood pressure should be controlled adequately before initiation and during therapy to
is avoid acute complications like hypertensive encephalopathy and related complications (seizures,
or stroke).
If these reactions occur they require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden sharp migraine-like headaches as a possible
th warning signal.
au Increases in blood pressure may require treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines or dosing increase of existing anti-hypertensive medications.
In addition, a reduction of the administered dose of Dynepo needs to be considered.
If blood pressure values remain high, a transient interruption of Dynepo therapy may be
er required.
Once hypertension is controlled with more intensified therapy, Dynepo therapy should be re-started at a ng reduced dose. lo
Iron evaluation no
During Dynepo therapy, absolute or functional iron deficiency may develop.
This is the most common cause of an incomplete response to an erythropoietin therapy.
Therefore, prior to and during Dynepo therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin ct
saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated.
Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and du
ferritin should be at least 100 ng/ ml.
If transferrin saturation falls below 20%, or if ferritin falls below 100 ng/ ml, iron should be administered.
Virtually all patients will eventually require supplemental iron to increase or maintain transferrin saturation and ferritin to levels that will adequately support ro
erythropoiesis stimulated by Dynepo. lp
Anaemia in epoetin-resistant or hyporesponsive patients with failure to respond to 20,000 IU/ week should be investigated, including referral to a haematologist. a
In the iron-replete patient with an inadequate response to Dynepo therapy, the following conditions in
should be evaluated and treated, if appropriated: ic
• Infection/ inflammation Occult blood loss ed
• • Hyperparathyroidism/ Osteitis fibrosa cystica Aluminium intoxication M
• • Haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia • Vitamin deficiencies, i. e., folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiencies • Haemolysis • Malignant diseases including multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome • Malnutrition
Laboratory monitoring
It is recommended that a complete blood count and platelet count is performed regularly.
52 The haemoglobin level should be determined once a week until it has stabilised in the suggested target range and the maintenance dose has been established.
After any dose adjustment, the haemoglobin should also be determined once weekly until it has stabilised in the target range.
The haemoglobin level should then be monitored at regular intervals.
Serum chemistry values including creatinine and potassium should be monitored regularly during Dynepo therapy.
Other
Although it has not been observed with Dynepo, since anaphylactoid reactions may occur with erythropoietin, it is recommended that the first dose be administered under medical supervision.
ed The use of Dynepo in nephrosclerotic patients not yet undergoing dialysis should be defined individually, as a possible acceleration of progression of renal failure cannot be ruled out with certainty.
is or During haemodialysis, patients treated with Dynepo may require increased anticoagulation treatment to prevent clotting of the arterio-venous shunt.
th Misuse of epoetin by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in haemoglobin and haematocrit.
au This may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
er ng No interaction studies have been performed.
No interactions have been reported during treatment with Dynepo in the course of clinical trials. lo
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation no
Pregnancy:
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy (see section 5.3).
The ct
potential risk for humans is unknown.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.
In case of its use during pregnancy, concomitant iron substitution should be considered in the du
mother.
Lactation:
It is not known whether Dynepo is excreted in human breast milk.
Since many compounds ro
are excreted in human milk, caution should be advised when Dynepo is administered to breast-feeding women. lp
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines a in
Dynepo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. ic
4.8 Undesirable effects ed
Approximately 10% of patients can be expected to experience an adverse drug reaction.
The most M
common are hypertension, access related thrombosis and headache.
Clinical experience with epoetins suggest hypertension and thrombosis risk may be reduced by titrating the dose to maintain haemoglobin levels between 10 to 12 g/ dl.

The maximum dose of epoetin delta that can be safely administered in single or multiple doses has not been determined. ct
Treatment can result in polycythaemia if the haemoglobin/ haematocrit is not carefully monitored and du
the dose appropriately adjusted.
If the suggested target range is exceeded, treatment with epoetin delta should be temporarily withdrawn until the haemoglobin/ haematocrit returns to the suggested target ro
range.
Epoetin delta can then be reintroduced with a lower dosage (see section 4.2). lp
If severe polycythaemia occurs, conventional methods (phlebotomy) may be indicated to decrease the haemoglobin level. a in ic

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ed
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties M
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antianaemic - ATC code:
B03XA.
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment.
It acts as a mitosis stimulating factor and differentiation hormone.
The biological efficacy of erythropoietin has been demonstrated after intravenous and subcutaneous administration in various animal models in vivo (rats and dogs).
After administration of epoetin delta, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe- incorporation rate.
54 During the clinical trials, there were no indications of development of neutralising antibodies to epoetin delta in humans based on the clinical response.
When administration is halted, the eyrthropoietic parameters return toward baseline levels within the recovery period of 1-3 months.
Subcutaneous administration results in a similar pattern of erythropoietic stimulation as after intravenous administration.
Patients with cancer
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors
ed may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies of epoetin alfa,
is beta and darbepoetin alfa involving a total of 2,833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-
or controlled studies and one was an open-label study.
Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dL;
th in the remaining three studies it was 12-14 g/ dL.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the
au four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess
er mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trials could ng not be satisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group. lo
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating no
in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls (95% CI:
0.99, 1.18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in ct
patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is therefore consistent evidence to suggest that there may be significant harm to patients with cancer who are treated with recombinant du
human erythropoietin.
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve ro
haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dL, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.
Survival outcomes and tumour progression in lp
cancer patients that are being treated with Dynepo for anaemia associated with chronic renal failure have not been investigated.
The extent to which the outcomes observed in the clinical studies a
discussed above may apply to this patient population is unclear, specifically considering that the in
dosages administered in the renal indication are lower than in the cancer indication. ic
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties ed
The pharmacokinetics of erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta has been examined M
in both healthy volunteers and patients with chronic renal failure.
Following intravenous doses, volume of distribution approximates total blood volume and ranges from 0.063 to 0.097 l/ kg.
The elimination half-life ranges from 4.7 to 13.2 hours in patients.
Half life is approximately 50% shorter in healthy subjects.
Measurable concentrations of erythropoietin are maintained in the serum for at least 24 hours following doses ranging from 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
Exposure to erythropoietin following administration of epoetin delta increases proportionately in patients given intravenous doses of 50 IU/ kg to 300 IU/ kg.
No accumulation of epoetin delta was observed after repeated intravenous administration three times weekly.
Peak serum concentrations for subcutaneously administered epoetin delta occur between 8 and 36 hours following injection.
The half-life of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is prolonged compared to intravenous administration and ranges from 27 to 33 hours in patients.
The
55 bioavailability of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta is between 26% and 36%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Animal studies conducted with both Dynepo and epoetin alfa in pregnant female rats and rabbits did not show any teratogenic effect, but indicated class-related reversible effects on growth and haematopoiesis in the offspring.
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
er Dynepo is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) ng in adult patients.
It may be used in patients on dialysis and in patients not on dialysis. lo
4.2 Posology and method of administration no
Treatment with Dynepo should be initiated by physicians experienced in the treatment of anaemia associated with CRF. ct
The dosage of Dynepo must be adjusted individually to maintain the level of haemoglobin within the du
target range of 10 to 12g/ dl. ro
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician’ s evaluation of the individual patient’ s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Dynepo lp
should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ L).
Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving a
haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. in ic
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed ed
through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dL (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dL M
(7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dL (7.5mmol/ l) are observed, are described below (see Dose Management section below).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dL (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made as provided.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Dynepo is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
58 Dose Management
Starting dose is 50 IU/ kg three times a week if administered intravenously.
50 IU/ kg twice a week if administered subcutaneously.
It may not be necessary to use erythropoietin during the first three months after starting peritoneal dialysis because an increase in haemoglobin often occurs during this period.
Sufficient time should be allowed to determine a patient’ s responsiveness to a dosage of Dynepo before adjusting the dose.
Because of the time required for erythropoiesis, an interval of approximately 4 weeks may occur between the time of a dose adjustment (initiation, increase, decrease or discontinuation) and a significant change in haemoglobin.
In consequence, dose adjustment should not
ed be made more frequently than once a month, unless clinically indicated.
Dose should be decreased by 25% – 50% or treatment temporarily withdrawn and then re-introduced
is with a lower dosage if:
or
- Haemoglobin reaches ≥ 12 g/ dl or
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin > 2 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
th Dose should be increased by 25% – 50% if:
au
- Haemoglobin falls below < 10 g/ dl and
- The rate of increase of haemoglobin is below 0.7 g/ dl in any 4 week period.
Administration er ng Dynepo may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
Subcutaneous self administration may lo be used after training by a medical professional. no
The required weekly dose of Dynepo is lower when Dynepo is administered subcutaneously compared to intravenously. ct
For subcutaneous injection, the whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between thumb and forefinger, the skin fold should be held throughout the injection. du
Discard the syringe after initial single use. ro
Special populations lp
Dynepo is not indicated for the management of anaemia associated with cancer. a in
No special dosage adjustments are required in elderly patients.
Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease and renal failure should where possible be maintained at ic
a total haemoglobin concentration between 7 and 9 g/ dl. ed
The experience in children is limited Due to limited experience, the safety and efficacy of Dynepo could not be assessed in patients with M
impaired liver function.
4.3 Contra-indications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Uncontrolled hypertension.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in Section 4.2.
59 In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dL (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
Hypertension
Most of patients with chronic renal failure have a history of hypertension.
Patients on Dynepo therapy can experience increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
ed Therefore, in patients treated with Dynepo, special care should be taken to monitor closely and control blood pressure.
Blood pressure should be controlled adequately before initiation and during therapy to avoid acute complications like hypertensive encephalopathy and related complications (seizures,
is stroke).
If these reactions occur they require the immediate attention of a physician and intensive
or medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden sharp migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
th Increases in blood pressure may require treatment with anti-hypertensive medicines or dosing increase of existing anti-hypertensive medications.
In addition, a reduction of the administered dose of Dynepo needs
au to be considered.
If blood pressure values remain high, a transient interruption of Dynepo therapy may be required.
er Once hypertension is controlled with more intensified therapy, Dynepo therapy should be re-started at a reduced dose. ng Iron evaluation lo
During Dynepo therapy, absolute or functional iron deficiency may develop.
This is the most common no
cause of an incomplete response to an erythropoietin therapy.
Therefore, prior to and during Dynepo therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated.
Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and ct
ferritin should be at least 100 ng/ ml.
If transferrin saturation falls below 20%, or if ferritin falls below 100 ng/ ml, iron should be administered.
Virtually all patients will eventually require supplemental iron du
to increase or maintain transferrin saturation and ferritin to levels that will adequately support erythropoiesis stimulated by Dynepo. ro
Anaemia in epoetin-resistant or hyporesponsive patients with failure to respond to 20,000 IU/ week should be investigated, including referral to a haematologist. lp
In the iron-replete patient with an inadequate response to Dynepo therapy, the following conditions a
should be evaluated and treated, if appropriated: in
• Infection/ inflammation ic
• Occult blood loss • Hyperparathyroidism/ Osteitis fibrosa cystica ed
• Aluminium intoxication • Haemoglobinopathies such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia M
• Vitamin deficiencies, i. e., folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiencies • Haemolysis • Malignant diseases including multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome • Malnutrition
Laboratory monitoring
It is recommended that a complete blood count and platelet count is performed regularly.
60 The haemoglobin level should be determined once a week until it has stabilised in the suggested target range and the maintenance dose has been established.
After any dose adjustment, the haemoglobin should also be determined once weekly until it has stabilised in the target range.
The haemoglobin level should then be monitored at regular intervals.
Serum chemistry values including creatinine and potassium should be monitored regularly during Dynepo therapy.
Other
Although it has not been observed with Dynepo, since anaphylactoid reactions may occur with erythropoietin, it is recommended that the first dose be administered under medical supervision.
ed The use of Dynepo in nephrosclerotic patients not yet undergoing dialysis should be defined individually, as a possible acceleration of progression of renal failure cannot be ruled out with certainty.
is or During haemodialysis, patients treated with Dynepo may require increased anticoagulation treatment to prevent clotting of the arterio-venous shunt.
th Misuse of epoetin by healthy persons may lead to an excessive increase in haemoglobin and haematocrit.
au This may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
er 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction ng No interaction studies have been performed. lo No interactions have been reported during treatment with Dynepo in the course of clinical trials. no
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy:
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy (see section 5.3).
The ct
potential risk for humans is unknown.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.
In case of its use during pregnancy, concomitant iron substitution should be considered in the du
mother.
Lactation:
It is not known whether Dynepo is excreted in human breast milk.
Since many compounds ro
are excreted in human milk, caution should be advised when Dynepo is administered to breast-feeding women. lp
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines a in
Dynepo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. ic
4.8 Undesirable effects ed
Approximately 10% of patients can be expected to experience an adverse drug reaction.
The most M
common are hypertension, access related thrombosis and headache.
Clinical experience with epoetins suggest hypertension and thrombosis risk may be reduced by titrating the dose to maintain haemoglobin levels between 10 to 12 g/ dl.
The frequency of adverse events that were experienced during Dynepo therapy is tabulated below.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:

1.
WHAT DYNEPO IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR ct
Epoetin delta is a human erythropoietin made by a technology process called gene-activation, which uses a human cell line. du
Epoetin delta is a hormone which stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow.
Red blood cells are very important since they contain haemoglobin, a protein which distributes oxygen in ro
your body. lp
Dynepo is used for treating the symptoms of anaemia (which include tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath) associated with chronic renal failure in adult patients, Anaemia is a blood disorder characterised by a
a decrease in red blood cells.
Dynepo may be used in patients on dialysis (a blood clearance technique) or in
in patients not on dialysis. ic ed
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE DYNEPO M
Do not take Dynepo:
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to epoetin delta or any of the other ingredients of Dynepo.
- if you have difficulties controlling your blood pressure.
Take special care with Dynepo:
Your doctor will closely monitor your haemoglobin concentration level to keep it within the target range of 10 to 12 g/ dl and may therefore need to change your dosage of Dynepo accordingly.
Occasionally, your individual haemoglobin values may be above and below this recommended target level.
Your doctor will manage your dosage so that haemoglobin concentrations will not consistently be above 12 g/ dl which may be associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events (e. g. heart attacks).
103 Your blood pressure needs to be checked closely before and during treatment with Dynepo.
If your blood pressure rises, your doctor may give you medicines to reduce your blood pressure or increase the dosage of your existing blood pressure lowering medication.
It may also be necessary to reduce your dose of Dynepo or to stop the treatment for a short period of time.
If you have severe headache, stabbing migraine-like headaches or fits, you should see your doctor at once.
It could be a consequence of a marked rise in your blood pressure.
Your doctor will measure your blood iron level during treatment with Dynepo and may give you iron supplements.
Your doctor will monitor the different chemical levels in your blood including: creatinine, potassium.
ed During dialysis, an increase in the dose of the anticoagulation treatment is frequently required since the increased number of red blood cells may cause blocking of the dialysis tubes.
is or Dynepo may not be suitable for patients under 18 years old, or for patients with renal or liver problems.
th Dynepo should not be used by healthy persons.
Severe reactions, possibly fatal, involving the heart and
au blood vessels may occur.
er Dynepo is not approved for use in cancer patients.
Taking other medicines
ng
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, lo even those not prescribed.
However, so far, no interactions with other medicines have been reported during treatment with no
Dynepo.
Taking Dynepo with food and drink ct
Food and drink has no influence on Dynepo. du
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Inform your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding or think you might be pregnant. ro
Your doctor will consider what is the best treatment for you during your pregnancy. lp

HOW TO TAKE DYNEPO ed
Your doctor will be experienced in the treatment of renal failure and the use of erythropoietin.
Your first dose will be given under medical supervision as rarely, an allergic-type reaction may occur.
M
Dynepo may be administered intravenously (into a vein) or subcutaneously (under the skin).
In patients not on haemodialysis, where intravenous access is not readily available, Dynepo is usually given subcutaneously.
When given subcutaneously, the site of injection should be changed with each injection.
Your dose of Dynepo will be determined by your doctor and will be adjusted individually according to your personal needs.
Your doctor should maintain your haemoglobin level within the target range of 10 to 12 g/ dl.
Occasionally, your individual haemoglobin values may be below and above this recommended target level.
However your haemoglobin level should not consistently exceed 12 g/ dl.
You will be monitored
104 closely to ensure the lowest dose of Dynepo is used to provide adequate control of your symptoms of anaemia.
Always take Dynepo exactly as your doctor has told you to.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
The usual starting dose is 50 IU/ kg three times a week if administered intravenously or 50 IU/ kg twice a week if administered subcutaneously.
The maintenance dose will be then decided by your doctor to maintain the level of your haemoglobin within the target range.
ed Mainly because of the time required for the production of new red blood cells, an interval of approximately 4 weeks may occur between the dose and an improvement in your anaemia.
Your doctor will probably not make changes to your dosage more than once a month.
is After any change to the dose, you will have frequent blood tests (once a week) until your haemoglobin
or level reaches the target range.
Your haemoglobin level should then be controlled at regular intervals.
th Dynepo therapy is usually a long-term treatment.
au If you take more Dynepo than you should Dynepo can be given in a very large range of doses.
If you accidentally give yourself too large a dose,
er tell your doctor.
It may be necessary to monitor your blood. ng If you forget to take Dynepo:
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose.
Take your next dose at the lo normal time. no
If you stop taking Dynepo Do not stop taking Dynepo before discussing the implications with your doctor or pharmacist. ct
Injecting Dynepo yourself Your doctor may decide that it would be best for you to inject Dynepo yourself.
Your doctor or nurse du
will show you how to inject yourself.
Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained. ro

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS in
Like all medicines, Dynepo can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. ic ed
If any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side effects not mentioned in this leaflet, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.
M
The most frequent side effects observed (in 1% to 10% of patients) with Dynepo are:

Even patients with normal blood pressure may have a marked rise in
their blood pressure and existing high blood pressure can get worse (See 2.
Before you take Dynepo).
- if you are on haemodialysis you may experience blockage of the dialysis tubes as your anaemia
improves (increase in red blood cells).
An increase in the dose of the anticoagulation treatment is frequently required to prevent the blockage occurring.
- headache
Other side effects that occur less frequently (in 0.1% to 1% of patients) include itching, pain, reaction at the site of injection (such as soreness and bleeding), flu-syndrome, diarrhoea, nausea.
105 Convulsions have been rarely reported (less than 1 every 1000 patients).
