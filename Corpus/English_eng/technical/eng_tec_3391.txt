(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns TRUE.
imap_delete() marks messages listed in msg_number for deletion.
The optional flags parameter only has a single option, FT_UID, which tells the function to treat the msg_number argument as a UID.
Messages marked for deletion will stay in the mailbox until either imap_expunge() is called or imap_close() is called with the optional parameter CL_EXPUNGE.
Note:
POP3 mailboxes do not have their message flags saved between connections, so imap_expunge() must be called during the same connection in order for messages marked for deletion to actually be purged.
Example 1. imap_delete() Beispiel
$mbox = imap_open ("{your.imap.host}INBOX", "username", "password") or die ("can't connect: ". imap_last_error()); $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo ($mbox); print "Messages before delete:". $check - Nmsgs. "br \n"; imap_delete ($mbox, 1); $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo ($mbox); print "Messages after delete: ". $check - Nmsgs." br \n "; imap_expunge ($mbox); $check = imap_mailboxmsginfo ($mbox); print "Messages after expunge:". $check - Nmsgs. "br \n"; imap_close ($mbox);
