PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids (oxicams) ATCvet code:
QM01AC06
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-exudative, analgesic and antipyretic properties.
Meloxicam also has anti-endotoxic properties because it has been shown to inhibit production of thromboxane B2 induced by E. coli endotoxin administration in calves and pigs.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Absorption After a single subcutaneous dose of 0.5 mg meloxicam/ kg, Cmax values of 2.1 µg/ ml were reached after 7.7 hours in young cattle.
Following single intramuscular doses of 0.4 mg meloxicam/ kg, a Cmax value of 1.1 to 1.5 µg/ ml was reached within 1 hour in pigs.
Distribution More than 98% of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins.
The highest meloxicam concentrations are to be found in liver and kidney.
Comparatively low concentrations are detectable in skeletal muscle and fat.
Metabolism Meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma.
In cattle, meloxicam is also a major excretion product in milk and bile whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound.
In pigs, bile and urine contain only traces of the parent compound.
Meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol, an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 26 hours after subcutaneous injection in young cattle.
In pigs, after intramuscular administration, the mean plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours.
Approximately 50% of the administered dose is eliminated via urine and the remainder via faeces.

Special precautions for use in animals If adverse reactions occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
7/ 125 Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of renal toxicity.
This product for dogs should not be used in cats as it is not suitable for use in this species.
In cats, Metacam 0.5 mg/ ml oral suspension for cats should be used.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals People with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Typical adverse drug reactions of NSAIDs such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, faecal occult blood, apathy and renal failure have occasionally been reported.
These side effects occur generally within the first treatment week and are in most cases transient and disappear following termination of the treatment but in very rare cases may be serious or fatal.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation (See 4.3).
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Metacam must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacological properties of the products used previously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight on the first day.
Treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration (at 24-hour intervals) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight.
For longer term treatment, once clinical response has been observed (after ≥ 4 days), the dose of Metacam can be adjusted to the lowest effective individual dose reflecting that the degree of pain and inflammation associated with chronic musculo-skeletal disorders may vary over time.
Particular care should be taken with regard to the accuracy of dosing.
Shake well before use.
To be administered orally either mixed with food or directly into the mouth.
The suspension can be given using either the drop dispenser of the bottle (for very small breeds) or the Metacam measuring syringe provided in the package.
Dosing procedure using the drop dispenser of the bottle:
Initial dose:
4 drops / kg body weight Maintenance dose:
2 drops / kg body weight
8/ 125 Dosing procedure using the measuring syringe:
The syringe fits onto the drop dispenser of the bottle and has a kg-body weight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose.
Thus for initiation of the therapy on the first day, twice the maintenance volume will be required.
Alternatively therapy may be initiated with Metacam 5 mg/ ml solution for injection.
A clinical response is normally seen within 3 - 4 days.
Treatment should be discontinued after 10 days at the latest if no clinical improvement is apparent.
Avoid introduction of contamination during use.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
In the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Not applicable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids (oxicams) ATCvet code:
QM01AC06
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-exudative and antipyretic effects.
It reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue.
To a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation.
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that meloxicam inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to a greater extent than cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Absorption Meloxicam is completely absorbed following oral administration and maximal plasma concentrations are obtained after approximately 4.5 hours.
When the product is used according to the recommended dosage regime, steady state concentrations of meloxicam in plasma are reached on the second day of treatment.
Distribution There is a linear relationship between the dose administered and plasma concentration observed in the therapeutic dose range.
Approximately 97% of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins.
The volume of distribution is 0.3 l/ kg.
Metabolism Meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma and is also a major biliary excretion product whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound.
Meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol, an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 24 hours.
Approximately 75% of the administered dose is eliminated via faeces and the remainder via urine.

In cattle, meloxicam is also a major excretion product in milk and bile whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound.
In pigs, bile and urine contain only traces of the parent compound.
Meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol, an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
The metabolism in horses has not been investigated.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 26 hours and 17.5 hours after subcutaneous injection in young cattle and lactating cows, respectively.
In pigs, after intramuscular administration the mean plasma elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 hours.
In horses, after intravenous injection meloxicam is eliminated with a terminal half-life of 8.5 hours.
Approximately 50% of the administered dose is eliminated via urine and the remainder via faeces.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids (oxicams) ATCvet code:
QM01AC06
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-exudative and antipyretic effects.
It reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue.
To a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation.
Meloxicam also has anti-endotoxic properties 23/ 125 because it has been shown to inhibit production of thromboxane B2 induced by intravenous E. coli endotoxin administration in calves and pigs.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Absorption When the product is used according to the recommended dosage regime the oral bioavailability is approximately 98%.
Maximal plasma concentrations are obtained after approximately 2 - 3 hours.
The accumulation factor of 1.08 suggests that meloxicam does not accumulate when administered daily.
Distribution Approximately 98% of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins.
The volume of distribution is 0.12 l/ kg.
Metabolism The metabolism is qualitatively similar in rats, mini-pigs, humans, cattle and pigs although quantitatively there are differences.
The major metabolites found in all species were the 5-hydroxy- and 5-carboxy-metabolites and the oxalyl-metabolite.
The metabolism in horses was not investigated.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a terminal half-life of 7.7 hours.

Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals People with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Typical adverse drug reactions of NSAIDs such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, faecal occult blood, apathy and renal failure have occasionally been reported.
These side effects occur generally within the first treatment week and are in most cases transient and disappear following termination of the treatment but in very rare cases may be serious or fatal.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation (See 4.3).
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Metacam must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacological properties of the products used previously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight on the first day.
Treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration (at 24-hour intervals) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight.
For longer term treatment, once clinical response has been observed (after ≥ 4 days), the dose of Metacam can be adjusted to the lowest effective individual dose reflecting that the degree of pain and inflammation associated with chronic musculo-skeletal disorders may vary over time.
Particular care should be taken with regard to the accuracy of dosing.
Shake well before use.
To be administered orally either mixed with food or directly into the mouth.
The suspension can be given using either the drop dispenser of the bottle (for very small breeds) or the Metacam measuring syringe provided in the package.
Dosing procedure using the drop dispenser of the bottle:
Initial dose:
10 drops / kg body weight Maintenance dose:
5 drops / kg body weight
27/ 125 Dosing procedure using the measuring syringe:
The syringe fits onto the drop dispenser of the bottle and has a kg-body weight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose.
Thus for initiation of the therapy on the first day, twice the maintenance volume will be required.
Alternatively therapy may be initiated with Metacam 5 mg/ ml solution for injection.
A clinical response is normally seen within 3 - 4 days.
Treatment should be discontinued after 10 days at the latest if no clinical improvement is apparent.
Avoid introduction of contamination during use.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
In the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)

5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Absorption Meloxicam is completely absorbed following oral administration and maximal plasma concentrations are obtained after approximately 4.5 hours.
When the product is used according to the recommended dosage regime, steady state concentrations of meloxicam in plasma are reached on the second day of treatment.
Distribution There is a linear relationship between the dose administered and plasma concentration observed in the therapeutic dose range.
Approximately 97% of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins.
The volume of distribution is 0.3 l/ kg.
Metabolism Meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma and is also a major biliary excretion product whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound.
Meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol, an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 24 hours.
Approximately 75% of the administered dose is eliminated via faeces and the remainder via urine.

Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacological properties of the products used previously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Initial treatment is a single oral dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight on the first day.
Treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration (at 24-hour intervals) at a maintenance dose of 0.05 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight.
Particular care should be taken with regard to the accuracy of dosing.
The recommended dose should not be exceeded.
Shake well before use.
To be administered orally either mixed with food or directly into the mouth.
The suspension can be given using the drop dispenser of the bottle for cats of any body weight.
Alternatively and for cats with a body weight of at least 2 kg, the Metacam measuring syringe (provided in the package) can be used.
Dosing procedure using the drop dispenser of the bottle:
Initial dose:
6 drops / kg body weight
37/ 125 Maintenance dose:
3 drops / kg body weight
Dosing procedure using the measuring syringe:
The syringe fits onto the drop dispenser of the bottle and has a kg-body weight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose.
Thus for initiation of the therapy on the first day, twice the maintenance volume will be required.
A clinical response is normally seen within 7 days.
Treatment should be discontinued after 14 days at the latest if no clinical improvement is apparent.
Avoid introduction of contamination during use.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Meloxicam has a narrow therapeutic safety margin in cats and clinical signs of overdose may be seen at relatively small overdose levels.
In case of overdose, adverse reactions, as listed in Section 4.6, are expected to be more severe and more frequent.
In the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Not applicable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products, non-steroids (oxicams) ATCvet code:
QM01AC06
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-exudative and antipyretic effects.
It reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue.
To a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation.
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that meloxicam inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to a greater extent than cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars Absorption If the animal is fasted when dosed, the maximal plasma concentrations are obtained after approximately 3 hours.
If the animal is fed at the time of dosing, the absorption may be slightly delayed.
Distribution There is a linear relationship between the dose administered and plasma concentration observed in the therapeutic dose range.
Approximately 97% of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins.
Metabolism Meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma and is also a major biliary excretion product whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound.
Meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol, an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 24 hours.
Approximately 75% of the administered dose is
38/ 125 eliminated via faeces and the remainder via urine.
Due to the loading dose, steady state is reached after 2 days (48h).

The Committee considered that at the concentration of the dose in the product to be administered to the target species, the excipient glycofurol was not pharmacologically active.
It therefore concluded, in accordance with its recent position paper on pharmacologically active excipients, that an MRL was not required to be established for this substance.

DOSAGE FOR EACH SPECIES, ROUTE(S) AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
Dosage Initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight on the first day.
Treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration (at 24-hour intervals) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight.
For longer term treatment, once clinical response has been observed (after ≥ 4 days), the dose of Metacam can be adjusted to the lowest effective individual dose reflecting that the degree of pain and inflammation associated with chronic musculo-skeletal disorders may vary over time.
Method and route of administration
Shake well before use.
To be administered orally either mixed with food or directly into the mouth.
The suspension can be given using either the drop dispenser of the bottle (for very small breeds) or the Metacam measuring syringe provided in the package.
Dosing procedure using the drop dispenser of the bottle:
Initial dose:
4 drops / kg body weight Maintenance dose:
2 drops / kg body weight
Dosing procedure using the measuring syringe:
The syringe fits onto the drop dispenser of the bottle and has a kg-body weight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose.
Thus for initiation of the therapy on the first day, twice the maintenance volume will be required.

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
Precautions for use in animals If adverse reactions occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of renal toxicity.
This product for dogs should not be used in cats as it is not suitable for use in this species.
In cats, Metacam 0.5 mg/ ml oral suspension for cats should be used.
Precautions to be taken by the person administering the product People with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show this package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Use during pregnancy and lactation See section "Contraindications".
Interactions Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Metacam must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacological properties of the products used previously.
Overdose In the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

104/ 125 12.
SPECIAL WARNING(S)
For post-operative pain relief in cats, safety has only been documented after thiopental/ halothane anaesthesia.
Precautions for use in animals If adverse reactions occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of renal toxicity.
Any oral follow-up therapy using meloxicam or other NSAIDs should not be administered in cats, as appropriate dosage regimens for such follow-up treatments have not been established.
Precautions to be taken by the person administering the product Accidental self-injection may give rise to pain.
People with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show this package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Use during pregnancy and lactation See section "Contraindications".
Interactions Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Metacam must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Concurrent administration of potential nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.
In animals at anaesthetic risk (e. g. aged animals) intravenous or subcutaneaous fluid therapy during anaesthesia should be taken into consideration.
When anaesthesia and NSAID are concomitantly administered, a risk for renal function cannot be excluded.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacological properties of the products used previously.
Overdose In the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

Dosage
Initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight on the first day.
Treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration (at 24-hour intervals) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg body weight.
For longer term treatment, once clinical response has been observed (after ≥ 4 days), the dose of Metacam can be adjusted to the lowest effective individual dose reflecting that the degree of pain and inflammation associated with chronic musculo-skeletal disorders may vary over time.
Method and route of administration
Shake well before use.
To be administered orally either mixed with food or directly into the mouth.
The suspension can be given using either the drop dispenser of the bottle (for very small breeds) or the Metacam measuring syringe provided in the package.

10 drops / kg body weight Maintenance dose:
5 drops / kg body weight

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
Precautions for use in animals If adverse reactions occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of renal toxicity.
Response to long-term therapy should be monitored at regular intervals by a veterinary surgeon.
Metacam 0.5 mg/ ml oral suspension for cats should not be used following parenteral injection of meloxicam or any other NSAID as appropriate dosage regimens for such follow-up treatments have not been established in cats.
Precautions to be taken by the person administering the product People with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show this package leaflet or the label to the physician.
Use during pregnancy and lactation See section "Contraindications".
Interactions Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Metacam must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Concurrent administration of potential nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacological properties of the products used previously.
Overdose Meloxicam has a narrow therapeutic safety margin in cats and clinical signs of overdose may be seen at relatively small overdose levels.
In case of overdose, adverse reactions, as listed in Section "Adverse reactions", are expected to be more severe and more frequent.
In the case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be initiated.
