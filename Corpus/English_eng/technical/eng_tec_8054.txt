364 ANNEX TO THE PACKAGE LEAFLET
How to use the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen
The following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen.
Please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.
Your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen.
Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.
The ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared.
Use the injection needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack only for the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen.
Make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it.
Your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take for your treatment.
Note:
The colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen.
Preparation: a.
Find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will need for the injection.
All of the supplies you will need are in the ViraferonPeg pack.
The pack contains: • ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen • one disposable injection needle • two cleansing swabs, and • dosing tray b.
The ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to come to room temperature before you use it.
Before taking the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen out of its carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton.
Do not use if the expiration date has passed. c Take the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen out of the carton.
Look in the window of the pen and make sure there is a white, to off-white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered.
This is the ViraferonPeg which will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. d.
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry.
It is important to keep your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.
Please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.
Step 1:
Mix the medicine Key points:
Before you mix the ViraferonPeg, make sure it is at room temperature.
It is important that you keep the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen upright (Dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).
365 •
•
Place the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on the bottom) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface.
You may want to hold the pen using the grip.
•
To mix the powder and the liquid, keep the ViraferonPeg pre- filled pen upright in the dosing tray and press the top half of the pen downward toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface until you hear the pen click.
Once
you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that
Dosing
both
dark stoppers are now touching.
The dosing button should be
button
flush with the pen body. • Wait for several seconds to let the powder dissolve. • Gently turn the pen upside down twice.
DO NOT
Figure 1
Holder
SHAKE THE PEN. • Keep the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down.
Then, look through the pen window to see that the mixed ViraferonPeg solution is competely dissolved.
If there is still foam, wait until it settles. • The solution should be clear and colourless before use.
Do not use the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles. • Before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the solution. • Place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.
Step 2:
Attach the needle
•
Keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the ViraferonPeg pre -filled pen with one cleansing swab.
•
Take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective paper tab, but DO NOT remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle.
Figure 2
•
Keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, FIRMLY push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane (figure 2) and screw it securely in place, in a clockwise direction.
• Keep the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen UPRIGHT (Dosing button down) and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. • Screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.
NOTE:
You may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen.
This is normal. • Wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • The dark stoppers move up and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3).
366 Stopper
Stopper
•
Check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.
If they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).
Figure 3
Step 3:
Set the dose
• •
Take the pen from the tray holder.
Holding the pen firmly, pull the dosing button out as far as it will go, until you see a dark ring on the pen.
The dosing button should be easy to pull out without too much force being needed (figure 4).
NOTE:
Do not push the dosing button back in at this time.
You will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the ViraferonPeg.
Dark ring

367
•
Turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab.
The button should turn easily without too much force being needed (figure 5).
If you have trouble dialing your dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out as far as it will go.
NOTE:
If you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen because it may not deliver the correct dose.
Figure 5
•
Carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non -slip surface.
DO NOT remove either of the needle caps and DO NOT push the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the ViraferonPeg dose.
Step 4:
Inject the ViraferonPeg solution
•
Select the injection site.
Your doctor will have told you which sites to use (e.g., thigh or abdomen).
The best sites for giving yourself an injection are those areas with a layer of fat between the skin and muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen.
Do not inject yourself in the area near your navel or waistline.
If you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection.
You should use a different site each time you inject ViraferonPeg to avoid soreness at any one site.
Do not inject ViraferonPeg into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.
•
Clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.
•
Pull off the outer needle cap (figure 6).
Outer needle cap
•
There may be some liquid around the inner needle cap.
Don’t worry, this is normal.
This liquid is not part of your dose, it is extra.
•
Once the injection site is dry, pull off the yellow inner needle cap carefully exposing the injection needle.
You are
Yellow inner needle cap
now ready to inject.
Figure 6
368
•
Hold the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen with your fingers wrapped around the pen body barrel and your thumb on the dosing button (figure 7).
•
With your other hand, pinch a fold of loose skin in the area you have cleaned for injection.
• •
Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°.
Press the dosing button down slowly and firmly until the button can no longer move.
•
Keep your thumb pressed down on the dosing button for an additional 5 seconds to ensure that you get the complete dose.
Figure 7
• Remove the needle from your skin. • Gently press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for a few seconds. • Do not massage the injection site.
If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. • Discard the ViraferonPeg pre -filled pen with the needle safely in a closed rigid container.
After 2 hours, check the injection site for redness, swelling, or tenderness.
If you have a skin reaction and it doesn’t clear up in a few days, contact your health care professional.

1.
WHAT VIRAFERONPEG IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Interferons modify the response of the body's immune system to help fight infections and severe diseases.
ViraferonPeg, which contains an interferon, is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, a viral infection of the liver, including in first time users co-infected with clinically stable HIV.
ViraferonPeg is best used for this treatment in combination with ribavirin.
This combination is indicated in first-time users.
This combination is also indicated in relapse patients and patients who have not responded previously to interferon alpha (pegylated or nonpegylated) and ribavirin combination therapy or interferon alpha monotherapy.
ViraferonPeg is used alone in case of intolerance or contraindication to ribavirin.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE VIRAFERONPEG
ViraferonPeg is not recommended for use in patients under the age of 18 years.
Do not use ViraferonPeg
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to peginterferon alfa-2b or any of the other ingredients of
ViraferonPeg.
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any interferon.
- If you have had severe heart problems, or if you have heart disease that has not been well controlled
during the past 6 months.
- If you have severe medical conditions that leave you very weak.
- If you have autoimmune hepatitis or any other problem with your immune system; if you are
taking medicine that suppresses your immune system (your immune system protects you against infection and some diseases).
- If you have advanced, uncontrolled liver disease (other than hepatitis C).
- If you have thyroid disease that is not well controlled with medicines.
- If you have a condition that causes convulsions (seizures, or “fits”).
370 Take special care with ViraferonPeg
- If you develop symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty in breathing, wheezing, or
hives) while on this medication, seek medical help immediately.
- If you ever had a heart attack or a heart problem.
- If you have ever been treated for depression or any other nervous or mental disorder.
- If you have kidney disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower than usual dose and monitor your
kidney blood values regularly during treatment.
If you have a kidney disease and you are using ViraferonPeg in combination with medicinal products containing ribavirin, your doctor should monitor you more carefully for a decrease in red blood cell count.
- If you have had a problem with your liver (other than hepatitis C).
- If you develop symptoms associated with a cold or other respiratory infection, such as fever, cough,
or any difficulty in breathing, tell your doctor.
- If you are diabetic, your doctor may ask you to have an eye examination.
- If you have had any serious illness affecting your breathing or your blood.
- If you have psoriasis, it may become worse while you are using ViraferonPeg.
- If you are planning to become pregnant, discuss this with your doctor before starting to use
ViraferonPeg.
- If you are also being treated for HIV, please see Using other medicines.
- If you have had a severe nervous or mental disorder.
- If you ever had depression or develop symptoms associated with depression (e.g. feelings of
sadness, dejection, etc) while on treatment with ViraferonPeg (see section 4).
- If you have received an organ transplant, either kidney or liver, interferon treatment may increase
the risk of rejection.
Be sure to discuss this with your doctor.
Dental and gum disorders, which may lead to loss of teeth, have been reported in patients receiving ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy.
In addition, dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and membranes of the mouth during long-term treatment with the combination of ViraferonPeg with ribavirin.
You should brush your teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations.
In addition some patients may experience vomiting.
If you have this reaction, be sure to rinse your mouth thoroughly afterwards.
While being treated with ViraferonPeg Your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids to help prevent low blood pressure.
Using other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, even those not prescribed.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
In studies in pregnant animals, interferons have sometimes caused miscarriage.
The effect on human pregnancy is not known.
In combination therapy with ribavirin, ribavirin can be very damaging to an unborn baby, thus both female and male patients must take special precautions in their sexual activity if there is any chance for pregnancy to occur:
- if you are a girl or a woman of childbearing age, you must have a negative pregnancy test before
treatment, each month during treatment, and for the 4 months after treatment is stopped.
You and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 4 months after stopping treatment.
This can be discussed with your doctor.
- if you are a man who is taking ribavirin, do not have sex with a pregnant woman unless you use a
condom.
This will lessen the chance for ribavirin to be left in the woman’s body.
If your female partner is not pregnant now but is of childbearing age, she must be tested for pregnancy each month during treatment and for the 7 months after treatment has stopped.
This can be discussed with your doctor.
If you are a male patient, you and your partner must each use an effective contraceptive during the time you are taking ribavirin and for 7 months after stopping treatment.
This can be discussed with your doctor.
371 It is not known whether this product is present in human milk.
Therefore, do not breast-feed an infant if you are taking ViraferonPeg.
In combination therapy with ribavirin, take notice of the respective informing texts of ribavirin containing medicinal products.
Driving and using machines Do not drive or operate any tools or machines if you feel tired, sleepy or confused while taking ViraferonPeg.
Important information about some of the ingredients of ViraferonPeg This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.7 ml, i.e., essentially "sodium-free".
This medicinal product contains sucrose.
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.
Patients who also have HIV infection Lactic acidosis and worsening liver function are side effects associated with Highly Active Anti- Retroviral Therapy (HAART), an HIV treatment.
If you are receiving HAART, the addition of ViraferonPeg and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis and of liver failure.
Your doctor will monitor you for signs and symptoms of these conditions.
(Please be sure to read the ribavirin Patient Leaflet also).
Additionally, patients treated with ViraferonPeg and ribavirin combination therapy and zidovudine could be at increased risk of developing anaemia (low number of red blood cells).
If you are also being treated for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (AIDS) with zidovudine or stavudine, it is not certain if ribavirin will change the way these medicines work.
Therefore, your blood will be checked regularly to be sure that the HIV infection is not getting worse.
If it gets worse, your doctor will decide whether or not your ribavirin treatment needs to be changed.
Co-administration of ribavirin and didanosine and/or stavudine is not recommended due to the risk of lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and pancreatitis.
3.

For HCV/HIV co-infected patients, the duration of treatment is 48 weeks.
372 In patients who have not responded previously or relapsed, the treatment should continue for one year (contingent upon the response after the first 12 weeks of therapy).
ViraferonPeg alone:
ViraferonPeg, when given alone, is usually given at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 microgram/kg once a week, for at least 6 months, and possibly for 1 year.
If you have kidney disease, your dose may be lower, depending upon your kidney function.
ViraferonPeg alone was not studied in HCV/HIV co-infected patients.
All patients:

Diabetes, abnormal heart rhythm, inflammation of pancreas, inflammation and degeneration of muscle tissue and peripheral nerves, kidney problems and seizures.
Very rarely reported side effects (less than 1 in every 10,000 patients):
Very rarely sarcoidosis (a disease characterised by persistent fever, weight loss, joint pain and swelling, skin lesions and swollen glands) has been reported.
Loss of consciousness has occurred very rarely with alpha interferons, mostly in elderly patients treated at high doses.
Cases of stroke (cerebrovascular events) have been reported.
Check with your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms or any other symptoms that are troubling.
Very rarely, ViraferonPeg alone or in combination with ribavirin may cause aplastic anaemia.
Pure red cell aplasia, a condition where the body stopped or reduced the production of red blood cells, has been reported.

When ViraferonPeg is used alone, some of these effects are less likely to occur, and some have not occurred at all.
If you are receiving HAART, the addition of ViraferonPeg and ribavirin may increase your risk of lactic acidosis, liver failure, and development of blood abnormalities (reduction in number of red blood cells which carry oxygen, certain white blood cells that fight infection, and blood clotting cells called platelets).
The following other side effects (not listed above) have occurred with the combination of ViraferonPeg and ribavirin capsules (adults) in HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving HAART: oral candidiasis (oral thrush), defective metabolism of fat, CD4 lymphocytes decreased, appetite decreased, back pain, hepatitis, limb pain, and various laboratory blood values abnormalities.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

377 ANNEX TO THE PACKAGE LEAFLET
How to use the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen
The following instructions explain how to inject yourself with the single use ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen.
Please read all of the instructions carefully before attempting to use the pen and follow them step by step.
Your doctor or his/her assistant will show you how to self-inject with the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen.
Do not attempt to inject yourself unless you are sure you understand everything fully.
The ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen should be used by one person only and must not be shared.
Use the injection needle and cleansing swabs provided in the pack only for the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen.
Make sure that the pen is at room temperature before you use it.
Your doctor will have told you what dose you need to take for your treatment.
Note:
The colour of the dosing button is different for each strength of the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen.
Preparation: a.
Find a clean, well-lit, non-slip flat working surface and get together all of the supplies you will need for the injection.
All of the supplies you will need are in the ViraferonPeg pack.
The pack contains: • ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen • one disposable injection needle • two cleansing swabs, and • dosing tray b.
The ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen should be stored in the refrigerator, but take it out and allow it to come to room temperature before you use it.
Before taking the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen out of its carton, check the expiration date printed on the carton.
Do not use if the expiration date has passed. c Take the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen out of the carton.
Look in the window of the pen and make sure there is a white, to off-white tablet that is whole, or in pieces, or powdered.
This is the ViraferonPeg which will be mixed with liquid inside the pen before it is injected. d.
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, rinse, and towel dry.
It is important to keep your work area, your hands, and the injection site clean to lessen the risk of infection.
Please follow the 4 major steps below to use the pen.
Step 1:
Mix the medicine Key points:
Before you mix the ViraferonPeg, make sure it is at room temperature.
It is important that you keep the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen upright (Dosing button down) (as shown in figure 1).
378 •
•
Place the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen upright in the holder of the tray provided in the pack (the dosing button will be on the bottom) on a hard, flat, non-slip surface.
You may want to hold the pen using the grip.
•
To mix the powder and the liquid, keep the ViraferonPeg pre- filled pen upright in the dosing tray and press the top half of the pen downward toward the hard, flat, non-slip surface until you hear the pen click.
Once
you have heard the click, you will notice in the window that

DO NOT
Figure 1
Holder
SHAKE THE PEN. • Keep the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen upright, with the dosing button down.
Then, look through the pen window to see that the mixed ViraferonPeg solution is competely dissolved.
If there is still foam, wait until it settles. • The solution should be clear and colourless before use.
Do not use the solution if it is discoloured, not clear, or contains particles. • Before attaching the needle, it is normal to see some small bubbles in the pre-filled pen window, near the top of the solution. • Place the pen back into the holder in the tray with the dosing button on the bottom.
Step 2:
Attach the needle
•
Keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, wipe the rubber membrane of the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen with one cleansing swab.
•
Take the injection needle provided in the tray and remove its protective paper tab, but DO NOT remove either the outer cap or the yellow inner cap from the injection needle.
Figure 2
•
Keeping the pen upright in the tray holder, FIRMLY push the injection needle straight onto the pen rubber membrane (figure 2) and screw it securely in place, in a clockwise direction.
• Keep the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen UPRIGHT (Dosing button down) and keep both needle caps on until you are ready to inject. • Screwing the needle into place, “primes” the needle and allows the extra liquid and air in the pen to be removed.
NOTE:
You may see some liquid trickle out from under the cap, as the air has been expelled out of the pen.
This is normal. • Wait about 5 seconds for this process to finish. • The dark stoppers move up and you will no longer see the fluid in the window once the needle is successfully primed (figure 3).
379 Stopper
Stopper
•
Check through the window to be sure that the two stoppers are together.
If they are not together, do not use this pen because you may not be able to dial your dose (figure 3).

Step 3:
Set the dose
• •
Take the pen from the tray holder.
Holding the pen firmly, pull the dosing button out as far as it will go, until you see a dark ring on the pen.
The dosing button should be easy to pull out without too much force being needed (figure 4).
NOTE:
Do not push the dosing button back in at this time.
You will push it in when you are ready to self-inject the ViraferonPeg.

•
Turn the dosing button until your prescribed dose is in line with the dosing tab.
The button should turn easily without too much force being needed (figure 5).
If you have trouble dialing your dose, check to make sure the dosing button has been pulled out as far as it will go.
NOTE:
If you cannot easily pull out the dosing button or dial the dose, do not use excessive force and do not use this pen because it may not deliver the correct dose.
Figure 5
•
Carefully lay the pen down on a hard, flat, non-slip surface.
DO NOT remove either of the needle caps and DO NOT push the dosing button in until you are ready to self-inject the ViraferonPeg dose.
Step 4:
Inject the ViraferonPeg solution
•
Select the injection site.
Your doctor will have told you which sites to use (e.g., thigh or abdomen).
The best sites for giving yourself an injection are those areas with a layer of fat between the skin and muscle, like your thigh, the outer surface of your upper arm, and abdomen.
Do not inject yourself in the area near your navel or waistline.
If you are very thin, you should only use the thigh or outer surface of the arm for injection.
You should use a different site each time you inject ViraferonPeg to avoid soreness at any one site.
Do not inject ViraferonPeg into an area where the skin is irritated, red, bruised, infected, or has scars, stretch marks, or lumps.
•
Clean the injection site skin with the second cleansing swab provided, and wait for the area to dry.
Outer needle cap
• •
Pull off the outer needle cap (figure 6).
There may be some liquid around the inner needle cap.
Don’t worry, this is normal.
This liquid is not part of your dose, it is extra.
Yellow inner needle cap
•
Once the injection site is dry, pull off the yellow inner needle cap carefully exposing the injection needle.
You are now ready to inject.
Figure 6
381
•
Hold the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen with your fingers wrapped around the pen body barrel and your thumb on the dosing button (figure 7).
•
With your other hand, pinch a fold of loose skin in the area you have cleaned for injection.
• •
Insert the needle into the pinched skin at an angle of 45° to 90°.
Press the dosing button down slowly and firmly until the button can no longer move.
•
Keep your thumb pressed down on the dosing button for an additional 5 seconds to ensure that you get the complete dose.
Figure 7
• Remove the needle from your skin. • Gently press the injection site with a small bandage or sterile gauze if necessary for a few seconds. • Do not massage the injection site.
If there is bleeding, cover with an adhesive bandage. • Discard the ViraferonPeg pre-filled pen with the needle safely in a closed rigid container.
After 2 hours, check the injection site for redness, swelling, or tenderness.
If you have a skin reaction and it doesn’t clear up in a few days, contact your health care professional.
