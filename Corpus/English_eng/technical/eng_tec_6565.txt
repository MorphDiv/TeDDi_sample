Title:
%1 - Edit Geographical Coordinates
Use the map on the right to select the location where the picture was taken. Click with left mouse button or move the marker on the map to get the GPS coordinates.

Configuration
Allows you to configure some aspects of the map: The Google Maps API version to be used and the service to be used for altitude lookup. Use the Google Maps API V2 if you want the search bar which is not yet available in version 3. If you do not need the search bar, you can use version 3 to try out the new terrain map. If you use no altitude lookup, all altitudes will be set to zero. The geonames. org service has no limits on the number of lookups which we can make, but has limited coverage. The topocoding. com service has better coverage, but the number of altitude lookups which we can perform per day is limited. If you get error messages while using it, switch to geonames. org.

Current GPX file:
No GPX file
Max. time gap (sec.):
Sets the maximum difference in seconds from a GPS track point to the image time to be matched. If the time difference exceeds this setting, no match will be attempted.
Camera time zone:
Same as system
Use this option if the timezone of the camera is the same as the timezone of this system. The conversion to GMT will be done automatically.
Manual:
Use this option if the timezone of the camera is different from this system and you have to specify the difference to GMT manually.
Sets the time zone the camera was set to during photo shooting, so that the time stamps of the images can be converted to GMT to match the GPS time reference. Note: positive offsets count eastwards from zero longitude (GMT), they are'ahead of time '.
Fine offset (mm: ss):
Sets an additional offset in minutes and seconds that is used to correlate the photos to the GPS track. This can be used for fine tuning to adjust a wrong camera clock.
Set whether the camera offset is negative or positive.
Minutes to fine tune camera offset.
Seconds to fine tune camera offset.
Interpolate
Set this option to interpolate GPS track points which are not closely matched to the GPX data file.
Difference in min.:
Sets the maximum time difference in minutes (240 max.) to interpolate GPX file points to image time data.
