Image Size
You should keep in mind that an image can be located in one of four places: in the image file, in RAM after it has been loaded, on your screen when it is displayed, or on paper after it has been printed. Scaling the image changes the number of pixels (the amount of information) the image contains, so it directly affects the amount of memory the image needs (in RAM or in a file).
However printing size also depends upon the resolution of the image, which essentially determines how many pixels there will be on each inch of paper. If you want to change the printing size without scaling the image and changing the number of pixels in it, you should use the

You may need to reduce your image if you intend to use it on a web page. You have to consider that most internet users have relatively small screens which cannot completely display a large image. Many screens have a resolution of 1024x768 or even less.

The output resolution determines the number of pixels used per unit length for the printed image. Do not confuse the output resolution with the printer resolution, which is expressed in dpi (dots per inch); several dots are used to print a pixel.
When the dialog is displayed, the resolution shown in the boxes is the resolution of the original image. If you increase the output resolution, the printed page will be smaller, since more pixels are used per unit of length. Conversely, and for the same reason, resizing the image modifies the resolution.
Increasing the resolution results in increasing the sharpness of the printed page. This is quite different from simply reducing the image size by scaling it, since no pixels (and no image information) are removed.
You can set the printing Width and Height by using the text boxes. You can also choose the units for these values from the dropdown list.
As soon as you change the Width or the Height, the X and/or Y resolution values automatically change accordingly. If the two resolution values remain linked, the relationship of the width to the height of the image is also automatically maintained. If you would like to set these values independently of each other, simply click on the chain symbol to break the link.
You can set the resolution used to calculate the printed width and height from the physical size of the image, that is, the number of pixels in it.
Use the text boxes to change these resolution values. They can be linked to keep their relationship constant. The closed chain symbol between the two boxes indicates that the values are linked together. If you break the link by clicking on the chain symbol, you will be able to set the values independently of each other.

Dithering Options
Since an indexed image contains 256 colors or less, some colors in the original image may not be available in the palette. This may result in some blotchy or solid patches in areas which should have subtle color changes. The dithering options let you correct the unwanted effects created by the Palette Options.
A dithering filter tries to approximate a color which is missing from the palette by instead using clusters of pixels of similar colors which are in the palette. When seen from a distance, these pixels give the impression of a new color. See the Glossary for more information on
