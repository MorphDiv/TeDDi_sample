Warning
This function is EXPERIMENTAL.
The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP.
Use this function at your own risk.
Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE on failure.
ingres_query() sends the given query to the Ingres server.
This query must be a valid SQL query (see the Ingres SQL reference guide)
The query becomes part of the currently open transaction.
If there is no open transaction, ingres_query() opens a new transaction.
To close the transaction, you can either call ingres_commit() to commit the changes made to the database or ingres_rollback() to cancel these changes.
When the script ends, any open transaction is rolled back (by calling ingres_rollback()).
You can also use ingres_autocommit() before opening a new transaction to have every SQL query immediatly commited.
Some types of SQL queries can 't be sent with this function:
close (see ingres_close())
commit (see ingres_commit())
connect (see ingres_connect())
disconnect (see ingres_close())
get dbevent
prepare to commit
rollback (see ingres_rollback())
savepoint
set autocommit (see ingres_autocommit())
all cursor related queries are unsupported
Example 1. ingres_query() example
?php ingres_connect ($database, $user, $password); ingres_query ("select * from table"); while ($row = ingres_fetch_row()) {echo $row[1]; echo $row[2];}?
See also ingres_fetch_array(), ingres_fetch_object(), ingres_fetch_row(), ingres_commit(), ingres_rollback(), and ingres_autocommit().
