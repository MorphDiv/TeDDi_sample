(PHP 3 = 3.0.4, PHP 4)
Returns the data from record in an associative array.
The array also includes an associative member named 'deleted' which is set to 1 if the record has been marked for deletion (see dbase_delete_record()).
Each field is converted to the appropriate PHP type, except:
Dates are left as strings
Integers that would have caused an overflow (32 bits) are returned as strings
