Mahjongg is a solitaire version of the classic Eastern tile game. It involves clearing as much of the board as possible by matching corresponding tiles and taking them out of play.

Introduction

A Brief History of Mahjongg
Mahjongg tile sets are used to play many variations of the original game. The version of Mahjongg you play is the solitaire one. Each tile also has a
Mahjongg's origins are not fully known, but many theories have been put forth. One such theory says that Noah played Mahjongg on the ark because the East hand is dominant, presumably the direction the rains came, in the flood. Another theory says that the Chinese philosopher, Confucius, made the game. The three
In the early 1900's Mahjongg was introduced into English clubs in Shanghai. Mr. Babcock started the importation of Mahjongg tiles to the Western world. He stripped down the rules to the very basics and even put Arabic numerals on the tiles. 1923 was the height of the Mahjongg craze with major gaming companies, like Parker Bros., Milton Bradley, and United States Playing Card, importing Mahjongg tile sets by the thousands.
Portions of this text were adapted from the
Many different rules sprang up and in 1924 the Standardization Committee of the American Official Laws of Mah-Jongg was formed to write a rule book. Still today many clubs play by different rules and sometimes even add flower or joker tiles. Players of the computer version are becoming intrigued with the beauty and detail of the hand crafted sets of the 1920's and 1930's and are searching antique shops and flea markets for sets of their own. Many new players are being introduced to the game solely through the solitaire version and are slowly realizing the intrigue and challenge that the traditional game offers.
Playing Mahjongg
You start with five levels of tiles which are stacked so some are covered up by the tiles on top. The harder the level you set in the

Main window.

Only tiles at the far left and right edges on each level can be selected. This is because you can't remove any tiles which aren't at the far left and far right sides. If the tiles are on a different level and at the left or right sides, those can be removed when you find another matching tile.
If you can't match any more tiles, a dialog will appear telling you no more tiles can be matched and giving you the option of shuffling the tiles (adding an additional 60 seconds penalty to the game clock), starting a new game or undoing your last move (although you may have to undo many more moves to find your mistake).
