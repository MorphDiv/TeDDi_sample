Const statement
Const Statement [Run-time]
Defines a string as a constant.
Syntax:
Const Text = Expression
Parameters:
Text:
Any constant name that follows the standard variable naming conventions.
A constant is a variable that helps to improve the readability of a program.
Constants are not defined as a specific type of variable, but rather are used as placeholders in the code.
You can only define a constant once and it cannot be modified.
Use the following statement to define a constant:
CONST ConstName=Expression
The type of expression is irrelevant.
If a program is started, $[officename] Basic converts the program code internally so that each time a constant is used, the defined expression replaces it.
Example:
Sub ExampleConst
Const iVar = 1964
Msgbox iVar
Const sVar = &quot; Program &quot; , dVar As Double = 1.00
Msgbox sVar & &quot; &quot; & dVar
end sub
