ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
BeneFIX 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 250 IU nonacog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor IX).
After reconstitution with the accompanying 5 ml water for injection, each ml of the solution contains approximately 50 IU nonacog alfa.
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one-stage clotting assay.
The specific activity of BeneFIX is not less than 200 IU/ mg protein.
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (INN = nonacog alfa).
Nonacog alfa is a purified protein that has 415 amino acids in a single chain.
It has a primary amino acid sequence that is comparable to the Ala148 allelic form of plasma-derived factor IX, and some post-translational modifications of the recombinant molecule are different from those of the plasma-derived molecule.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a glycoprotein that is secreted by genetically engineered mammalian cells derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.
Excipients:
Each vial contains 25 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
White/ almost white powder and clear and colourless solvent for solution for injection.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient's clinical condition.
Dosing of BeneFIX may differ from that of plasma-derived factor IX products.
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity level has been achieved, precise monitoring using the factor IX activity assay is advised and doses should be calculated taking the factor IX activity, pharmacokinetic
2 parameters such as half-life and recovery, as well as the clinical situation into consideration in order to adjust the dose as appropriate.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Factor IX products rarely require to be administered more than once daily.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products.
Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an international standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of normal human plasma.
Estimation of the required dose of BeneFIX can be based on the finding that one unit of factor IX activity per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX, an average of 0.8 IU/ dl (range from 0.4 to 1.4 IU/ dl) in adult patients (≥ 15 years).
Pharmacokinetics have to be assessed regularly in each patient and posology has to be adjusted accordingly.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
reciprocal of observed recovery
For a recovery 0.7 IU/ dl (average increase of factor IX), then:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
1.4 IU/ kg
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given plasma activity levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor IX level required (%) or (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of Therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 24 hours for 3- 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved.
3 Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Surgery
Factor IX level required (%) or (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of Therapy (days)
Minor:
Including tooth extraction
30-60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80-100
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours
(pre- and
until adequate wound healing, then
postoperative)
therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor IX activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl)
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor IX, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, BeneFIX may be administered.
In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/ kg (range 13 to 78 IU/ kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days.
In younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Paediatric patients
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
In clinical studies, 57% of the paediatric patients increased their doses due to lower than expected recovery or to obtain sufficient therapeutic response or both, some to an average dose of > 50 IU/ kg.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity should be performed, as well as calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters such as recovery and half-life, as clinically indicated, in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If doses > 100 IU/ kg have been repeatedly needed during routine prophylaxis or treatment, a switch to another FIX product should be considered.
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
If the expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, biological testing should be performed to determine if a factor IX inhibitor is present.
In patients with high levels of inhibitor factor IX therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options must be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
See also section 4.4.
Method of administration
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous infusion after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for solution for injection with sterile water for injection (see section 6.6).
BeneFIX should be administered at a slow infusion rate.
In most of the cases, an infusion rate of up to 4 ml per minute has been used.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
4 4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Known allergic reaction to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients (PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, patients treated with BeneFIX should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors that should be titrated in Bethesda Units using appropriate biological testing.
Sufficient data have not been obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
Additional safety and efficacy studies in paediatric patients are ongoing in previously treated, minimally treated, and previously untreated paediatric patients.
Clinical studies of BeneFIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
As with any patient receiving BeneFIX, dose selection for an elderly patient should be individualised.
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
Patients should be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX has to be discontinued immediately and an appropriate treatment has to be initiated.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
In the case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock should be observed.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions.
Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product.
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.
Posology has to be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetics of each patient.
Although BeneFIX contains only factor IX, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be recognised.
Since the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications, the use of factor IX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications,
5 clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to neonates, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC.
In each of these situations, the benefit of treatment with BeneFIX should be weighed against the risk of these complications.
There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction.
The safety and efficacy of using BeneFIX for immune tolerance induction has not been established.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that, whenever possible, every time that BeneFIX is administered to them, the name and batch number of the product is registered.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available.
Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
To date, no adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX occurred with a frequency of ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 (common).
The frequency of adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX would be categorized as uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100) or rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
Of these the most significant include: anaphylaxis, cellulitis, phlebitis, and neutralising antibodies.
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials and postmarketing experience are presented below by system organ class and frequency of occurrence.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per- infusion basis and are described using the following categories: uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
Nervous system disorders
Uncommon:
Dizziness, headache, altered taste, lightheadedness
6 Gastrointestinal disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Nausea Vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions
Uncommon:
Cellulitis, phlebitis, injection site reaction (including burning infusion site and injection site stinging), injection site discomfort
Rare:
Pyrexia
Immune system disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Neutralising antibodies (factor IX inhibition)* Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions; such reactions may include anaphylaxis*, bronchospasm/ respiratory distress, hypotension, angioedema, tachycardia, chest tightness, generalised urticarial, hives, rash, burning sensation in jaw and skull, chills (rigors), tingling, flushing, lethargy, restlessness, dry cough/ sneezing
* See additional
information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also section 4.4).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX should be discontinued at once.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also section 4.4).
Due to the production process BeneFIX contains trace amounts of hamster cell proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients (including 9 patients participating only in the surgery study) who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no anamnestic rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in PUPs.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
7 Renal
In a clinical trial, twelve days after a dose of BeneFIX for a bleeding episode, one hepatitis C antibody positive patient developed a renal infarct.
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
The patient continued to be treated with BeneFIX.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagic Blood Coagulation Factor IX; ATC code:
B02BD09
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (nonacog alfa).
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 55,000 Daltons that is a member of the serine protease family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic which has structural and functional characteristics comparable to endogenous factor IX.
Factor IX is activated by factor VII/ tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway as well as factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X.
This results ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Factor IX activity is absent or greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia B and substitution therapy may be required.
Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
This medicinal product has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Infusion of BeneFIX into 56 PTP patients (baseline data) with haemophilia B has shown an in vivo recovery ranging from 15 to 62% (mean 33.7 +/ - 10.3%).
One International Unit of BeneFIX showed a mean 0.75 IU/ dl (range 0.3 to 1.4 IU/ dl) increase in the circulating level of factor IX.
The biologic half- life ranged from 11 to 36 hours (mean of 19.3 +/ - 5.0 hours).
For a subset of the 56 patients, data are available from baseline to 24 months.
The pharmacokinetic data for these patients at various time points are shown in the following table:

A 28% lower recovery of recombinant Factor IX in comparison to plasma derived Factor IX was shown.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of recombinant Factor IX have also been determined after single and multiple intravenous doses in different species.
The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in studies comparing
9 recombinant Factor IX to plasma derived Factor IX were similar to those obtained in human studies.
Structural differences of the recombinant Factor IX molecule compared with plasma derived Factor IX appear to contribute to the different recovery compared to plasma derived Factor IX.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment and foetal development have been conducted.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
BeneFIX 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 500 IU nonacog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor IX).
After reconstitution with the accompanying 5 ml water for injection, each ml of the solution contains approximately 100 IU/ ml nonacog alfa.
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one-stage clotting assay.
The specific activity of BeneFIX is not less than 200 IU/ mg protein.
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (INN = nonacog alfa).
Nonacog alfa is a purified protein that has 415 amino acids in a single chain.
It has a primary amino acid sequence that is comparable to the Ala148 allelic form of plasma-derived factor IX, and some post-translational modifications of the recombinant molecule are different from those of the plasma-derived molecule.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a glycoprotein that is secreted by genetically engineered mammalian cells derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.
Excipients:
Each vial contains 50 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
White/ almost white powder and clear and colourless solvent for solution for injection.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient's clinical condition.
Dosing of BeneFIX may differ from that of plasma-derived factor IX products.
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity level has been achieved, precise monitoring using the factor IX activity assay is advised and doses should be calculated taking the factor IX activity, pharmacokinetic
13 parameters such as half-life and recovery, as well as the clinical situation into consideration in order to adjust the dose as appropriate.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Factor IX products rarely require to be administered more than once daily.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products.
Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an international standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of normal human plasma.
Estimation of the required dose of BeneFIX can be based on the finding that one unit of factor IX activity per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX, an average of 0.8 IU/ dl (range from 0.4 to 1.4 IU/ dl) in adult patients (≥ 15 years).
Pharmacokinetics have to be assessed regularly in each patient and posology has to be adjusted accordingly.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:

therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor IX activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl)
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor IX, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, BeneFIX may be administered.
In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/ kg (range 13 to 78 IU/ kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days.
In younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Paediatric patients
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
In clinical studies, 57% of the paediatric patients increased their doses due to lower than expected recovery or to obtain sufficient therapeutic response or both, some to an average dose of > 50 IU/ kg.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity should be performed, as well as calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters such as recovery and half-life, as clinically indicated, in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If doses > 100 IU/ kg have been repeatedly needed during routine prophylaxis or treatment, a switch to another FIX product should be considered.
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
If the expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, biological testing should be performed to determine if a factor IX inhibitor is present.
In patients with high levels of inhibitor factor IX therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options must be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
See also section 4.4.
Method of administration
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous infusion after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for solution for injection with sterile water for injection (see section 6.6).
BeneFIX should be administered at a slow infusion rate.
In most of the cases, an infusion rate of up to 4 ml per minute has been used.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
15 4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Known allergic reaction to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients (PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, patients treated with BeneFIX should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors that should be titrated in Bethesda Units using appropriate biological testing.
Sufficient data have not been obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
Additional safety and efficacy studies in paediatric patients are ongoing in previously treated, minimally treated, and previously untreated paediatric patients.
Clinical studies of BeneFIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
As with any patient receiving BeneFIX, dose selection for an elderly patient should be individualised.
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
Patients should be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX has to be discontinued immediately and an appropriate treatment has to be initiated.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
In the case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock should be observed.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions.
Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product.
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.
Posology has to be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetics of each patient.
Although BeneFIX contains only factor IX, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be recognised.
Since the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications, the use of factor IX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in patients with
16 disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to neonates, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC.
In each of these situations, the benefit of treatment with BeneFIX should be weighed against the risk of these complications.
There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction.
The safety and efficacy of using BeneFIX for immune tolerance induction has not been established.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that, whenever possible, every time that BeneFIX is administered to them, the name and batch number of the product is registered.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.
Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
To date, no adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX occurred with a frequency of ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 (common).
The frequency of adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX would be categorized as uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100) or rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
Of these the most significant include: anaphylaxis, cellulitis, phlebitis, and neutralising antibodies.
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials and postmarketing experience are presented below by system organ class and frequency of occurrence.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per- infusion basis and are described using the following categories: uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).

* See additional
information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also section 4.4).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX should be discontinued at once.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also section 4.4).
Due to the production process BeneFIX contains trace amounts of hamster cell proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients (including 9 patients participating only in the surgery study) who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no anamnestic rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in PUPs.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
18 Renal
In a clinical trial, twelve days after a dose of BeneFIX for a bleeding episode, one hepatitis C antibody positive patient developed a renal infarct.
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
The patient continued to be treated with BeneFIX.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagic Blood Coagulation Factor IX; ATC code:
B02BD09
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (nonacog alfa).
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 55,000 Daltons that is a member of the serine protease family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic which has structural and functional characteristics comparable to endogenous factor IX.
Factor IX is activated by factor VII/ tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway as well as factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X.
This results ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Factor IX activity is absent or greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia B and substitution therapy may be required.
Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
This medicinal product has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Infusion of BeneFIX into 56 PTP patients (baseline data) with haemophilia B has shown an in vivo recovery ranging from 15 to 62% (mean 33.7 +/ - 10.3%).
One International Unit of BeneFIX showed a mean 0.75 IU/ dl (range 0.3 to 1.4 IU/ dl) increase in the circulating level of factor IX.
The biologic half- life ranged from 11 to 36 hours (mean of 19.3 +/ - 5.0 hours).
For a subset of the 56 patients, data are available from baseline to 24 months.
The pharmacokinetic data for these patients at various time points are shown in the following table:

20 A 28% lower recovery of recombinant Factor IX in comparison to plasma derived Factor IX was shown.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of recombinant Factor IX have also been determined after single and multiple intravenous doses in different species.
The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in studies comparing recombinant Factor IX to plasma derived Factor IX were similar to those obtained in human studies.
Structural differences of the recombinant Factor IX molecule compared with plasma derived Factor IX appear to contribute to the different recovery compared to plasma derived Factor IX.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment and foetal development have been conducted.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
BeneFIX 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 1000 IU nonacog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor IX).
After reconstitution with the accompanying 10 ml water for injection, each ml of the solution contains approximately 100 IU/ ml nonacog alfa.
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one-stage clotting assay.
The specific activity of BeneFIX is not less than 200 IU/ mg protein.
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (INN = nonacog alfa).
Nonacog alfa is a purified protein that has 415 amino acids in a single chain.
It has a primary amino acid sequence that is comparable to the Ala148 allelic form of plasma-derived factor IX, and some post-translational modifications of the recombinant molecule are different from those of the plasma-derived molecule.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a glycoprotein that is secreted by genetically engineered mammalian cells derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.
Excipients:
Each vial contains 100 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient's clinical condition.
Dosing of BeneFIX may differ from that of plasma-derived factor IX products.
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity level has been achieved, precise monitoring using the factor IX activity assay is advised and doses should be calculated taking the factor IX activity, pharmacokinetic
24 parameters such as half-life and recovery, as well as the clinical situation into consideration in order to adjust the dose as appropriate.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Factor IX products rarely require to be administered more than once daily.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products.
Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an international standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of normal human plasma.
Estimation of the required dose of BeneFIX can be based on the finding that one unit of factor IX activity per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX, an average of 0.8 IU/ dl (range from 0.4 to 1.4 IU/ dl) in adult patients (≥ 15 years).
Pharmacokinetics have to be assessed regularly in each patient and posology has to be adjusted accordingly.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
reciprocal of observed recovery
For a recovery 0.7 IU/ dl (average increase of factor IX), then:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
1.4 IU/ kg
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given plasma activity levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor IX level required (%) or (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of Therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 24 hours for 3- 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved.

Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours
(pre- and

therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor IX activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl)
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor IX, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, BeneFIX may be administered.
In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/ kg (range 13 to 78 IU/ kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days.
In younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Paediatric patients
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
In clinical studies, 57% of the paediatric patients increased their doses due to lower than expected recovery or to obtain sufficient therapeutic response or both, some to an average dose of > 50 IU/ kg.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity should be performed, as well as calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters such as recovery and half-life, as clinically indicated, in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If doses > 100 IU/ kg have been repeatedly needed during routine prophylaxis or treatment, a switch to another FIX product should be considered.
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
If the expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, biological testing should be performed to determine if a factor IX inhibitor is present.
In patients with high levels of inhibitor factor IX therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options must be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
See also section 4.4.
Method of administration
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous infusion after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for solution for injection with sterile water for injection (see section 6.6).
BeneFIX should be administered at a slow infusion rate.
In most of the cases, an infusion rate of up to 4 ml per minute has been used.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Known allergic reaction to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients (PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, patients treated with BeneFIX should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors that should be titrated in Bethesda Units using appropriate biological testing.
Sufficient data have not been obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
Additional safety and efficacy studies in paediatric patients are ongoing in previously treated, minimally treated, and previously untreated paediatric patients.
Clinical studies of BeneFIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
As with any patient receiving BeneFIX, dose selection for an elderly patient should be individualised.
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
Patients should be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX has to be discontinued immediately and an appropriate treatment has to be initiated.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
In the case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock should be observed.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions.
Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product.
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.
Posology has to be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetics of each patient.
Although BeneFIX contains only factor IX, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be recognised.
Since the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications, the use of factor IX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in patients with
27 disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to neonates, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC.
In each of these situations, the benefit of treatment with BeneFIX should be weighed against the risk of these complications.
There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction.
The safety and efficacy of using BeneFIX for immune tolerance induction has not been established.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that, whenever possible, every time that BeneFIX is administered to them, the name and batch number of the product is registered.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available.
Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
To date, no adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX occurred with a frequency of ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 (common).
The frequency of adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX would be categorized as uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100) or rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
Of these the most significant include: anaphylaxis, cellulitis, phlebitis, and neutralising antibodies.
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials and postmarketing experience are presented below by system organ class and frequency of occurrence.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per- infusion basis and are described using the following categories: uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
28 Nervous system disorders
Uncommon:
Dizziness, headache, altered taste, lightheadedness
Gastrointestinal
disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:

* See additional
information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also section 4.4).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX should be discontinued at once.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also section 4.4).
Due to the production process BeneFIX contains trace amounts of hamster cell proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients (including 9 patients participating only in the surgery study) who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no anamnestic rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in PUPs.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
29 Renal
In a clinical trial, twelve days after a dose of BeneFIX for a bleeding episode, one hepatitis C antibody positive patient developed a renal infarct.
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
The patient continued to be treated with BeneFIX.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagic Blood Coagulation Factor IX; ATC code:
B02BD09
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (nonacog alfa).
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 55,000 Daltons that is a member of the serine protease family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic which has structural and functional characteristics comparable to endogenous factor IX.
Factor IX is activated by factor VII/ tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway as well as factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X.
This results ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Factor IX activity is absent or greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia B and substitution therapy may be required.
Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
This medicinal product has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Infusion of BeneFIX into 56 PTP patients (baseline data) with haemophilia B has shown an in vivo recovery ranging from 15 to 62% (mean 33.7 +/ - 10.3%).
One International Unit of BeneFIX showed a mean 0.75 IU/ dl (range 0.3 to 1.4 IU/ dl) increase in the circulating level of factor IX.
The biologic half- life ranged from 11 to 36 hours (mean of 19.3 +/ - 5.0 hours).
For a subset of the 56 patients, data are available from baseline to 24 months.
The pharmacokinetic data for these patients at various time points are shown in the following table:

A 28% lower recovery of recombinant Factor IX in comparison to plasma derived Factor IX was shown.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of recombinant Factor IX have also been determined after single and
31 multiple intravenous doses in different species.
The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in studies comparing recombinant Factor IX to plasma derived Factor IX were similar to those obtained in human studies.
Structural differences of the recombinant Factor IX molecule compared with plasma derived Factor IX appear to contribute to the different recovery compared to plasma derived Factor IX.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment and foetal development have been conducted.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
BeneFIX 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 250 IU nonacog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor IX).
After reconstitution with the accompanying 5 ml (0.234%) sodium chloride solution for injection, each ml of the solution contains approximately 50 IU nonacog alfa.
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one-stage clotting assay.
The specific activity of BeneFIX is not less than 200 IU/ mg protein.
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (INN = nonacog alfa).
Nonacog alfa is a purified protein that has 415 amino acids in a single chain.
It has a primary amino acid sequence that is comparable to the Ala148 allelic form of plasma-derived factor IX, and some post-translational modifications of the recombinant molecule are different from those of the plasma-derived molecule.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a glycoprotein that is secreted by genetically engineered mammalian cells derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.
Excipients:
Each vial contains 40 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient's clinical condition.
Dosing of BeneFIX may differ from that of plasma-derived factor IX products.
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity level has been achieved, precise monitoring using the factor IX activity assay is advised and doses should be calculated taking the factor IX activity, pharmacokinetic
35 parameters such as half-life and recovery, as well as the clinical situation into consideration in order to adjust the dose as appropriate.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Factor IX products rarely require to be administered more than once daily.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products.
Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an international standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of normal human plasma.
Estimation of the required dose of BeneFIX can be based on the finding that one unit of factor IX activity per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX, an average of 0.8 IU/ dl (range from 0.4 to 1.4 IU/ dl) in adult patients (≥ 15 years).
Pharmacokinetics have to be assessed regularly in each patient and posology has to be adjusted accordingly.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
reciprocal of observed recovery
For a recovery 0.8 IU/ dl (average increase of factor IX), then:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
1.3 IU/ kg
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given plasma activity levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor IX level required (%) or (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of Therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 24 hours for 3- 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved.

Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours
(pre- and
until adequate wound healing, then

therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor IX activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl)
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor IX, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, BeneFIX may be administered.
In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/ kg (range 13 to 78 IU/ kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days.
In younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Paediatric patients
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
In clinical studies, 57% of the paediatric patients increased their doses due to lower than expected recovery or to obtain sufficient therapeutic response or both, some to an average dose of > 50 IU/ kg.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity should be performed, as well as calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters such as recovery and half-life, as clinically indicated, in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If doses > 100 IU/ kg have been repeatedly needed during routine prophylaxis or treatment, a switch to another FIX product should be considered.
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
If the expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, biological testing should be performed to determine if a factor IX inhibitor is present.
In patients with high levels of inhibitor factor IX therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options must be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
See also section 4.4.
Method of administration
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous infusion after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for solution for injection with sterile 0.234% sodium chloride solution (see section 6.6).
BeneFIX should be administered at a slow infusion rate.
In most of the cases, an infusion rate of up to 4 ml per minute has been used.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
37 4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Known allergic reaction to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients (PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, patients treated with BeneFIX should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors that should be titrated in Bethesda Units using appropriate biological testing.
Sufficient data have not been obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
Additional safety and efficacy studies in paediatric patients are ongoing in previously treated, minimally treated, and previously untreated paediatric patients.
Clinical studies of BeneFIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
As with any patient receiving BeneFIX, dose selection for an elderly patient should be individualised.
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
Patients should be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX has to be discontinued immediately and an appropriate treatment has to be initiated.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
In the case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock should be observed.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions.
Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product.
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.
Posology has to be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetics of each patient.
Although BeneFIX contains only factor IX, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be recognised.
Since the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications, the use of factor IX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in patients with
38 disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to neonates, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC.
In each of these situations, the benefit of treatment with BeneFIX should be weighed against the risk of these complications.
There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction.
The safety and efficacy of using BeneFIX for immune tolerance induction has not been established.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that, whenever possible, every time that BeneFIX is administered to them, the name and batch number of the product is registered.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available.
Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
To date, no adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX occurred with a frequency of ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 (common).
The frequency of adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX would be categorized as uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100) or rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
Of these the most significant include: anaphylaxis, cellulitis, phlebitis, and neutralising antibodies.
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials and postmarketing experience are presented below by system organ class and frequency of occurrence.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per- infusion basis and are described using the following categories: uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
Nervous system disorders
Uncommon:
Dizziness, headache, altered taste, lightheadedness
39
Gastrointestinal disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Nausea Vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions
Uncommon:
Cellulitis, phlebitis, injection site reaction (including burning infusion site and injection site stinging), injection site discomfort
Rare:
Pyrexia
Immune system disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Neutralising antibodies (factor IX inhibition)* Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions; such reactions may include anaphylaxis*, bronchospasm/ respiratory distress, hypotension, angioedema, tachycardia, chest tightness, generalised urticarial, hives, rash, burning sensation in jaw and skull, chills (rigors), tingling, flushing, lethargy, restlessness, dry cough/ sneezing
* See additional
information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also section 4.4).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX should be discontinued at once.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also section 4.4).
Due to the production process BeneFIX contains trace amounts of hamster cell proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients (including 9 patients participating only in the surgery study) who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no anamnestic rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in PUPs.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
Renal
In a clinical trial, twelve days after a dose of BeneFIX for a bleeding episode, one hepatitis C antibody positive patient developed a renal infarct.
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
The patient continued to be treated with BeneFIX.
40 4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagic Blood Coagulation Factor IX; ATC code:
B02BD09
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (nonacog alfa).
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 55,000 Daltons that is a member of the serine protease family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic which has structural and functional characteristics comparable to endogenous factor IX.
Factor IX is activated by factor VII/ tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway as well as factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X.
This results ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Factor IX activity is absent or greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia B and substitution therapy may be required.
Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
The medicinal product has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”
This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Infusion of BeneFIX into 56 PTP patients (baseline data) with haemophilia B has shown an in vivo recovery ranging from 15 to 62% (mean 33.7 +/ - 10.3%).
One International Unit of BeneFIX showed a mean 0.75 IU/ dl (range 0.3 to 1.4 IU/ dl) increase in the circulating level of factor IX.
The biologic half- life ranged from 11 to 36 hours (mean of 19.3 +/ - 5.0 hours).
For a subset of the 56 patients, data are available from baseline to 24 months.
The pharmacokinetic data for these patients at various time points are shown in the following table:

AUC0 - ∞ = Area Under the Curve MRT = Mean Residence Time SD = Standard Deviation CI = Confidence Interval
A 28% lower recovery of recombinant Factor IX in comparison to plasma derived Factor IX was shown.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of recombinant Factor IX have also been determined after single and multiple intravenous doses in different species.
The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in studies comparing recombinant Factor IX to plasma derived Factor IX were similar to those obtained in human studies.
42 Structural differences of the recombinant Factor IX molecule compared with plasma derived Factor IX appear to contribute to the different recovery compared to plasma derived Factor IX.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment and foetal development have been conducted.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
BeneFIX 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 500 IU nonacog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor IX).
After reconstitution with the accompanying 5 ml (0.234%) sodium chloride solution for injection, each ml of the solution contains approximately 100 IU nonacog alfa
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one-stage clotting assay.
The specific activity of BeneFIX is not less than 200 IU/ mg protein.
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (INN = nonacog alfa).
Nonacog alfa is a purified protein that has 415 amino acids in a single chain.
It has a primary amino acid sequence that is comparable to the Ala148 allelic form of plasma-derived factor IX, and some post-translational modifications of the recombinant molecule are different from those of the plasma-derived molecule.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a glycoprotein that is secreted by genetically engineered mammalian cells derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.
Excipients:
Each vial contains 40 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
White/ almost white powder and clear and colourless solvent for solution for injection.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient's clinical condition.
Dosing of BeneFIX may differ from that of plasma-derived factor IX products.
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity level has been achieved, precise monitoring using the factor IX activity assay is advised and doses should be calculated taking the factor IX activity, pharmacokinetic
45 parameters such as half-life and recovery, as well as the clinical situation into consideration in order to adjust the dose as appropriate.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Factor IX products rarely require to be administered more than once daily.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products.
Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an international standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of normal human plasma.
Estimation of the required dose of BeneFIX can be based on the finding that one unit of factor IX activity per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX, an average of 0.8 IU/ dl (range from 0.4 to 1.4 IU/ dl) in adult patients (≥ 15 years).
Pharmacokinetics have to be assessed regularly in each patient and posology has to be adjusted accordingly.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
reciprocal of observed recovery
For a recovery 0.8 IU/ dl (average increase of factor IX), then:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
1.3 IU/ kg
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given plasma activity levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor IX level required (%) or (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of Therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 24 hours for 3- 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved.
46 Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Surgery

Major
80-100
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours
(pre- and
until adequate wound healing, then
postoperative)
therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor IX activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl)
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor IX, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, BeneFIX may be administered.
In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/ kg (range 13 to 78 IU/ kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days.
In younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Paediatric patients
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
In clinical studies, 57% of the paediatric patients increased their doses due to lower than expected recovery or to obtain sufficient therapeutic response or both, some to an average dose of > 50 IU/ kg.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity should be performed, as well as calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters such as recovery and half-life, as clinically indicated, in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If doses > 100 IU/ kg have been repeatedly needed during routine prophylaxis or treatment, a switch to another FIX product should be considered.
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
If the expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, biological testing should be performed to determine if a factor IX inhibitor is present.
In patients with high levels of inhibitor factor IX therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options must be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
See also section 4.4.
Method of administration
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous infusion after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for solution for injection with sterile 0.234% sodium chloride solution (see section 6.6).
BeneFIX should be administered at a slow infusion rate.
In most of the cases, an infusion rate of up to 4 ml per minute has been used.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
47 4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Known allergic reaction to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients (PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, patients treated with BeneFIX should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors that should be titrated in Bethesda Units using appropriate biological testing.
Sufficient data have not been obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
Additional safety and efficacy studies in paediatric patients are ongoing in previously treated, minimally treated, and previously untreated paediatric patients.
Clinical studies of BeneFIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
As with any patient receiving BeneFIX, dose selection for an elderly patient should be individualised.
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
Patients should be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX has to be discontinued immediately and an appropriate treatment has to be initiated.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
In the case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock should be observed.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions.
Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product.
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.
Posology has to be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetics of each patient.
Although BeneFIX contains only factor IX, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be recognised.
Since the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications, the use of factor IX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in patients with
48 disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to neonates, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC.
In each of these situations, the benefit of treatment with BeneFIX should be weighed against the risk of these complications.
There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction.
The safety and efficacy of using BeneFIX for immune tolerance induction has not been established.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that, whenever possible, every time that BeneFIX is administered to them, the name and batch number of the product is registered.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available.
Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
To date, no adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX occurred with a frequency of ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 (common).
The frequency of adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX would be categorized as uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100) or rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
Of these the most significant include: anaphylaxis, cellulitis, phlebitis, and neutralising antibodies.
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials and postmarketing experience are presented below by system organ class and frequency of occurrence.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per- infusion basis and are described using the following categories: uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
49 Nervous system disorders

* See additional
information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also section 4.4).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX should be discontinued at once.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also section 4.4).
Due to the production process BeneFIX contains trace amounts of hamster cell proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients (including 9 patients participating only in the surgery study) who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no anamnestic rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in PUPs.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
50 Renal
In a clinical trial, twelve days after a dose of BeneFIX for a bleeding episode, one hepatitis C antibody positive patient developed a renal infarct.
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagic Blood Coagulation Factor IX; ATC code:
B02BD09
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (nonacog alfa).
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 55,000 Daltons that is a member of the serine protease family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic which has structural and functional characteristics comparable to endogenous factor IX.
Factor IX is activated by factor VII/ tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway as well as factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X.
This results ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Factor IX activity is absent or greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia B and substitution therapy may be required.
Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
The medicinal product has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”
This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Infusion of BeneFIX into 56 PTP patients (baseline data) with haemophilia B has shown an in vivo recovery ranging from 15 to 62% (mean 33.7 +/ - 10.3%).
One International Unit of BeneFIX showed a mean 0.75 IU/ dl (range 0.3 to 1.4 IU/ dl) increase in the circulating level of factor IX.
The biologic half- life ranged from 11 to 36 hours (mean of 19.3 +/ - 5.0 hours).
For a subset of the 56 patients, data are available from baseline to 24 months.
The pharmacokinetic data for these patients at various time points are shown in the following table:

A 28% lower recovery of recombinant Factor IX in comparison to plasma derived Factor IX was shown.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of recombinant Factor IX have also been determined after single and multiple intravenous doses in different species.
The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in studies comparing
52 recombinant Factor IX to plasma derived Factor IX were similar to those obtained in human studies.
Structural differences of the recombinant Factor IX molecule compared with plasma derived Factor IX appear to contribute to the different recovery compared to plasma derived Factor IX.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment and foetal development have been conducted.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
BeneFIX 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 1000 IU nonacog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor IX).
After reconstitution with the accompanying 5 ml (0.234%) sodium chloride solution for injection, each ml of the solution contains approximately 200 IU nonacog alfa
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one-stage clotting assay.
The specific activity of BeneFIX is not less than 200 IU/ mg protein.
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (INN = nonacog alfa).
Nonacog alfa is a purified protein that has 415 amino acids in a single chain.
It has a primary amino acid sequence that is comparable to the Ala148 allelic form of plasma-derived factor IX, and some post-translational modifications of the recombinant molecule are different from those of the plasma-derived molecule.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a glycoprotein that is secreted by genetically engineered mammalian cells derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.
Excipients:
Each vial contains 40 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
White/ almost white powder and clear and colourless solvent for solution for injection.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient's clinical condition.
Dosing of BeneFIX may differ from that of plasma-derived factor IX products.
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity level has been achieved, precise monitoring using the factor IX activity assay is advised and doses should be calculated taking the factor IX activity, pharmacokinetic
55 parameters such as half-life and recovery, as well as the clinical situation into consideration in order to adjust the dose as appropriate.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Factor IX products rarely require to be administered more than once daily.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products.
Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an international standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of normal human plasma.
Estimation of the required dose of BeneFIX can be based on the finding that one unit of factor IX activity per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX, an average of 0.8 IU/ dl (range from 0.4 to 1.4 IU/ dl) in adult patients (≥ 15 years).
Pharmacokinetics have to be assessed regularly in each patient and posology has to be adjusted accordingly.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
reciprocal of observed recovery
For a recovery 0.8 IU/ dl (average increase of factor IX), then:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
1.3 IU/ kg
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given plasma activity levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor IX level required (%) or (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of Therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 24 hours for 3- 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved.
56 Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Surgery

Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80-100
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours
(pre- and
until adequate wound healing, then
postoperative)
therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor IX activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl)
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor IX, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, BeneFIX may be administered.
In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/ kg (range 13 to 78 IU/ kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days.
In younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Paediatric patients
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
In clinical studies, 57% of the paediatric patients increased their doses due to lower than expected recovery or to obtain sufficient therapeutic response or both, some to an average dose of > 50 IU/ kg.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity should be performed, as well as calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters such as recovery and half-life, as clinically indicated, in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If doses > 100 IU/ kg have been repeatedly needed during routine prophylaxis or treatment, a switch to another FIX product should be considered.
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
If the expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, biological testing should be performed to determine if a factor IX inhibitor is present.
In patients with high levels of inhibitor factor IX therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options must be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
See also section 4.4.
Method of administration
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous infusion after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for solution for injection with sterile 0.234% sodium chloride solution (see section 6.6).
BeneFIX should be administered at a slow infusion rate.
In most of the cases, an infusion rate of up to 4 ml per minute has been used.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
57 4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Known allergic reaction to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients (PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, patients treated with BeneFIX should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors that should be titrated in Bethesda Units using appropriate biological testing.
Sufficient data have not been obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
Additional safety and efficacy studies in paediatric patients are ongoing in previously treated, minimally treated, and previously untreated paediatric patients.
Clinical studies of BeneFIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
As with any patient receiving BeneFIX, dose selection for an elderly patient should be individualised.
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
Patients should be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX has to be discontinued immediately and an appropriate treatment has to be initiated.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
In the case of shock, the current medical standards for shock-treatment should be observed.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions.
Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product.
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.
Posology has to be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetics of each patient.
Although BeneFIX contains only factor IX, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be recognised.
Since the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications, the use of factor IX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in patients with
58 disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to neonates, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC.
In each of these situations, the benefit of treatment with BeneFIX should be weighed against the risk of these complications.
There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction.
The safety and efficacy of using BeneFIX for immune tolerance induction has not been established.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that, whenever possible, every time that BeneFIX is administered to them, the name and batch number of the product is registered.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available.
Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
To date, no adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX occurred with a frequency of ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 (common).
The frequency of adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX would be categorized as uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100) or rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
Of these the most significant include: anaphylaxis, cellulitis, phlebitis, and neutralising antibodies.
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials and postmarketing experience are presented below by system organ class and frequency of occurrence.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per- infusion basis and are described using the following categories: uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
59 Nervous system disorders
Uncommon:
Dizziness, headache, altered taste, lightheadedness
Gastrointestinal disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Nausea Vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions
Uncommon:
Cellulitis, phlebitis, injection site reaction (including burning infusion site and injection site stinging), injection site discomfort
Rare:
Pyrexia
Immune system disorders
Uncommon:

Neutralising antibodies (factor IX inhibition)* Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions; such reactions may include anaphylaxis*, bronchospasm/ respiratory distress, hypotension, angioedema, tachycardia, chest tightness, generalised urticarial, hives, rash, burning sensation in jaw and skull, chills (rigors), tingling, flushing, lethargy, restlessness, dry cough/ sneezing
* See additional
information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also section 4.4).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX should be discontinued at once.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also section 4.4).
Due to the production process BeneFIX contains trace amounts of hamster cell proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients (including 9 patients participating only in the surgery study) who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no anamnestic rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in PUPs.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
60 Renal
In a clinical trial, twelve days after a dose of BeneFIX for a bleeding episode, one hepatitis C antibody positive patient developed a renal infarct.
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
The patient continued to be treated with BeneFIX.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

A 28% lower recovery of recombinant BeneFIX in comparison to plasma derived Factor IX was shown.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of recombinant Factor IX have also been determined after single and multiple
62 intravenous doses in different species.
The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in studies comparing recombinant Factor IX to plasma derived Factor IX were similar to those obtained in human studies.
Structural differences of the recombinant Factor IX molecule compared with plasma derived Factor IX appear to contribute to the different recovery compared to plasma derived Factor IX.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment and foetal development have been conducted.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
BeneFIX 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 2000 IU nonacog alfa (recombinant coagulation factor IX).
After reconstitution with the accompanying 5 ml (0.234%) sodium chloride solution for injection, each ml of the solution contains approximately 400 IU nonacog alfa.
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one-stage clotting assay.
The specific activity of BeneFIX is not less than 200 IU/ mg protein.
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (INN = nonacog alfa).
Nonacog alfa is a purified protein that has 415 amino acids in a single chain.
It has a primary amino acid sequence that is comparable to the Ala148 allelic form of plasma-derived factor IX, and some post-translational modifications of the recombinant molecule are different from those of the plasma-derived molecule.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a glycoprotein that is secreted by genetically engineered mammalian cells derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line.
Excipients:
Each vial contains 40 mg sucrose.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL form
White/ almost white powder and clear and colourless solvent for solution for injection.
4.
Clinical particulars
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia.
Posology
The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding, and the patient's clinical condition.
Dosing of BeneFIX may differ from that of plasma-derived factor IX products.
To ensure that the desired factor IX activity level has been achieved, precise monitoring using the factor IX activity assay is advised and doses should be calculated taking the factor IX activity, pharmacokinetic
66 parameters such as half-life and recovery, as well as the clinical situation into consideration in order to adjust the dose as appropriate.
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical effectiveness in the individual case.
Factor IX products rarely require to be administered more than once daily.
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products.
Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an international standard for factor IX in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor IX activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in one ml of normal human plasma.
Estimation of the required dose of BeneFIX can be based on the finding that one unit of factor IX activity per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX, an average of 0.8 IU/ dl (range from 0.4 to 1.4 IU/ dl) in adult patients (≥ 15 years).
Pharmacokinetics have to be assessed regularly in each patient and posology has to be adjusted accordingly.
The required dosage is determined using the following formula:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
reciprocal of observed recovery
For a recovery 0.8 IU/ dl (average increase of factor IX), then:
Number of factor IX IU required
=
body weight (in kg)
X
desired factor IX X increase (%) or (IU/ dl)
1.3 IU/ kg
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given plasma activity levels (in% of normal or in IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.
The following table can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:
Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor IX level required (%) or (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of Therapy (days)
Early haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or oral bleeding
20-40
Repeat every 24 hours.
At least 1 day, until the bleeding episode as indicated by pain is resolved or healing is achieved.
More extensive haemarthrosis, muscle bleeding or haematoma
30-60
Repeat infusion every 24 hours for 3- 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.
Life-threatening haemorrhages
60-100
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours until threat is resolved.
67 Degree of haemorrhage/ Type of surgical procedure Surgery
Factor IX level required (%) or (IU/ dl)
Frequency of doses (hours)/ Duration of Therapy (days)
Minor:
Including tooth extraction
30-60
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Major
80-100
Repeat infusion every 8-24 hours
(pre- and
until adequate wound healing, then
postoperative)
therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor IX activity of 30% to 60% (IU/ dl)
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions.
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is indispensable.
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor IX, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia B, BeneFIX may be administered.
In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/ kg (range 13 to 78 IU/ kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days.
In younger patients, shorter dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary.
Paediatric patients
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
In clinical studies, 57% of the paediatric patients increased their doses due to lower than expected recovery or to obtain sufficient therapeutic response or both, some to an average dose of > 50 IU/ kg.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity should be performed, as well as calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters such as recovery and half-life, as clinically indicated, in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If doses > 100 IU/ kg have been repeatedly needed during routine prophylaxis or treatment, a switch to another FIX product should be considered.
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
If the expected factor IX activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, biological testing should be performed to determine if a factor IX inhibitor is present.
In patients with high levels of inhibitor factor IX therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options must be considered.
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia.
See also section 4.4.
Method of administration
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous infusion after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for solution for injection with sterile 0.234% sodium chloride solution (see section 6.6).
BeneFIX should be administered at a slow infusion rate.
In most of the cases, an infusion rate of up to 4 ml per minute has been used.
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’ s comfort level.
68 4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Known allergic reaction to hamster proteins.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients (PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, patients treated with BeneFIX should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors that should be titrated in Bethesda Units using appropriate biological testing.
Sufficient data have not been obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
Additional safety and efficacy studies in paediatric patients are ongoing in previously treated, minimally treated, and previously untreated paediatric patients.
Clinical studies of BeneFIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
As with any patient receiving BeneFIX, dose selection for an elderly patient should be individualised.
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The product contains traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic/ anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
Patients should be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.
If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX has to be discontinued immediately and an appropriate treatment has to be initiated.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
In the case of shock, the current medical standards for treatment of shock should be observed.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions.
Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product.
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.
Posology has to be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetics of each patient.
Although BeneFIX contains only factor IX, the risk of thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be recognised.
Since the use of factor IX complex concentrates has historically been associated with the development of thromboembolic complications, the use of factor IX-containing products may be potentially hazardous in patients with signs of fibrinolysis and in patients with
69 disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to neonates, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC.
In each of these situations, the benefit of treatment with BeneFIX should be weighed against the risk of these complications.
There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in haemophilia B patients with Factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction.
The safety and efficacy of using BeneFIX for immune tolerance induction has not been established.
In the interest of patients, it is recommended that, whenever possible, every time that BeneFIX is administered to them, the name and batch number of the product is registered.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX.
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available.
Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
To date, no adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX occurred with a frequency of ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 (common).
The frequency of adverse reactions reported in association with BeneFIX would be categorized as uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100) or rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
Of these the most significant include: anaphylaxis, cellulitis, phlebitis, and neutralising antibodies.
Adverse reactions based on experience from clinical trials and postmarketing experience are presented below by system organ class and frequency of occurrence.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
These frequencies have been estimated on a per- infusion basis and are described using the following categories: uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 to ≤ 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to ≤ 1/ 1000).
70 Nervous system disorders
Uncommon:
Dizziness, headache, altered taste, lightheadedness
Gastrointestinal disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Nausea Vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions
Uncommon:
Cellulitis, phlebitis, injection site reaction (including burning infusion site and injection site stinging), injection site discomfort

Neutralising antibodies (factor IX inhibition)* Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions; such reactions may include anaphylaxis*, bronchospasm/ respiratory distress, hypotension, angioedema, tachycardia, chest tightness, generalised urticarial, hives, rash, burning sensation in jaw and skull, chills (rigors), tingling, flushing, lethargy, restlessness, dry cough/ sneezing
* See additional
information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also section 4.4).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of BeneFIX should be discontinued at once.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative haemostatic measures should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also section 4.4).
Due to the production process BeneFIX contains trace amounts of hamster cell proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients (including 9 patients participating only in the surgery study) who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no anamnestic rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in PUPs.
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
71 Renal
In a clinical trial, twelve days after a dose of BeneFIX for a bleeding episode, one hepatitis C antibody positive patient developed a renal infarct.
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
The patient continued to be treated with BeneFIX.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagic Blood Coagulation Factor IX; ATC code:
B02BD09
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (nonacog alfa).
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with an approximate molecular mass of 55,000 Daltons that is a member of the serine protease family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors.
Recombinant coagulation factor IX is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic which has structural and functional characteristics comparable to endogenous factor IX.
Factor IX is activated by factor VII/ tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway as well as factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X.
This results ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.
Factor IX activity is absent or greatly reduced in patients with haemophilia B and substitution therapy may be required.
Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma.
By replacement therapy the plasma levels of factor IX is increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.
There are insufficient data to recommend the use of BeneFIX in children less than 6 years of age.
The medicinal product has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”
This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Infusion of BeneFIX into 56 PTP patients (baseline data) with haemophilia B has shown an in vivo recovery ranging from 15 to 62% (mean 33.7 +/ - 10.3%).
One International Unit of BeneFIX showed a mean 0.75 IU/ dl (range 0.3 to 1.4 IU/ dl) increase in the circulating level of factor IX.
The biologic half- life ranged from 11 to 36 hours (mean of 19.3 +/ - 5.0 hours).
For a subset of the 56 patients, data are available from baseline to 24 months.
The pharmacokinetic data for these patients at various time points are shown in the following table:

Data exclude those collected from one patient after evidence of inhibitor development was observed at 9 months.
AUC0 - ∞ = Area Under the Curve MRT = Mean Residence Time SD = Standard Deviation CI = Confidence Interval
A 28% lower recovery of recombinant Factor IX in comparison to plasma derived Factor IX was shown.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of recombinant Factor IX have also been determined after single and multiple
73 intravenous doses in different species.
The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in studies comparing recombinant Factor IX to plasma derived Factor IX were similar to those obtained in human studies.
Structural differences of the recombinant Factor IX molecule compared with plasma derived Factor IX appear to contribute to the different recovery compared to plasma derived Factor IX.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity.
No investigations on carcinogenicity, fertility impairment and foetal development have been conducted.

PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS
6.1 List of excipients
Powder Sucrose Glycine L-Histidine Polysorbate 80
Solvent Sodium chloride solution
6.2 Incompatibilities
In the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products.
Only the provided infusion set should be used.
Treatment failure can occur as a consequence of human coagulation factor IX adsorption to the internal surfaces of some infusion equipment.
6.3 Shelf life
3 years
The reconstituted product should be used immediately, but no longer than 3 hours after reconstitution.
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 3 hours at temperatures up to 25oC.
6.4 Special precautions for storage
Store and transport refrigerated (2°C - 8°C).
Do not freeze, in order to prevent damage to the prefilled syringe.
For the purpose of ambulatory use the product may be removed from refrigerated storage for one single period of maximum 1 month at room temperature (up to 25 ºC).
At the end of this period, the product should not be put back in the refrigerator, but should be used or discarded.
74 6.5 Nature and contents of container
2000 IU of powder in a 10 ml vial (type 1 glass) with a stopper (chlorobutyl) and a flip-off seal (aluminium) and 5 ml of solvent in a prefilled syringe (type 1 glass) with a plunger stopper (bromobutyl), a tip-cap (bromobutyl) and a sterile vial adapter reconstitution device, a sterile infusion set, two alcohol swabs, a plaster, and a gauze pad.
6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous (IV) injection after reconstitution of the lyophilised powder for injection with the supplied solvent (0.234% w/ v sodium chloride solution) in the pre-filled syringe.
BeneFIX, when reconstituted, contains polysorbate-80, which is known to increase the rate of di-(2- ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) extraction from polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
This should be considered during the preparation and administration of BeneFIX.
It is important that the recommendations in section 4.2 be followed closely.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
The reconstituted solution should be used immediately or within 3 hours.
Because the use of BeneFIX by continuous infusion has not been evaluated, BeneFIX should not be mixed with infusion solutions or be given in a drip.

Further information
1.
WHAT BENEFIX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
BeneFIX is a coagulation factor IX product that is produced by recombinant technology.
Patients with haemophilia B (Christmas disease) are deficient in coagulation factor IX.
BeneFIX works by replacing factor IX in haemophilia B patients to enable their blood to clot.
BeneFIX is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding (prophylaxis) in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE BENEFIX
Do not take BeneFIX
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to nonacog alfa or any of the other ingredients of BeneFIX.
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to hamster proteins.
Take special care with BeneFIX
- See your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected.
- Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients
(PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor, and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, while being treated with BeneFIX you should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
Sufficient data have not been obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
120
- Clinical studies on BeneFIX did not determine whether patients aged 65 and over respond
differently from younger subjects.
As for any patient receiving BeneFIX, if you are elderly your doctor will choose a specific dose appropriate for you.
- As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The
product may contain traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
You will be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure and anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing and/ or breathing, red or swollen face and/ or hands).
- If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact a doctor
or seek emergency medical care immediately.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative therapy should be considered.
- There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX
inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, if you experience allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, or hypotension, you should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitor may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
- The production of factor IX in the body is controlled by the factor IX gene.
Patients who have major
deletion mutations of their factor IX gene may be more likely to have factor IX inhibitor and an allergic reaction.
Therefore if you are known to have a major deletion mutation of the factor IX gene, your doctor will monitor you more closely for signs of an allergic reaction particularly when you first start to take BeneFIX.
- Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, your initial administrations of
factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions can be provided.
- Even in the absence of factor IX inhibitor, higher doses of BeneFIX may be needed than required
for plasma-derived factor IX.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity and pharmacokinetic assessment have to be performed in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose, contact your doctor.
- If you suffer from a liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had surgery, there is an increased
risk for coagulation complications.
- There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the
administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
- A kidney disorder (nephrotic syndrome) has been reported following high doses of plasma derived
Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
- It is recommended that, whenever possible, every time you use BeneFIX, the name and batch
number of the product is recorded.
121 Taking other medicines:
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding you should only take BeneFIX upon specific instructions from your physician.
It is not known whether BeneFIX can affect reproductive capacity or cause foetal harm when given to pregnant women.
Your doctor may advise you to stop treatment with BeneFIX if you are breast- feeding or become pregnant.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines:
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
3.
HOW TO TAKE BENEFIX
Always take BeneFIX exactly as your doctor has instructed you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Your doctor will decide the dose of BeneFIX you will receive.
This dose and duration will depend upon your individual needs for replacement factor IX therapy and upon pharmacokinetics (recovery and half- life) that have to be checked regularly.
You may notice a difference in the dose you receive if you are changing from a plasma-derived factor IX product to BeneFIX.
Your doctor may decide to change the dose of BeneFIX you receive during your treatment.
Reconstitution and administration
The procedures below are provided as guidelines for the reconstitution and administration of BeneFIX.
Patients should follow the specific venipuncture procedures provided by their physicians.
Always wash your hands prior to performing the following procedures.
Aseptic technique (meaning clean and germ free) should be used during the reconstitution procedure.
Reconstitution:
BeneFIX will be administered by intravenous infusion (IV) after reconstitution with sterile water for injections (solvent).
1.
Allow the lyophilised vial of BeneFIX and solvent to reach room temperature.
2.
Remove the caps from the BeneFIX concentrate and solvent vials, to expose the central portion of the rubber stoppers.
3.
Wipe the tops of both vials with an alcohol swab provided, or use another antiseptic solution and allow to dry.
122 4.
Remove the transparent protective cover from the short end of the sterile double-ended needle, and insert that end of the needle into the solvent vial at the centre of the stopper.
Note: solvent vial should be positioned on a flat level surface such as a table and needle inserted vertically, i. e. perpendicular to the stopper surface.
5.
Remove the coloured protective cover from the long end of the sterile double ended needle.
Invert the solvent vial and, to minimise leakage, quickly insert the long end of the needle through the centre of the stopper of the upright BeneFIX vial.
Note:
BeneFIX vial should be positioned on a flat level surface such as a table and long end of the needle inserted vertically, i. e. perpendicular to the stopper surface.
See Fig.1.
6.
The vacuum will draw the solvent into the BeneFIX vial.
Note:
While the solvent is being drawn into the BeneFIX vial, point the double-ended needle toward the wall of the BeneFIX vial to prevent excess foaming.
7.
Once the transfer is complete, remove the long end of the needle from the BeneFIX vial, and properly discard the needle with the empty solvent vial.
Note:
If the solvent does not completely transfer into the BeneFIX vial, DO NOT USE the contents of the vial.
Note that it is acceptable for a small amount of fluid to remain in the solvent vial after transfer.
8.
Gently rotate the vial to dissolve the powder.
See Fig.
2.
9.
The final solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter before administration.
The solution should appear clear and colourless.
BeneFIX should be administered immediately or within 3 hours after reconstitution.
The reconstituted solution may be stored at room temperature prior to administration.
Administration (Intravenous Injection):
BeneFIX should be administered using a single sterile plastic disposable syringe.
In addition, the solution should be withdrawn from the vial using the filter spike.
1.
Using aseptic technique, attach the filter spike to the sterile disposable syringe.
Note:
DO NOT push air into the BeneFIX vial.
This may cause partial loss of product.
2.
Insert the filter spike end into the stopper of the BeneFIX vial.
See Fig.3.
3.
Invert the vial and withdraw the reconstituted solution into the syringe.
See Fig.4.
4.
Remove and discard the filter spike.
Note:
If you are to receive more than one vial of BeneFIX the contents of multiple vials may be drawn into the same syringe through a separate, unused filter spike.
5.
Attach the syringe to the adaptor (Luer) end of the infusion set.
6.
Transfer BeneFIX solution into the tubing by depressing the syringe plunger until the tubing is filled completely.
123 7.
During venipuncture, it is important to adhere to the instructions to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood must not enter the syringe.
8.
Perform venipuncture as instructed by your physician.
To ensure that the needle is in the vein, check for blood return by pulling back very slightly on the plunger of the syringe.
9.
Stop pulling back the plunger when blood enters the tubing and inject BeneFIX intravenously over several minutes.
In most of the cases an infusion rate with a maximum of up to 4 ml per minute was well tolerated BeneFIX should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
Your doctor may change your recommended infusion rate to make the infusion more comfortable.
Because the use of BeneFIX by continuous infusion has not been evaluated, BeneFIX should not be mixed with infusion solutions or be given in a drip.
Please dispose of all unused solution, empty vials and used needles and syringes in an appropriate container for throwing away waste as it may hurt others if not handled properly.
If you take more BeneFIX than you should:
Please contact your doctor immediately if you inject more BeneFIX than your doctor recommends.
If you stop taking BeneFIX
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, BeneFIX can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Should you experience a significant increase in your usage of BeneFIX in order to control a bleed, please contact your doctor immediately; your blood should be checked for inhibitors to factor IX activity.
Possible side effects are listed according to the following categories:
Uncommon:
Rare:
between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 patients between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 patients
Immune system disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors)* Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions; such reactions may include burning sensation in jaw and skull, chills (rigors), dry cough/ sneeze, flushing, lethargy, restlessness, tingling, hives, itching and rash, low blood pressure, fast heart rate, tightness of the chest, wheezing, swelling of the throat, anaphylaxis*, rash
124 Nervous system disorders
Uncommon:
Dizziness, headache, altered taste, lightheadedness
Gastrointestinal
disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Nausea Vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions
Uncommon:
Rare:
Fever
Injection site reactions (including burning and stinging at the infusion site), discomfort at the IV site, cellulitis, phlebitis
* See additional
information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact your doctor or seek emergency medical care immediately.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative therapy should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
Patients treated with BeneFIX should be monitored for inhibitor development.
There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in previously untreated patients (PUPs).
Due to the production process BeneFIX may contain trace amounts of hamster proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
A kidney disorder has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
125 Renal
One patient developed severe abdominal pain which was caused by an area of the kidney that lacked the necessary blood supply (referred to as a renal infarct).
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
If any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side effect not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
5.

- As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The
product may contain traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
You will be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure and anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing and/ or breathing, red or swollen face and/ or hands).
- If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact a doctor
or seek emergency medical care immediately.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative therapy should be considered.
- There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor
IX inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, if you experience allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, or hypotension, you should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitor may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
- The production of factor IX in the body is controlled by the factor IX gene.
Patients who have
major deletion mutations of their factor IX gene may be more likely to have factor IX inhibitor and an allergic reaction.
Therefore if you are known to have a major deletion mutation of the factor IX gene, your doctor will monitor you more closely for signs of an allergic reaction particularly when you first start to take BeneFIX.
- Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, your initial administrations of
factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions can be provided.
- Even in the absence of factor IX inhibitor, higher doses of BeneFIX may be needed than required
for plasma-derived factor IX.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity and pharmacokinetic assessment have to be performed in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose, contact your doctor.
- If you suffer from a liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had surgery, there is an
increased risk for coagulation complications.
- There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the
administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
- A kidney disorder (nephrotic syndrome) has been reported following high doses of plasma derived
Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
- It is recommended that, whenever possible, every time you use BeneFIX, the name and batch
number of the product is recorded.
132 Taking other medicines:
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding you should only take BeneFIX upon specific instructions from your physician.
It is not known whether BeneFIX can affect reproductive capacity or cause foetal harm when given to pregnant women.
Your doctor may advise you to stop treatment with BeneFIX if you are breast- feeding or become pregnant.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines:
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
3.
HOW TO TAKE BENEFIX
Always take BeneFIX exactly as your doctor has instructed you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Your doctor will decide the dose of BeneFIX you will receive.
This dose and duration will depend upon your individual needs for replacement factor IX therapy and upon pharmacokinetics (recovery and half- life) that have to be checked regularly.
You may notice a difference in the dose you receive if you are changing from a plasma-derived factor IX product to BeneFIX.
Your doctor may decide to change the dose of BeneFIX you receive during your treatment.
Reconstitution and administration
The procedures below are provided as guidelines for the reconstitution and administration of BeneFIX.
Patients should follow the specific venipuncture procedures provided by their physicians.
Always wash your hands prior to performing the following procedures.
Aseptic technique (meaning clean and germ free) should be used during the reconstitution procedure.
Reconstitution:
BeneFIX will be administered by intravenous infusion (IV) after reconstitution with sterile water for injections (solvent).
1.
Allow the lyophilised vial of BeneFIX and solvent to reach room temperature.
2.
Remove the caps from the BeneFIX concentrate and solvent vials, to expose the central portion of the rubber stoppers.
3.
Wipe the tops of both vials with an alcohol swab provided, or use another antiseptic solution and allow to dry.
133 4.
Remove the transparent protective cover from the short end of the sterile double-ended needle, and insert that end of the needle into the solvent vial at the centre of the stopper.
Note: solvent vial should be positioned on a flat level surface such as a table and needle inserted vertically, i. e. perpendicular to the stopper surface.
5.
Remove the coloured protective cover from the long end of the sterile double ended needle.
Invert the solvent vial and, to minimise leakage, quickly insert the long end of the needle through the centre of the stopper of the upright BeneFIX vial.
Note:
BeneFIX vial should be positioned on a flat level surface such as a table and long end of the needle inserted vertically, i. e. perpendicular to the stopper surface.
See Fig.1.
6.
The vacuum will draw the solvent into the BeneFIX vial.
Note:
While the solvent is being drawn into the BeneFIX vial, point the double-ended needle toward the wall of the BeneFIX vial to prevent excess foaming.
7.
Once the transfer is complete, remove the long end of the needle from the BeneFIX vial, and properly discard the needle with the empty solvent vial.
Note:
If the solvent does not completely transfer into the BeneFIX vial, DO NOT USE the contents of the vial.
Note that it is acceptable for a small amount of fluid to remain in the solvent vial after transfer.
8.
Gently rotate the vial to dissolve the powder.
See Fig.
2.
9.
The final solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter before administration.
The solution should appear clear and colourless.
BeneFIX should be administered immediately or within 3 hours after reconstitution.
The reconstituted solution may be stored at room temperature prior to administration.
Administration (Intravenous Injection):
BeneFIX should be administered using a single sterile disposable plastic syringe.
In addition, the solution should be withdrawn from the vial using the filter spike.
1.
Using aseptic technique, attach the filter spike to the sterile disposable syringe.
Note:
DO NOT push air into the BeneFIX vial.
This may cause partial loss of product.
2.
Insert the filter spike end into the stopper of the BeneFIX vial.
See Fig.3.
3.
Invert the vial and withdraw the reconstituted solution into the syringe.
See Fig.4.
4.
Remove and discard the filter spike.
Note:
If you are to receive more than one vial of BeneFIX the contents of multiple vials may be drawn into the same syringe through a separate, unused filter spike.
5.
Attach the syringe to the adaptor (Luer) end of the infusion set.
6.
Transfer BeneFIX solution into the tubing by depressing the syringe plunger until the tubing is filled completely.
134 7.
During venipuncture, it is important to adhere to the instructions to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood must not enter the syringe.
8.
Perform venipuncture as instructed by your physician.
To ensure that the needle is in the vein, check for blood return by pulling back very slightly on the plunger of the syringe.
9.
Stop pulling back the plunger when blood enters the tubing and inject BeneFIX intravenously over several minutes.
In most of the cases an infusion rate with a maximum of up to 4 ml per minute was well tolerated BeneFIX should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
Your doctor may change your recommended infusion rate to make the infusion more comfortable.
Because the use of BeneFIX by continuous infusion has not been evaluated, BeneFIX should not be mixed with infusion solutions or be given in a drip.
Please dispose of all unused solution, empty vials and used needles and syringes in an appropriate container for throwing away waste as it may hurt others if not handled properly.
If you take more BeneFIX than you should:
Please contact your doctor immediately if you inject more BeneFIX than your doctor recommends.
If you stop taking BeneFIX
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, BeneFIX can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Should you experience a significant increase in your usage of BeneFIX in order to control a bleed, please contact your doctor immediately; your blood should be checked for inhibitors to factor IX activity.
Possible side effects are listed according to the following categories:
Uncommon:
Rare:
between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 patients between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 patients
Immune system disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors)* Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions; such reactions may include burning sensation in jaw and skull, chills (rigors), dry cough/ sneeze, flushing, lethargy, restlessness, tingling, hives, itching and rash, low blood pressure, fast heart rate, tightness of the chest, wheezing, swelling of the throat, anaphylaxis*, rash
135 Nervous system disorders
Uncommon:
Dizziness, headache, altered taste, lightheadedness
Gastrointestinal
disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Nausea Vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions
Uncommon:
Injection site reactions (including burning and stinging at the infusion site), discomfort at the IV site, cellulitis, phlebitis
Rare:
Fever
* See additional
information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact your doctor or seek emergency medical care immediately.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative therapy should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
Patients treated with BeneFIX should be monitored for inhibitor development.
There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in previously untreated patients (PUPs).
Due to the production process BeneFIX may contain trace amounts of hamster proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
A kidney disorder has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
136 Renal
One patient developed severe abdominal pain which was caused by an area of the kidney that lacked the necessary blood supply (referred to as a renal infarct).
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
If any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side effect not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
5.
HOW TO STORE BENEFIX

Further information
1.
WHAT IS BENEFIX AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
BeneFIX is a coagulation factor IX product that is produced by recombinant technology.
Patients with haemophilia B (Christmas disease) are deficient in coagulation factor IX.
BeneFIX works by replacing factor IX in haemophilia B patients to enable their blood to clot.
BeneFIX is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding (prophylaxis) in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE BENEFIX
Do not take BeneFIX
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to nonacog alfa or any of the other ingredients of BeneFIX.
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to hamster proteins.
Take special care with BeneFIX
- See your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected.
- Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients
(PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor, and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, while being treated with BeneFIX you should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
Sufficient data have not been obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
142
- Clinical studies on BeneFIX did not determine whether patients aged 65 and over respond
differently from younger subjects.
As for any patient receiving BeneFIX, if you are elderly your doctor will choose a specific dose appropriate for you.
- As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The
product may contain traces of hamster proteins.

Due to the production process BeneFIX may contain trace amounts of hamster proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
A kidney disorder has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
147 Renal
One patient developed severe abdominal pain which was caused by an area of the kidney that lacked the necessary blood supply (referred to as a renal infarct).
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
If any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side effect not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

Further information
1.
WHAT IS BENEFIX AND WHAT IS IT USED FOR
BeneFIX is a coagulation factor IX product that is produced by recombinant technology.
Patients with haemophilia B (Christmas disease) are deficient in coagulation factor IX.
BeneFIX works by replacing factor IX in haemophilia B patients to enable their blood to clot.
BeneFIX is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding (prophylaxis) in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE BENEFIX
Do not take BeneFIX:
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to nonacog alfa or any of the other ingredients of BeneFIX.
- If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to hamster proteins.
Take special care with BeneFIX
- See your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected.
- Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) are an uncommon event in previously treated patients
(PTPs) receiving factor IX-containing products.
Since during clinical studies one PTP treated with BeneFIX developed a clinically relevant low responding inhibitor, and experience on antigenicity with recombinant factor IX is still limited, while being treated with BeneFIX you should be carefully monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.
Sufficient data have not been
153 obtained from ongoing clinical studies on the treatment of previously untreated patients (PUPs), with BeneFIX.
-
- - Clinical studies on BeneFIX did not determine whether patients aged 65 and over respond
differently from younger subjects.
As for any patient receiving BeneFIX, if you are elderly your doctor will choose a specific dose appropriate for you.
-
- As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible.
The
product may contain traces of hamster proteins.
Potentially life-threatening anaphylactic reactions have occurred with factor IX products, including BeneFIX.
You will be informed of early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including difficult breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, low blood pressure and anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction that can cause difficulty in swallowing and/ or breathing, red or swollen face and/ or hands).
- If allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact a doctor
or seek emergency medical care immediately.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative therapy should be considered.
- There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor
IX inhibitor and allergic reactions.
Therefore, if you experience allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, swelling, hives, itching, tightness of the chest, wheezing, or hypotension, you should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor.
It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitor may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.
- The production of factor IX in the body is controlled by the factor IX gene.
Patients who have
major deletion mutations of their factor IX gene may be more likely to have factor IX inhibitor and an allergic reaction.
Therefore if you are known to have a major deletion mutation of the factor IX gene, your doctor will monitor you more closely for signs of an allergic reaction particularly when you first start to take BeneFIX.
- Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, your initial administrations of
factor IX should, according to the treating physician’ s judgement, be performed under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions can be provided.
- Even in the absence of factor IX inhibitor, higher doses of BeneFIX may be needed than required
for plasma-derived factor IX.
Therefore, close monitoring of factor IX plasma activity and pharmacokinetic assessment have to be performed in order to adjust doses as appropriate.
If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose, contact your doctor.
- If you suffer from a liver or cardiac disease or if you have recently had surgery, there is an
increased risk for coagulation complications.
- There have been reports of agglutination of red blood cells in the tube/ syringe with the
administration of BeneFIX.
So far, no clinical sequelae have been reported in association with this observation.
To minimize the possibility of agglutination, it is important to limit the amount of blood entering the tubing.
Blood should not enter the syringe.
If agglutination of red blood cells in the tubing/ syringe is observed, discard all this material (tubing, syringe and BeneFIX solution) and resume administration with a new package.
- A kidney disorder (nephrotic syndrome) has been reported following high doses of plasma derived
Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions.
154
- It is recommended that, whenever possible, every time you use BeneFIX, the name and batch
number of the product is registered.
Taking other medicines:
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding you should only take BeneFIX upon specific instructions from your physician.
It is not known whether BeneFIX can affect reproductive capacity or cause foetal harm when given to pregnant women.
Your doctor may advise you to stop treatment with BeneFIX if you are breast- feeding or become pregnant.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines:
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
3.
HOW TO TAKE BENEFIX
Always take BeneFIX exactly as your doctor has instructed you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Your doctor will decide the dose of BeneFIX you will receive.
This dose and duration will depend upon your individual needs for replacement factor IX therapy and upon pharmacokinetics (recovery and half- life) that have to be checked regularly.
You may notice a difference in the dose you receive if you are changing from a plasma-derived factor IX product to BeneFIX.
Your doctor may decide to change the dose of BeneFIX you receive during your treatment.
Reconstitution and administration
The procedures below are provided as guidelines for the reconstitution and administration of BeneFIX.
Patients should follow the specific venipuncture procedures provided by their physicians.
BeneFIX is administered by intravenous (IV) injection after reconstitution of the powder for injection with the supplied solvent (0.234% w/ v sodium chloride solution) in the pre-filled syringe.
Always wash your hands prior to performing the following procedures.
Aseptic technique (meaning clean and germ free) should be used during the reconstitution procedure.
Reconstitution:
BeneFIX will be administered by intravenous infusion (IV) after reconstitution with sterile solvent for injection.
1.
Allow the vial of lyophilised BeneFIX and the pre-filled syringe to reach room temperature.
155 2.
Remove the plastic flip-top cap from the BeneFIX vial to expose the central portion of the rubber stopper.
3.
Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab provided, or use another antiseptic solution and allow to dry.
After cleaning do not touch the rubber stopper with your hand or allow it to touch any surface.
4.
Peel back the lid from the clear plastic vial adapter package.
Do not remove the adapter from the package.
5.
Place the vial on a flat surface.
While holding the adapter in the package, place the vial adapter over the vial.
Press down firmly on the package until the adapter snaps into place on top of the vial, with the adapter spike penetrating the vial stopper.
6.
Lift the package away from the adapter and discard the package.
7.
Attach the plunger rod to the solvent syringe by pushing and turning firmly.
156 8.
Break off the tamper-resistant plastic tip cap from the solvent syringe by snapping the perforation of the cap.
This is done by bending the cap up and down until the perforation is broken.
Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip.
The cap may need to be replaced (if not administering reconstituted BeneFIX immediately), so set it aside by placing it on its top.
9.
Place the vial on a flat surface.
Connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by inserting the tip of the syringe into the adapter opening while firmly pushing and turning the syringe clockwise until the connection is secured.
10.
Slowly depress the plunger rod to inject all the solvent into the BeneFIX vial
11.
With the syringe still connected to the adapter, gently rotate the vial until the powder is dissolved.
12.
The final solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter before administration.
The solution should appear clear and colourless.
Note:
If you use more than one vial of BeneFIX per infusion, each vial should be reconstituted as per the previous instructions.
The solvent syringe should be removed, leaving the vial adapter in place, and a separate large luer lock syringe may be used to draw back the reconstituted contents of each individual vial.
157 13.
Ensuring that the syringe plunger rod is still fully depressed, invert the vial.
Slowly draw back all the solution into the syringe.
14.
Detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently pulling and turning the syringe counter- clockwise.
Discard the vial with the adapter attached.
Note:
If the solution is not to be used immediately, the syringe cap should be carefully replaced.
Do not touch the syringe tip or the inside of the cap.
BeneFIX should be administered immediately or within 3 hours after reconstitution.
The reconstituted solution may be stored at room temperature prior to administration.
Administration (Intravenous Injection):
BeneFIX should be administered using the pre-filled solvent syringe provided or a single sterile disposable plastic luer lock syringe.
In addition, the solution should be withdrawn from the vial using the vial adapter.
BeneFIX should be injected intravenously over several minutes.
Your doctor may change your recommended infusion rate to make the infusion more comfortable.
Because the use of BeneFIX by continuous infusion has not been evaluated, BeneFIX should not be mixed with infusion solutions or be given in a drip.
Please dispose of all unused solution, empty vials and used needles and syringes in an appropriate container for throwing away waste as it may hurt others if not handled properly.
If you take more BeneFIX than you should:
Please contact your doctor immediately if you inject more BeneFIX than your doctor recommends.
If you stop taking BeneFIX
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your physician or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, BeneFIX can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Should you experience a significant increase in your usage of BeneFIX in order to control a bleed, please contact your doctor immediately; your blood should be checked for inhibitors to factor IX activity.
158 Possible side effects are listed according to the following categories:
Uncommon: between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 patients Rare: between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 patients
Immune system disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors)* Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions; such reactions may include burning sensation in jaw and skull, chills (rigors), dry cough/ sneeze, flushing, lethargy, restlessness, tingling, hives, itching and rash, low blood pressure, fast heart rate, tightness of the chest, wheezing, swelling of the throat, anaphylaxis*, rash
Nervous system disorders
Uncommon:
Dizziness, headache, altered taste, lightheadedness
Gastrointestinal disorders
Uncommon:
Rare:
Nausea Vomiting
General disorders and administration site conditions
Uncommon:
Injection site reactions (including burning and stinging at the infusion site), discomfort at the IV site, cellulites, phlebitis
Rare:
Fever
* See additional information below.
Hypersensitivity/ allergic reactions
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been infrequently observed in patients treated with factor IX containing products, including BeneFIX.
In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis.
Allergic reactions have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitor (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
The aetiology of the allergic reactions to BeneFIX has not yet been elucidated.
These reactions are potentially life-threatening.
If allergic/ anaphylactic reactions occur, stop the infusion immediately and contact your doctor or seek emergency medical care immediately.
In case of severe allergic reactions, alternative therapy should be considered.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of side-effects (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
Inhibitor development
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX.
If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response.
In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted.
A clinically relevant, low responding inhibitor was detected in 1 out of 65 BeneFIX patients who had previously received plasma derived products.
This patient was able to continue treatment with BeneFIX with no rise in inhibitor or anaphylaxis.
Patients treated with BeneFIX should be monitored for inhibitor development.
159 There are insufficient data to provide information on inhibitor incidence in previously untreated patients (PUPs).
Due to the production process BeneFIX may contain trace amounts of hamster cell proteins.
Hypersensitivity responses can occur.
A kidney disorder has been reported following high doses of plasma derived Factor IX to induce immune tolerance in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions (see also “ Take special care with BeneFIX ”).
Renal
One patient developed severe abdominal pain which was caused by an area of the kidney that lacked the necessary blood supply (referred to as a renal infarct).
The relationship of the infarct to prior administration of BeneFIX is uncertain.
If any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side effect not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
