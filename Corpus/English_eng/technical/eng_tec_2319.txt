Since PHP 4.2.0, PHP returns an appropriate error code along with the file array.
The error code can be found in the ['error'] segment of the file array that is created during the file upload by PHP.
In otherwords, the error might be found in $_FILES[ 'userfile']['error'].
Value:
0; There is no error, the file uploaded with success.
Value:
1; The uploaded file exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini.
Value:
2; The uploaded file exceeds the MAX_FILE_SIZE directive that was specified in the html form.
Value:
3; The uploaded file was only partially uploaded.
Value:
4; No file was uploaded.
Note:
These became PHP constants in PHP 4.3.0
