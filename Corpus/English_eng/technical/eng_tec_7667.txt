Immunomodulation − Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), in children or adults at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery to correct the platelet count.
2 − Guillain Barré syndrome − Kawasaki disease
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Posology
The dose and dosage regimen are dependent on the indication.
In replacement therapy the dosage may need to be individualised for each patient depending on the pharmacokinetic and clinical response.
The following dosage regimens are given as a guideline.
Replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency syndromes The dosage regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG (measured before the next infusion) of at least 4-6 g/ l.
Three to six months are required after the initiation of therapy for equilibration to occur.
The recommended starting dose is 0.4-0.8 g/ kg body weight (BW) followed by at least 0.2 g/ kg BW every three weeks.
The dose required to achieve a trough level of 6 g/ l is of the order of 0.2-0.8 g/ kg BW/ month.
The dosage interval when steady state has been reached varies from 2 to 4 weeks.
Trough levels should be measured in order to adjust the dose and dosage interval.
Replacement therapy in myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with severe secondary hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections; replacement therapy in children with congenital AIDS and recurrent infections The recommended dose is 0.2-0.4 g/ kg BW every three to four weeks.
Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) For the treatment of an acute episode, 0.8-1 g/ kg BW on day one, which may be repeated once within 3 days, or 0.4 g/ kg BW daily for two to five days.
The treatment can be repeated if a relapse occurs.
Guillain Barré Syndrome 0.4 g/ kg BW/ day for 3 to 7 days.
Experience in children is limited.
Kawasaki Disease 1.6-2.0 g/ kg BW should be administered in divided doses over two to five days or 2.0 g/ kg BW as a single dose.
Patients should receive concomitant treatment with acetylsalicylic acid.
Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation Human normal immunoglobulin treatment can be used as part of the conditioning regimen and after the transplant.
For the treatment of infections and prophylaxis of graft versus host disease, dosage is individually tailored.
The starting dose is normally 0.5 g/ kg BW/ week, starting seven days before transplantation and for up to 3 months after transplantation.
In case of persistent lack of antibody production, dosage of 0.5 g/ kg BW/ month is recommended until the antibody level returns to normal.
The dosage recommendations are summarised in the following table:

Method of administration
Human normal immunoglobulin should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.5 ml/kg BW/hr for 30 minutes.
If well tolerated, the rate of administration may gradually be increased to a maximum of 6 ml/kg BW/hr.
Clinical data obtained from a limited number of patients also indicate that adult PID patients may tolerate an infusion rate of up to 8 ml/kg BW/hr.
KIOVIG should only be administered intravenously.
Other routes of administration have not been evaluated.
If dilution prior to infusion is required, KIOVIG may be diluted with 5% glucose solution to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml (5% immunoglobulin).
For details on dilution, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Hypersensitivity to homologous immunoglobulins, especially in very rare cases of IgA deficiency when the patient has antibodies against IgA.
4 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Certain severe adverse reactions may be related to the rate of infusion.
The recommended infusion rate given under “4.2 Method of administration” must be closely followed.
Patients must be closely monitored and carefully observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion period.
Certain adverse reactions may occur more frequently − in case of high rate of infusion − in patients with hypo- or agammaglobulinemia with or without IgA deficiency − in patients who receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when the human normal immunoglobulin product is switched or when there has been a long interval since the previous infusion.
True hypersensitivity reactions are rare.
They can occur in the very seldom cases of IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies.
Rarely, human normal immunoglobulin can induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactic reaction, even in patients who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin.
Potential complications can often be avoided by ensuring − that patients are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin by first infusing the product slowly (0.01 ml/kg BW/min); − that patients are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period.
In particular, patients naive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative IVIg product or when there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored during the first infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion, in order to detect potential adverse signs.
All other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after administration.
There is clinical evidence of an association between IVIg administration and thromboembolic events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis which is assumed to be related to a relative increase in blood viscosity through the high influx of immunoglobulin.
Caution should be exercised in prescribing and infusion of IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic episodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, severely hypovolemic patients, patients with diseases which increase blood viscosity.
Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients receiving IVIg therapy.
In most cases, risk factors have been identified, such as pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypovolemia, overweight, concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age over 65.
In case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation should be considered.
While these reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many of the licensed IVIg products, those containing sucrose as a stabilizer accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number.
In patients at risk, the use of IVIg products that do not contain sucrose may be considered.
In patients at risk for acute renal failure or thromboembolic adverse reactions, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of infusion and dose practicable.
In all patients, IVIg administration requires: − adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the infusion of IVIg − monitoring of urine output − monitoring of serum creatinine levels − avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics
5 In case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped.
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
If dilution of KIOVIG to lower concentrations is required for patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, the use of 5% glucose solution for dilution may have to be reconsidered.
KIOVIG is made from human plasma.
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses.
Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infectious agents cannot be totally excluded.
This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV, and for the non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19.
There is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or Parvovirus B19 transmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an important contribution to the viral safety.
It is strongly recommended that every time that KIOVIG is administered to a patient, the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the product.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interactions
Live attenuated virus vaccines Immunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months the efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella.
After administration of this product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with live attenuated virus vaccines.
In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year.
Therefore patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked.
Interference with serological testing After infusion of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patients blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing.
Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g.
A, B, D, may interfere with some serological tests for red cell antibodies, for example the antiglobulin test (Coombs test).
In case of dilution with a 5% glucose solution, the KIOVIG administration may interfere with determination of blood glucose levels.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical trials and therefore it should only be given with caution to pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers.
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are to be expected.
Immunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may contribute to the transfer of protective antibodies to the neonate.
6 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been observed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
With human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration, adverse reactions such as chills, headache, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally.
Rarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated cases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous administration.
Cases of reversible aseptic meningitis, isolated cases of reversible haemolytic anaemia/haemolysis, transient increases in liver transaminases and rare cases of transient cutaneous reactions have been observed with human normal immunoglobulin.
Increase in serum creatinine level and/or acute renal failure have been observed.
Very rarely:
Thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thromboses.
Two clinical trials with KIOVIG were performed in primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients in Europe and the US.
In the European study, 22 subjects with hypo- and agammaglobulinemia received KIOVIG for about 6 months.
The US clinical trial was performed with 61 subjects with PID, who received KIOVIG for about 12 months.
In Europe, an additional clinical study in 23 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was performed.
No serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) was observed during the studies, with the exception of two episodes of aseptic meningitis in one patient of the US PID study, which were deemed possibly related to the medicinal product.
Most ADRs observed were mild to moderate in nature.
In the European and US PID studies the overall rate of ADRs per infusion was 0.27.
As expected due to the much higher dosage, the ADR rate per infusion was higher (0.49) in the ITP trial; 87.5% of these ADRs were assessed as mild.
The non-serious ADRs reported in the three studies are summarized and categorized according to the MedDRA System organ class and frequency in the table below.
Frequency has been evaluated using the following criteria: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, for intravascular administration, ATC code:
J06BA02
Human normal immunoglobulin contains mainly functionally intact immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of antibodies against infectious agents.
Human normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population.
It is usually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1000 donations.
It has a distribution of immunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma.
Adequate doses of human normal immunoglobulin may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G levels to the normal range.
The mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but includes immunomodulatory effects.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Human normal immunoglobulin is immediately and completely bioavailable in the recipient’s circulation after intravenous administration.
It is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and extravascular fluid; after approximately 3 to 5 days equilibrium is reached between the intra- and extravascular compartments.
Pharmacokinetic parameters for KIOVIG were determined in the two clinical studies in PID patients performed in Europe and the US.
In these studies, a total of 83 subjects at least 2 years of age were treated with doses of 300 to 600 mg/kg body weight every 21 to 28 days for 6 to 12 months.
The median IgG half-life after administration of KIOVIG was 32.5 days.
This half-life may vary from patient to patient, in particular in primary immunodeficiency.
Pharmacokinetic parameters for the product are summarized in the table below.
All parameters were analysed separately for three age groups, children (below 12 years, n=5), adolescents (13 to 17 years, n=10), and adults (above 18 years of age, n=64).
The values obtained in the studies are comparable to parameters reported for other human immunoglobulins.

9 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Immunoglobulins are normal constituents of the human body.
The safety of KIOVIG has been demonstrated in several non-clinical studies.
Non-clinical data reveal no special risk for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and toxicity.
Studies of repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction in animals are impracticable due to induction of and interference by developing antibodies to heterologous proteins.
Since clinical experience provides no evidence for carcinogenic potential of immunoglobulins, no experimental studies in heterogeneous species were performed.

1.
WHAT KIOVIG IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
KIOVIG belongs to a class of medications called immunoglobulins.
These medicines contain human antibodies, which are also present in your blood.
Antibodies help your body to fight infections.
Medicines like KIOVIG are used in patients who do not have enough antibodies in their blood and tend to get frequent infections.
They can also be used in patients who need additional antibodies for the cure of certain inflammatory disorders (autoimmune diseases).
KIOVIG is used for
Treatment of patients who do not have sufficient antibodies (replacement therapy).
There are three groups:
1.
Patients with inborn lack of antibodies (primary immunodeficiency syndromes (PID)) such as:
– – – –
congenital agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency, severe combined immunodeficiencies, Wiskott Aldrich syndrome.
2.
Patients with diseases of the blood that lead to a lack of antibody production and recurrent infections (myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with severe secondary hypogammaglobulinemia).
3.
Children who suffer from inborn AIDS and get frequent infections.
Treatment of patients with certain inflammatory disorders (immunomodulation).
There are three groups:
1.
Patients who do not have enough blood platelets (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, ITP), and who are at high risk of bleeding or will have surgery in the near future.
2.
Patients with a disease that is associated with multiple inflammations of the nerves in the whole body (Guillain Barré syndrome).
3.
Patients with a disease which results in multiple inflammations of several organs of the body (Kawasaki disease).
24 Treatment or prevention of infections after a bone marrow transplantation (allogeneic bone marrow transplantation).
2.
BEFORE YOU USE KIOVIG
KIOVIG must not be used
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to immunoglobulins or to any other ingredient of KIOVIG.
For example, if you have an immunoglobulin A deficiency, you may have antibodies against immunoglobulin A in your blood.
Since KIOVIG contains trace amounts of immunoglobulin A (less than 0.14 mg/ml), you might get an allergic reaction.
Take special care with KIOVIG
How long monitoring is required during the infusion • You will be carefully observed during the infusion period with KIOVIG to make sure that you do not suffer a reaction.
Your doctor will make sure that the rate at which KIOVIG is infused is suitable for you. • If KIOVIG is administered at a high rate, if you suffer from a condition with low antibody levels in your blood (hypo- or agammaglobulinemia), if you have not received this medicine before or if there has been a long interval (e.g. several weeks) since you last received it, there may be a higher risk of side effects.
In such cases, you will be closely monitored during your infusion and for an hour after your infusion has stopped. • If you have already received KIOVIG previously and received the last treatment recently, then you will only be observed during the infusion and for at least 20 minutes after your infusion.
When slowing or stopping the infusion may be required In rare cases your body may have previously reacted to specific antibodies and therefore will be sensitive to medicines containing antibodies.
This may happen particularly if you suffer from immunoglobulin A deficiency.
In these rare cases, you may get allergic reactions such as a sudden fall in blood pressure or shock even if you have already received treatment with medicines containing antibodies in the past.
If you experience a reaction during the infusion of KIOVIG, tell your doctor immediately.
Depending on your doctor’s decision the rate of infusion can be slowed or the infusion can be stopped altogether.
Special patient groups • Your doctor will take special care if you are overweight, elderly, diabetic, or if you suffer from high blood pressure, low blood volume (hypovolaemia), or problems with your blood vessels (vascular diseases).
In these conditions, immunoglobulins may increase the risk of cardiac infarction, stroke, lung embolism, or deep vein thrombosis, although only in very rare cases.
Tell your doctor if you are diabetic.
Although KIOVIG does not contain sugar, it may be diluted with a special sugar solution (5% glucose), which could affect your blood sugar level. • Your doctor will also take special care if you have or had previously problems with your kidneys, or if you receive medicinal products that may harm your kidney (nephrotoxic medicinal products), as there is a very rare chance of acute kidney failure.
Please tell your doctor if you have a kidney disorder.
Your doctor will choose the appropriate intravenous immunoglobulin for you.
Information on the source material of KIOVIG KIOVIG is made from human plasma (the liquid part of blood).
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, a number of measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on to patients.
These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections.
Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or
25 plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses.
Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded.
This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.
The measures taken for the manufacture of KIOVIG are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non- enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19.
KIOVIG also contains certain antibodies that can prevent an infection with hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19.
Taking other medicines
• Please inform your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription, or if you have received a vaccination during the last six weeks. • Infusion of immunoglobulins like KIOVIG may impair the effect of some live virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and chicken pox.
Therefore, after receiving these medicines you may have to wait up to 3 months before receiving your live-attenuated vaccine.
You may have to wait for up to 1 year after receiving immunoglobulins before you receive your measles vaccine.
Effects on blood tests
KIOVIG contains a wide variety of different antibodies, some of which can affect blood tests.
If you have a blood test after receiving KIOVIG, please inform the person taking your blood or your doctor that you have received the medication.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
• Please inform your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Your doctor will decide if KIOVIG may be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding. • No clinical trials have been made with KIOVIG in pregnant or breast-feeding women.
However, medicines that contain antibodies have been used in pregnant or breast-feeding women for years, and it has been shown that there are no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy or the baby to be expected. • If you are breast-feeding and receive KIOVIG, the antibodies of the medicine can also be found in the breast milk.
Therefore, your baby may be protected from certain infections.
Driving and using machines
KIOVIG has no influence on your ability to drive or use machines.
3.
HOW TO USE KIOVIG
KIOVIG is intended for intravenous administration (infusion into a vein).
It is given to you by your doctor or nurse.
Dosage will vary depending on your condition and your body weight.
At the beginning of your infusion you will receive KIOVIG at a slow rate.
Dependent on how comfortable you are, your doctor may then gradually increase the infusion rate.
If you use more KIOVIG than you should
If you get more KIOVIG than you should, your blood may become too thick (hyperviscous).
This could particularly happen when you are a patient at risk, e.g. an elderly patient or a patient having problems with your kidneys.
26 4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, KIOVIG can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
However, possible side effects may be reduced by slowing the infusion rate.
• General reactions such as chills, headaches, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, joint pain, low blood pressure and moderate lower back pain have been experienced occasionally.Rarely, cases of a sudden fall in blood pressure were observed, and in isolated cases allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock), even in patients who have shown no reactions to previous infusions. • Cases of temporary meningitis (reversible aseptic meningitis), isolated cases of temporary decrease of red blood cells (reversible haemolytic anaemia/haemolysis), transient increases in liver function values (liver transaminases) and rare cases of eczema-like symptoms (transient cutaneous reactions) have been observed with immunoglobulin products. • An increase in blood creatinine content and kidney failure has also been observed. • Very rarely, cases of blood clot formation in the veins (thromboembolic reactions) resulting in cardiac infarction, stroke, lung defects (pulmonary embolism), and deep vein thrombosis have been reported which may be related to the infusion of immunoglobulins.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) web site: http://www.emea.europa.eu/.
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
Method of administration
• KIOVIG must only be administered intravenously.
Other routes of administration have not been evaluated. • KIOVIG should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.5 ml/kg bodyweight/hour for 30 minutes.
If well tolerated, the rate of administration may gradually be increased to a maximum of 6 ml/kg bodyweight/hour.
Clinical data obtained from a limited number of patients also indicate that adult PID patients may tolerate an infusion rate of up to 8 ml/kg BW/hr. • If dilution to lower concentrations is required prior to infusion, KIOVIG may be diluted with 5% glucose solution to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml (5% immunoglobulin).
Special precautions
• Any infusion-related adverse events should be treated by lowering the infusion rate or by stopping the infusion. • It is recommended that every time KIOVIG is administered, the name and batch number of the product is recorded.
Incompatibilities
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products.
Special precautions for storage
• After dilution to lower concentrations, immediate use is recommended.
The in-use stability of KIOVIG after dilution with a 5% glucose solution to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml (5% immunoglobulin) has been demonstrated for 21 days at 2°C to 8°C as well as at 28°C to 30°C; however, these studies did not include the microbial contamination and safety aspects.
Instructions for handling and disposal
• The product must be brought to room or body temperature before use.
30 • KIOVIG should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.
Only clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow solutions are to be administered.
Do not use if particulate matter or discolouration is observed. • If dilution is required, 5% glucose solution is recommended.
For obtaining an immunoglobulin solution of 50 mg/ml (5%), KIOVIG 100 mg/ml (10%) should be diluted with an equal volume of the glucose solution.
It is recommended that during dilution the risk of microbial contamination is minimised. • Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
