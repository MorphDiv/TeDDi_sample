Introduction
& kontact; is the integrated solution for personal information management. It combines the well-known & kde; applications for email, scheduling, address book, notes, and newsgroups (kmail;, & korganizer;, & kaddressbook;, & knotes;, and & knode;) into a single interface. Being based on a true component framework & kontact; provides exactly the same functionality as the stand-alone applications, and adds more features, by making use of the integrated way & kontact; runs the applications as components. Users still retain the choice of which applications are run within & kontact; and which are run stand-alone.
In addition to the functionality of the individual applications & kontact; provides, a summary view and advanced drag & drop features between components.
& kontact; Components
& kontact; integrates the following applications. See the individual application manuals for details on how to use them. These apply to running them as components inside & kontact; just as well as running them stand-alone.
& kmail;
The & kde; mail client.
& korganizer;
The & kde; calendar and scheduling application.
& kaddressbook;
The & kde; contact manager.
& knotes;
The & kde; sticky notes application.
& knode;
The & kde; news reader.
& akregator;
The & kde; RSS feed reader.
& ktimetracker;
The & kde; time tracker tool.
& kpilot;
The & kde; Pilot synchronization application.
& kitchensync;
The & kde; data synchronization application.
& kpilot; and & kitchensync; serve two different purposes. Currently, & kpilot; can be used to synchronize data with your Pilot device. & kitchensync;, on the other hand, is a more general-purpose framework that allows you to synchronize your data across different computers.
The & kontact; Main Window
The main window consists of a side pane on the left showing the icons of the available components, the main view on the right which contains the main window of the active component and the usual menu, tool and status bars.
Side Pane
The side pane serves multiple purposes. It allows for switching between components, shows which component is active and serves as the target for drag & drop operations to the different applications.
kontact; 's Side Pane
kontact; 's Side Pane
kontact; 's Side Pane
For switching between components simply click on the corresponding icon. The main window of the component is shown and the menu, tool and status bars are adapted to reflect the functionality of the active component. If you activate a component for the first time there might be a small delay until the main view is changed, because components are loaded on demand. This means you do n't waste memory for components you do n't use.
The icons in the side pane can also be used as targets for drag & drop operations. For example, you can drag a mail from the mail part and drop it on the icon of the to-do list or the calendar to create a to-do or event associated with this mail.
Finally, you can change the size of the icons in the side pane. Right-clicking on the side pane will give you the option to use Large, Normal, or Small icons, as well as the option to use text only instead of icons.
If you dislike the sidebar, you can simply hide it by dragging the splitter. An alternative navigation between parts is provided by the Navigator toolbar, which can be freely positioned. See for more on the Navigator toolbar.
Main View
The view on the right which takes up most of the area of the & kontact; main window shows the active component. This exactly corresponds to the main window the component uses when run as a stand-alone application. The highlighted icon in the side pane indicates to which application the main view belongs. & kontact; remembers which component was active, so when starting & kontact; the view initially shows which one was activated when exiting & kontact; the last time.

In addition, there are two ways of overriding the component that & kontact; starts in. The first is as an argument to the & kontact; program call (see). The second is a setting in the & kontact; Settings dialog that will allow you to always start & kontact; in a certain mode.
To get to it, go to Settings Configure Kontact and click on Kontact in the list.

Menu, Tool and Status Bars
The menu, tool and status bars are adapted to the active component. That means that, in addition to some common functions like the help menu which are shown for all components, there are actions which are switched when the active component is switched. These actions available for each component are the same ones which are also available when running the application stand-alone.

In addition, & kontact; can show a Navigator toolbar, which allows you access to the & kontact; components very much like the side pane does. However, unlike the side pane, buttons in the Navigator toolbar cannot be used for drag & drop operations to other components.
To activate the toolbar, select Settings Toolbars Navigator (Kontact).

A special action common to all components is the New action. It allows creation of new objects like emails, contacts, appointments and to-dos independently of which component is active. The component responsible for processing the selected object is started, if required, and takes over the created object.

Drag and Drop Functionality
& kontact; provides advanced drag and drop functionality between the programs it contains. Following is a brief description of each of the specific drag and drop operations that can be used and the result of each.
& kmail; -gt; & korganizer; To-do List
Dragging a message from kmail; 's Headers pane to the icon for & korganizer; 's To-do list () will create a new To-do with Mail: Subject as the title and From: Sender To: Receiver Subject: Subject as the contents (where text that looks like this is information from the message itself), as well as the email message itself as an attachment.
& kmail; -gt; & korganizer; Calendar
Dragging a message from kmail; 's Headers pane to the icon for & korganizer; 's Calendar () will create a new Event with Mail: Subject as the title and From: Sender To: Receiver Subject: Subject as the contents (where text that looks like this is information from the message itself), as well as the email message itself as an attachment.
Note that dragging onto the To-do button creates a To-do, whereas dragging onto the Calendar creates an Event. More on this distinction is available in the korganizer; documentation
& kmail; -gt; & kaddressbook;
Dragging a message from kmail; 's Headers pane to the icon for & kaddressbook; () will create a contact from the email address of the sender, unless a contact with that name already exists. A dialog box notifies you of this action.
& kaddressbook; -gt; & korganizer; To-do List
Dragging any number of entries from kaddressbook; 's main window to the icon for & korganizer; 's To-do List () will create a new To-do with & quot; Meetingquot; as the title and the selected contacts as attendees.
& kaddressbook; -gt; & korganizer; Calendar
Dragging any number of entries from kaddressbook; 's main window to the icon for & korganizer; 's Calendar () will create a new Event with & quot; Meetingquot; as the title and the selected contacts as attendees.
Keyboard Shortcuts
& kontact; provides several global keyboard shortcuts for easier access to certain features. Below is a list of the default shortcuts; however, note that you can configure the keyboard shortcuts by going to Settings Configure Shortcuts... and scrolling to the Kontact item in the list.

The shortcuts mentioned below for switching components vary slightly depending on the components you have activated (see). In general, the components can be activated by using & Ctrl; in conjunction with a number; the number can be determined by counting how many items from the top the component is in the side pane.
The following are the default shortcuts for & kontact;:
Summary View
& Ctrl; 1

New Item changes depending on what component is currently selected. It is New Message for the Summary and Mail components, New Contact for the Contact component, New Event for the Calendar component, New To-do for the To-do list component, New Journal for the Journal component, New Note for the Notes component, New Feed for the Feeds component, and New Article for the Usenet component. Each of these actions has its own keyboard shortcut as listed below.

The Summary View
The default view when starting & kontact; for the first time is the summary view. It shows an overview of the most relevant information provided by the selected & kontact; components. These can be newsticker headlines, imminent appointments or birthdays, due to-dos, weather data, & etc; Which information is shown is configurable by selecting the corresponding components in the kontact; configuration dialog.

If you think the information you see is outdated, you can click on the Refresh button () in the Summary View toolbar to refresh the data.
Repositioning Summary View Components
The Summary View allows you to change where the components are in the view itself. So, if you prefer to have your Special Dates in the lower left and your to-dos in the upper right, you can rearrange the summary view to reflect that.
Repositioning components in the Summary View is as simple as dragging them to the new location you want them to be in. Click and hold on the grey title area of the component and drag the component to wherever you want it to be. Note that this positioning is done compared to other components. So you can move the Mail component to be below the to-do component in the view, but you cannot place it in a specific position. If you have only one component in your summary view, the only option is to move it between the two columns of the view; two components can either be two in one column or one in each column; and so on and so forth. Whenever you are dragging a component, you will see a small preview box following your mouse around showing you the component.

Configuring & kontact;
& kontact; Configuration Window
When selecting the Configure & kontact; action from the Settings menu, the & kontact; configuration dialog is shown. It provides a list of the configurations for all the active components of & kontact;. You can click the - symbol next to the component names to collapse their options so that you can view the options for the component you are looking for. Selecting one of the configuration options under a heading will bring up that configuration section on the right.

In addition, by clicking on the Configure... button, you can bring up a dialog that will allow you to select which components you want active from a list. By checking the box next to the component title you select the component to be put into the side bar and the summary view. The component is loaded and its main view is shown in the main window when clicking on its icon in the side pane for the first time. By unchecking the check box the component is removed from the side pane and summary view. Changes become effective by clicking the Apply or OK button.

Configuring & kontact; 's Summary View
When you select Configure Summary View... from the & kontact; Settings menu (only available in Summary View), a dialog pops up that allows you to select which summary plugins & kontact; should show in its summary view. Here is a brief list of the currently available plugins and what they do:
& kontact; 1.1.1 no longer includes the Contacts Summary plugin that shows Birthdays and Anniversaries; instead, you can use the Special Dates plugin (see) to show these dates, as well.
& kontact; Summary Plugins: Calendar
The Calendar plugin for & kontact; 's Summary View adds an area in the view labeled Appointments. This will display any appointments that currently apply.
kontact; Calendar Summary Plugin
kontact; Calendar Summary Plugin
kontact; Calendar Summary Plugin
& kontact; Summary Plugins: & kpilot;
The kpilot; plugin for & kontact; 's Summary View adds an area in the view labeled KPilot Information. This area contains a lot of information from & kpilot;, including:
Last synchronization (with sync log)
User who last synchronized
Device last synchronized

& kontact; Summary Plugins: NewsTicker
The NewsTicker plugin for & kontact; 's Summary View adds an area in the view labeled News Feeds. This area contains the latest news from the currently configured news feeds. You can add and remove feeds in & kontact; 's Summary View Configuration. Please note that as of & kde; 3.4, the more efficient way of accessing RSS feed information is the new & akregator; application, which provides notifications instead of requiring constant checking of the Summary View to see if new articles have appeared.
The NewsTicker plugin is not available unless you have installed the kdenetwork package. Some distributions may offer & knewsticker; as a separate package.

& kontact; Summary Plugins: Special Dates
The Special Dates plugin for & kontact; 's Summary View adds an area in the view labeled Special Dates. This area contains information based on the criteria selected in the configuration area of the plugin in & kontact; 's Summary View configuration. The Special Dates plugin is especially useful because it can display birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, and special occasions from both the calendar and the contact list in one place.
& kontact; Summary Plugins: Weather
The Weather plugin for & kontact; 's Summary View adds an area in the view labeled Weather Information. This area contains the information for currently configured weather locations. For more information about configuring KWeather, the weather reporter used as a plugin within & kontact;, see the KWeather documentation.

& kontact; On the Command Line
& kontact; has several command line arguments that can be used for certain actions.
First of all, & kontact; supports command line arguments that all & kde; /Qt; applications support. You can get a full list of these by typing:
percnt; kontact --help-all
& kontact; also supports several command line arguments specific to it.
Command Line Arguments
Module-related Arguments
To get a list of available & kontact; modules, you can type:
percnt; kontact --list
Then, to start & kontact; with a module active, type:
percnt; kontact --module moduleName
Where moduleName is one of the modules obtained using the previous command.
Startup-related Arguments
To start & kontact; in iconified mode Iconified mode is also called minimized; it is when the application window is hidden and the application is available only in the taskbar., you can type:
percnt; kontact --iconify
Under The Hood
& kontact; makes extensive use of several & kde; key technologies, most notably KParts and & DCOP;.
The & GUI; integration of the components is done by plugins providing KParts versions of the applications. This only needs a thin additional layer on top of the already existing code of the stand-alone applications.
For communication between the components & DCOP; is used. This has the nice characteristic that it is completely transparent to whether the application is run stand-alone or embedded as KPart into & kontact;. When running inside of & kontact; an efficient in-process mode of & DCOP; is used.
