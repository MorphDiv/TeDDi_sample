The Undo History dialog
This dialog shows you a list of the actions you have most recently performed on an image, with a small sketch that attempts to illustrate the changes produced by each. You can revert the image to any point in its Undo History simply by clicking on the right entry in the list. For more information on GIMP's Undo mechanism and how it works, see the section on

The most basic thing you can do is to select a point in the Undo History by clicking on it in the list. You can go back and forth between states in this way as much as you please, without losing any information or consuming any resources. In most cases, the changes are very fast.

When your mask is ready, click again on the bottom-left button in the image window and the quick mask will be removed from the channel list and converted to a selection.
Quick mask's purpose is to paint a selection and its transitions with the paint tools without worrying about managing selection masks. It's a good way to isolate a subject in a picture because once the selection is made you only have to remove its content (or inverse if the subject is in the selection).
Using Quick Mask with a gradient
Description
Screenshot of the image window with activated QuickMask. As long as the Quickmask is activated, all operations are done on it. A gradient from black (left) to white (right) has been applied to the mask.
The QuickMask is now disabled. The selection occupies the right half part of the image (marching ants) because the limit of the selection is at the middle of the gradient.
A stroke is now added during the enabled selection. Weird! The gradient, although not visible, remains active all over the image, in selected and non selected areas!
After the QuickMask Button is pressed, the command generates a temporary 8-bit (0-255) channel, on which the progressive selection work is stored. If a selection is already present the mask is initialized with the content of the selection. Once QuickMask has been activated, the image is covered by a red semi-transparent veil. This one represents the non-selected pixels. Any

Masks

Overview
A transparency mask can be added to each layer, it's called Layer mask. A layer mask has the same size and same number of pixels as the layer to which it is attached. Every pixel of the mask can then be coupled with a pixel at the same location in the layer. The mask is a set of pixels in gray-tone on a value scale from 0 to 255. The pixels with a value 0 are black and give a full transparency to the coupled pixel in the layer. The pixels with a value 255 are white and give a full opacity to the coupled pixel in the layer.
To create a layer mask start with a right click on the layer to call the context menu and select








When the mask is created it appears as a thumbnail right to the layer thumbnail. By clicking alternatively on the layer and mask thumbnail you can enable one or other. The active item has a white border (which is not well visible around a white mask). That's an important point. Always keep the Layers Dialog prominently when working with masks, because you can't see, looking at the canvas, which of the layer or the mask is active.
Pressing
Layer Mask example
A layer with layer mask
This image has a background layer with a flower and another blue one, fully opaque. A white layer mask has been added to the blue layer. In the image window, the blue layer remains visible because a white mask makes layer pixels visible.
Painting the layer mask
The layer mask is active. You paint with black color, which makes the layer transparent: the underlying layer becomes visible.

In front of the thumbnail is an icon showing an eye. By clicking on the eye, you toggle whether the layer is visible or not. (
Chain layers
Another icon, showing a chain, allows you to group layers for operations on more than one layer at a time (for example with the Move tool).
Layer thumbnail
The layer content is represented in a thumbnail. Maintaining left-click for a second on this thumbnail makes it larger. When the layer is active, the thumbnail has a white border. The border is black if the layer is inactive. When the layer has a mask, the inactive element takes a black border.

Colormaps and Indexed Images
In an Indexed image, instead of being assigned a color directly (as happens in RGB and Grayscale images), colors are assigned to pixels by an indirect method, using a look-up table called a
To determine the color that should be shown for that pixel, GIMP looks up the index in the image's colormap. Each indexed image has its own private colormap. In GIMP, the maximum number of entries in a colormap is 256. For a maximum-sized colormap, each index from 0 to 255 is assigned an arbitrary RGB color. There are no rules restricting the colors that can be assigned to an index or the order they appear in: any index can be assigned any color.
It is important to realize that the colors in the colormap are the
The Colormap dialog allows you to alter the colormap for an image, either by creating new entries, or by changing the colors for the existing entries. If you change the color associated with a given index, you will see the changes reflected throughout the image, as a color shift for all pixels that are assigned that index. The entries are numbered with 0 in the upper left corner, 1 to its right, etc.
Using the Colormap dialog
Here are the operations you can perform using this dialog:
Click on a color entry
This sets GIMP's foreground color to the color you click on, as shown in the Toolbox color area. As a result, this color will be used for the next painting operation you do.

This sets
Double-click on a color entry
This sets GIMP's foreground color to the color you click on, and also brings up a Color Editor that allows you to change that colormap entry to a new color.

You can select a different colormap entry by typing its index here, or clicking the spinbutton to the right.
HTML-Notation
This area shows a hex-code representation (such as is used in HTML) for the color assigned to the currently selected colormap entry. You can edit the color here, instead of using a Color Editor, if you want to. See
Edit color
This button (in the lower left corner of the dialog) brings up a Color Editor that allows you to change the color for the currently selected colormap entry. The effect is similar to double-clicking on the entry, except that it does not set GIMP's foreground color.

About Histograms
In GIMP, each layer of an image can be decomposed into one or more color channels: for an RGB image, into R, G, and B channels; for a grayscale image, into a single Value channel. Layers that support transparency have an additional channel, the alpha channel. Each channel supports a range of intensity levels from 0 to 255 (integer valued). Thus, a black pixel is encoded by 0 on all color channels; a white pixel by 255 on all color channels. A transparent pixel is encoded by 0 on the alpha channel; an opaque pixel by 255.
For RGB images, it is convenient to define a Value
For more information on channels, please consult the
Using the Histogram dialog
The active layer name is shown at the top of the dialog.
Channel
Channel options for an RGB layer with alpha channel
This allows you to select which channel to use. The possibilities depend on the layer type of the active layer. Here are the entries you might see, and what they mean:
Value
For RGB and Grayscale images, this shows the distribution of brightness values across the layer. For a grayscale image, these are read directly from the image data. For an RGB image, they are taken from the Value pseudochannel.
For an indexed image, the
Red, Green, Blue
These only appear for layers from RGB images. They show the distribution of intensity levels for the Red, Green, or Blue channels respectively.
Alpha
This shows the distribution of opacity levels. If the layer is completely transparent (alphanbsp;=nbsp;0) or completely opaque (alphanbsp;=nbsp;255), the histogram will consist of a single bar on the left or right edge.
Combined histograms of R, G, and B channels.
This entry, only available for RGB layers, shows the R, G, and B histograms superimposed, so that you can see all of the color distribution information in a single view.
Linear
The histogram shown at the top, changed to logarithmic mode.
These buttons determine whether the histogram will be displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. For images taken from photographs, the linear mode is most commonly useful. For images that contain substantial areas of constant color, though, a linear histogram will often be dominated by a single bar, and a logarithmic histogram will often be more useful.
Range Setting
Dialog aspect after range fixing.
You can restrict the analysis, for the statistics shown at the bottom of the dialog, to a limited range of values if you wish. You can set the range in one of three ways:
Click and drag the pointer across the histogram display area, from the lowest level to the highest level of the range you want.
Click and drag the black or white triangles on the slider below the histogram.
Use the spinbutton entries below the slider (left entry: bottom of range; right entry: top of range).
Statistics
At the bottom of the dialog some basic statistics are shown describing the distribution of channel values, restricted to the selected range:

The gradient editor
The Gradient Editor allows you to edit the colors in a gradient. It can only be used on gradients you have created yourself (or on a copy of a system gradient), not on system gradients that come pre-installed with GIMP.

Blending and coloring functions for segment
Blending Function for Segment
The Blending Function submenu
This option determines the course of the transition from one endpoint of the range (segment or selection) to the other, by fitting the specified type of function to the endpoints and midpoint of the range:
Linear
Default option. Color varies linearly from one endpoint of the range to the other.
Curved
Gradient varies more quickly on ends of the range than on its middle.
Sinusoidal
The opposite of the curved type. Gradients varies more quickly on center of the range than on its ends.
Spherical (increasing)
Gradient varies more quickly on the left of the range than on its right.
Spherical (decreasing)
Gradient varies more quickly on the right than on the left.
Coloring Type for Segment
The Coloring Type submenu
This option gives you additional control of the type of transition from one endpoint to the other: as a line either in RGB space or in HSV space.
Modifying segments
Flip Segment
This option does a right-to-left flip of the selected range (segment or selection), flipping all colors and endpoint locations.
Replicate Segment
This option splits the selected range (segment or selection) into two parts, each of which is a perfect compressed copy of the original range.
Split Segment at Midpoint
This option splits each segment in the selected range in into two segments, splitting at the location of the white triangle.
Split Segment Uniformly
This option is similar to the previous one, but it splits each segment halfway between the endpoints, instead of at the white triangle.
Delete Segment
This option deletes all segments in the selected range, (segment or selection) replacing them with a single black triangle at the center, and enlarging the segments on both sides to fill the void.
Re-center Segment's midpoint
This option moves the white triangle for each segment in the selected range to a point halfway between the neighboring black triangles.
Re-distribute Handles in Segment
This option causes the black and white triangles in the selected range to be shifted so that the distances from one to the next are all equal.
Blending colors
These options are available only if more than one segment are selected.
Blend Endpoints' Colors
This option causes the colors at interior endpoints in the range to be averaged, so that the transition from each segment to the next is smooth.

Gradient CSS code snippet
The CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) language is used to format the display of HTML and XML files, for instance background color, font size... and background gradient. The "CSS Save" plugin is a CSS3 linear gradient generator that allows you to save a CSS3 code snippet, containing the gradient data for a given GIMP gradient. This code snippet is a text file: you can copy-paste it to the stylesheet related to your HTML file, to get a gradient background on opening the HTML file in Firefox, Chrome or Safari web navigators. This CSS3 code snippet can also be used as a gradient in SVG files.
Here is an example of code snippet, got using the Blue Green gradient:

With the slider, which is right apart from the color palette, you can set the color quantity per every mouse click. The higher the sliding control is, the more color is taken up per click.

Channel mask
Quick mask
A selection composed out of channels.
Channels can be used to save and restore your selections. In the channel dialog you can see a thumbnail representing the selection. Selection Masks are a graphical way to build selections into a gray level channel where white pixels are selected and black pixels are not selected. Therefore gray pixels are partially selected. You can think of them as feathering the selection, a smooth transition between selected and not selected. This is important to avoid the ugly pixelization effect when you fill the selection or when you erase its content after isolating a subject from background.

There are several ways to initialize a selection mask.
Using Selection Masks
Once the channel is initialized, selected (highlighted in blue), visible (eye-icon in the dialog), and displayed as you want (color and opacity attributes), you can start to work with all the paint tools. The colors used are important. If you paint with some color other than white, grey, or black, the color Value (luminosity) will be used to define a gray (medium, light, or dark). When your mask is painted, you can transform it to a selection by clicking on the
You can work in selection masks not only with the paint tool but also with other tools. For instance, you can use the selection tools to fill areas uniformly with gradients or patterns. By adding many selection masks in your list you can easily compose very complex selections. One can say that a selection mask is to a selection as a layer is to an image.
As long as a selection mask is activated you are working in the mask and not in the image. To work in the image you have to deactivate all selection masks. Don't forget also to stop displaying masks in the image by removing the eye icon. Check also that all RGB and Alpha channels are activated and displayed in the image.

Activated channels appear highlighted (generally) in blue in the dialog. If you click on a channel in the list you toggle activation of the corresponding channel. Disabling a color channel red, blue, or green has severe consequences.

Shape
A circle, a square and a diamond are available. You will modify them by using the following options:
Radius
Distance between brush center and edge, in the width direction. A square with a 10 pixels radius will have a 20 pixels side. A diamond with a 5 pixels radius will have a 10 pixels width.
Spikes
This parameter is useful only for square and diamond. With a square, increasing spikes results in a polygon. With a diamond, you get a star.
Hardness
This parameter controls the feathering of the brush border. Value = 1.00 gives a brush with a sharp border (0.00-1.00).
Aspect ratio
This parameter controls the brush Width/Height ratio. A diamond with a 5 pixels radius and an Aspect Ratio = 2, will be flattened with a 10 pixels width and a 5 pixels height (1.0-20.0).
Angle
This angle is the angle between the brush width direction, which is normally horizontal, and the horizontal direction, counter-clock-wise. When this value increases, the brush width turns counter-clock-wise (0° to 180°).
When the brush draws a line, it actually stamps the brush icon repeatedly. If brush stamps are very close, you get the impression of a solid line: you get that with Spacing = 1. (1.00 to 200.0).
