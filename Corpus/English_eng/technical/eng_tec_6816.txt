_Start Benchmarking…
Benchmarking involves measuring the transfer rate on various area of the device as well as measuring how long it takes to seek from one random area to another. Please back up important data before using the write benchmark.
Transfer Rate
Number of S_amples
Sample S_ize (MiB)
Perform _write-benchmark
Benchmarking the write-rate of a disk requires exclusive access to the disk (e.g. the disk or its partitions cannot be mounted or in use) and involves reading data and then writing it back. As a result, the contents of the disk is not changed.

If not checked, the write-part of the benchmark will not be done but on the other hand exclusive access to the device is not needed (e.g. the disk or device can be in use).
Number of samples. Bigger number produces a more accurate picture of access time patterns but takes more time.
The number of MiB (1048576 bytes) to read/write for each sample. Big sample sizes tend to produce more accurate benchmarks at the cost of the benchmark taking more time.
Access Time
Number of Sampl_es
Number of samples. Bigger number produces more smooth graphs but the benchmark will take more time.
