-m find all one level more specific matches
-M find all levels of more specific matches
-c find the smallest match containing a mnt-irt attribute
-x exact match
-b return brief IP address ranges with abuse contact
-B turn off object filtering (show email addresses)
-G turn off grouping of associated objects
-d return DNS reverse delegation objects too
-i ATTR[,ATTR]... do an inverse look-up for specified ATTRibutes
-T TYPE[,TYPE]... only look for objects of TYPE
-K only primary keys are returned
-r turn off recursive look-ups for contact information
-R force to show local copy of the domain object even
