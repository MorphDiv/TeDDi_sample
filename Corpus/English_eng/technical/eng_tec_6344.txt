Keyboard Shortcuts Using shortcuts you can configure certain actions to be triggered when you press a key or a combination of keys, e. g. Ctrl+C is normally bound to'Copy '. KDE allows you to store more than one'scheme' of shortcuts, so you might want to experiment a little setting up your own scheme, although you can still change back to the KDE defaults. In the'Global Shortcuts' tab you can configure non-application-specific bindings, like how to switch desktops or maximize a window; in the'Application Shortcuts' tab you will find bindings typically used in applications, such as copy and paste.

It allows you to use Command+C for Copy, for instance, instead of the PC standard of Ctrl+C. Command will be used for application and console commands, Option as a command modifier and for navigating menus and dialogs, and Control for window manager commands.
