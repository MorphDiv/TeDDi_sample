Inserting Charts
Different methods exist to start a chart:
Insert a chart based on data from cells in Calc or Writer.
These charts update automatically when the source data changes.
Insert a chart with a default data set, and then use the Chart Data Table dialogue box to enter your own data for that chart.
These charts can be created in Writer, Impress and Draw.
Copy a chart from Calc or Writer into another document.
These charts are snapshots of the data at the time of copying.
They do not change when the source data changes.
In Calc, a chart is an object on a sheet, it cannot be a sheet of its own.
