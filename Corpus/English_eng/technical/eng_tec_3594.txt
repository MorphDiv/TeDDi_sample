PHP Manual

(PHP 3, PHP 4)
If the optional base parameter is specified, log() returns log base arg, otherwise log() returns the natural logarithm of arg.
Note:
The base parameter became available with PHP version 4.3.0.
As always you can calculate the logarithm in base b of a number n, but using the mathematical identity: log b (n) = log(n) / log(b), where log is the neperian (or natural) logarithm.
