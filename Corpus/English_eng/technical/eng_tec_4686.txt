(PHP 4)
session_id() returns the session id for the current session.
If id is specified, it will replace the current session id. session_id() needs to be called before session_start() for that purpose.
Depending on the session handler, not all characters are allowed within the session id.
For example, the file session handler only allows characters in the range a-z, A-Z and 0-9!
The constant SID can also be used to retrieve the current name and session id as a string suitable for adding to URLs.
Note that SID is only defined if the client didn 't send the right cookie.
See also Session handling.
See also session_start(), session_set_save_handler(), and session.save_handler.
