msession is an interface to a high speed session daemon which can run either locally or remotely.
It is designed to provide consistent session management for a PHP web farm.
More Information about msession and the session server software itself can be found at http: / /www.mohawksoft.com / phoenix /.
Note:
This extension is not available on Windows platforms.
To enable Msession support configure PHP --with-msession[ =DIR], where DIR is the Msession install directory.
