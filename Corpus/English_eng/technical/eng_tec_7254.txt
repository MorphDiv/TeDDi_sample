Using Invest
Before the applet can provide you with recent quotes, you have to configure it. Quotes can come from different stock exchange centers around the world, so the prices can have different currencies. The automatic translation of currencies can be configured, as well as the translation of your purchases done in different countries. Finally, charts are available for each of your configured quote.

Lets look at this example: You bought one Yahoo! share (YHOO) for 10.00 USD at a currency rate of 0.75 EUR per USD. In other words, the share cost 7.50 EUR.

Chart Options
For each quote in your list, a financial chart is available. To open the financial chart, view the list of configured quotes, and double-click the quote that you wish to chart. The chart parameters can be customized by clicking
Date Range
The date range, in the top-right corner of the window, selects the length of time to report on. By default, it gives one day of data, but the following ranges can be choosen:
Graph Style
Historical price information can be graphed in three different ways. You can select a line chart, bar chart, or candlestick chart.

This is the default option. This graphs the historical price information in a familiar manner, connecting each day's closing price with a single line. Line charts for graphing quotes are useful if an analyst is interested only in a closing price each time.

A bar chart represents a full day's activity with a single vertical bar. The top of the vertical line indicates the highest price a security traded during the day, and the bottom represents the lowest price. The closing price is displayed on the right side of the bar, and the opening price is shown on the left side of the bar. One bar represents one day of trading.

A candlestick chart in which the open and close prices are represented as the top and bottom of a rectangle surrounding a vertical line connecting the high and low prices. The body of the rectangle is filled if the closing price is lower than the opening price and is left blank if the closing price is higher than the opening price.
Moving Average
A moving average is a statistical series of a security's closing prices throughout consecutive trading days. It is typically shown in the same graph as a line chart to indicate trends in prices.
Exponential Moving Average
The exponential moving average (EMA) is defined as a moving average calculated by weighting recent values more heavily than older values. This type of moving average reacts faster to recent price changes than a simple moving average. The 12- and 26-day EMAs are popular short-term averages, while EMAs greater than 50 days are used to signal long-term trends.
Overlays
Overlays allow you to graph multiple statistical measurements onto a single chart. For example, you can compare the performance of a single quote against that of an index such as the NASDAQ or the DJIA.
Indicators
Indicators are used to attempt to predict future financial trends. Proper use of market indicators is beyond the scope of the Invest manual.
