Fully integrated input methods have arrived.
Integrated Input Methods
For the very first time, GNOME comes with support for input methods out of the box. It is no longer necessary to manually choose and install an input method framework that may not fit very well into the overall user experience. Input methods are now a part of the core GNOME user experience, just like keyboard layouts.
Feedback Wanted!
Integrated input methods is a major new feature, and changes functionality that is important to many users. We recognize this and want to hear about how you want the new feature to develop in the future.
If you do not wish to make use of this functionality, or prefer to use another framework to provide you with input methods, this remains possible as

Activities Overview
The Activities Overview has received plenty of attention this release. One change is the way that application launchers are reached. In previous versions, you used the application tab in the top-left to access your applications. This has been replaced with a new grid button that is located in the dash. This greatly improves the layout of the overview and highlights the all-important search bar.

Lock Screen
The lock screen is a major new feature for GNOME 3.6. It shows an attractive image on the screen while your computer is locked and also provides useful functionality, such as the display of notifications and the ability to control media playback.
The lock screen means that you can see what is happening while your computer is locked, and it allows you to get a summary of what has been happening while you have been away. (This functionality can be disabled via the
The login screen has also been updated for GNOME 3.6, and has a new visual style and other minor enhancemets. Combined with the new lock screen, the result is a smoother experience when you log in or unlock your computer.

Major updates make it better looking and easier to use.
Message Tray
The message tray has received some major updates for GNOME 3.6. Many of these changes were based on feedback and testing, which indicated some interaction issues with the old tray design.
The new tray is clearer, better looking, and easier to interact with. It refines the existing design so that it is less error-prone and more satisfying to use. Instead of overlapping the viewing area, the new tray slides the view up, revealing the tray below. The items in the tray are also bigger, clearer, and don't move around, making them easier to use.
The way that the tray is triggered has also been altered. The hot corner ‚Äì which many people had problems with ‚Äì has been replaced. Instead, the whole of the bottom screen edge now acts as a trigger area; letting the mouse rest there for a short period will cause the tray to appear. We plan to improve this behavior in subsequent releases.
For the first time, the message tray is also accessible with the keyboard. Press
Smarter, more noticeable, easier to dismiss.
Notifications
GNOME's notification pop-ups have had quite a few refinements for 3.6. For the new release, we have made them:
Smarter: notifications are smarter in GNOME 3.6. If you are running a full screen application or game, we only show you your important notifications. All other notifications are delayed until you stop using your full screen application.
More noticeable: we have tweaked the behavior of notification pop-ups to make sure that you see all your notifications. No longer will you miss out on a notification as we only hide a notification after we know you have interacted with the system.
Easier to dismiss: notification bubbles now feature close buttons. This makes it much clearer how to dismiss a notification.

Background
We looked at how someone would select a background in 3.4, and noticed a number of issues. It was quite easy to accidentally change the current background, while selecting a new background was quite difficult.
In 3.6, we show the current background as a large thumbnail. When clicked, you can easily select either a background, one of your pictures or a background color. To make your choice easier, we have made the previews bigger.
We have also refreshed the default background in 3.6, and have updated the choice of alternative backgrounds to include new images. Setting a single color as a background has also been improved and features a new set of colors.

User Accounts
A major new feature in GNOME 3.6 is the addition of Enterprise logins (also called Active Directory or Kerberos logins). This allows GNOME to be used in centrally managed and corporate environments in a much more integrated manner. Users can enroll their computer with an enterprise network, and use their enterprise user name and password to log into GNOME.
Network
The network settings panel has been improved to make it easier to select wireless connections. A new list now gives access to all available and remembered wireless networks. You can inspect and forget access points, regardless whether they are currently in range or not.

The Overview
The most noticeable difference in 3.6 is the first version of 'The Overview'. While this is still an evolving design, it already is a solid improvement to the user experience.
The previously blank start page was replaced by a grid that holds your most visited pages. Your favorite pages are now easier to access, especially on touch devices, and valuable screen real estate is used! And if an unwanted page ends up there, you can remove it from the grid by clicking on the

No more worries to activate accessibility!
Accessibility Always On
So far, users that needed any assistive technology had to activate accessibility support. This was cumbersome, because they had to figure out how to do that without the help of any assistive technology that they may need.
Starting with GNOME 3.6, the accessibility stack has been highly integrated into the core, so users that need any assistive technology can use GNOME right from the start.
This feature is an important milestone in GNOME's mission to deliver a free and open desktop to everyone. More than ever, it can be stated that GNOME accessibility is built-in and not bolted-on.
To summarize:
Built-in and always ready accessibility support.
Users don't notice any difference unless they use any Assistive Technology.

GNOME 3.6 brings inverse video, brightness, contrast, and grayscale options to the GNOME magnifier. The combination of these options is very powerful and is particularly useful for people with low-vision, any degree of photophobia, or just for using the computer under adverse lighting conditions.

The high contrast theme has received several improvements this cycle. GNOME's new and refreshed interface components are now supported by high-contrast mode. The high contrast icons that are used in this mode have also been improved and extended, making high contrast look better and cover more of GNOME.
Configure the Zoom to Suit You
New Zoom Settings
New settings for configuring the zoom (or magnifier) feature have been added for this release. The new zoom options allow you to change the magnification factor, the mouse tracking, the position of the magnified view on the screen and enable crosshairs to be added to help you find the mouse or touchpad pointer.
3.4 is the second GNOME release since 3.0 back in April 2011. It brings a large number of improvements to the user experience, including many bug fixes and small enhancements. The result is a shinier, more polished, more reliable GNOME 3.
This release also contains some important new developments. Our applications have been a major focus for recent design and development effort, and a host of applications have had significant updates for this release. You will also see improvements to the building blocks that our applications have been made with. This includes smooth scrolling, refreshed user interface components, a much refined visual theme and application menus.
Other highlights for this release include a new document search facility, a new application called Boxes, video calling, and a new animated background that updates over the course of the day. Enjoy!
Our applications have been a major theme for this release cycle. The new applications that were released in 3.2 have all received major updates that make them better looking and more pleasurable to use. Several existing applications have also received an overhaul so that they are more consistent and integrated with GNOME 3.
