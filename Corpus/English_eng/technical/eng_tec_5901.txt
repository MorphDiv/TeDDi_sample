swap msgid and msgstr fields in a PO file
swappo filename. po
Description
swappo reads the given PO-file and swaps the msgid and msgstr fields for every message. The result is a new PO-file that translates in the opposite direction. For example, if PO-file translates from English to French, the new PO-file will translate from French to English.
The new PO-file will be written to standard output. The old PO-file will remain untouched.
