PHP Manual

(PHP 3 = 3.0.4, PHP 4)
Opens filename and parses it line by line for meta tags in the file.
This can be a local file or an URL.
The parsing stops at / head.
Setting use_include_path to 1 will result in PHP trying to open the file along the standard include path as per the include_path directive.
This is used for local files, not URLs.
Example 1.
What get_meta_tags() parses
meta name=" author "content="name" meta name="keywords "content="php documentation" meta name="DESCRIPTION "content="a php manual" meta name="geo.position "content="49.33;-86.59" / head !- - parsing stops here - -
The value of the name property becomes the key, the value of the content property becomes the value of the returned array, so you can easily use standard array functions to traverse it or access single values.
Special characters in the value of the name property are substituted with '_', the rest is converted to lower case.
If two meta tags have the same name, only the last one is returned.
Example 2.
What get_meta_tags() returns
?php / / Assuming the above tags are at example.com $tags = get_meta_tags( 'http: / /www.example.com / '); / / Notice how the keys are all lowercase now, and / / how. was replaced by _ in the key. print $tags['author']; / / name print $tags['keywords']; / / php documentation print $tags['description']; / / a php manual print $tags['geo_position']; / / 49.33 ;-86.59?
Note:
As of PHP 4.0.5, get_meta_tags() supports unquoted html attributes.
See also htmlentities() and urlencode().
