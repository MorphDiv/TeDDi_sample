General section
This section contains options that affect general & kplayer; behavior.
Resize main window automatically
By default & kplayer; resizes the main window automatically unless it is maximized or full screen. When & kplayer; loads and starts playing a new video, it scales it in increments of 50% of the original video size until the video width reaches the Minimum initial video width setting. It also automatically resizes the window to maintain the video aspect if that option is turned on.
If you would like to avoid automatic resizing and always keep the window the size you make it, turn this option off. & kplayer; will then maintain the video aspect by constraining the video within the window, as if the window was maximized for example. You will also want to turn this option off if you get problems coming back from full screen mode, like endless flickering for example. But in that case you should also report the bug following instructions in Reporting bugs HOWTO.
Minimum initial video width
If Resize main window automatically option is enabled, when & kplayer; loads and starts playing a new video, it scales it in increments of 50% of the original video size until the video width in pixels reaches this setting.
Maximum entries on playlist menus
This option tells & kplayer; the maximum number of entries to put on the Play List submenu of the File menu and right click popup menus and on the Add to submenu of the Library menu and the library popup menu. The multimedia library allows you to create as many playlists as you like, and you can always access them in the Playlists section of the library regardless of this setting.
Maximum entries on Play Recent menu
This option tells & kplayer; the maximum number of entries to put on the Play Recent submenu of the File menu and right click popup menus. When the number of entries is exceeded, & kplayer; will remove the oldest entries from the menu, but depending on the option below you may still find them in the multimedia library.
Maximum Recent entries in the library
This option tells & kplayer; the maximum number of entries to put in the Recent section of the multimedia library. When the number of entries is exceeded, & kplayer; will remove the oldest entries. Note that playing a directory or a selection of files and directories creates only one entry in the Recent section and on the Play Recent menu.
Meta information cache size limit
This option gives the maximum number of multimedia items for which & kplayer; should store the file properties. These items include local files, remote URL s, CD tracks, DVD titles and tuner device channels. & kplayer; remembers the properties of each of those items, and when the total number of items exceeds this setting, it will start discarding the properties of the items that have not been played for the longest time.
Allow duplicate entries on playlists
If this option is selected, & kplayer; will let you add items with identical URL s to the playlist. When the option is turned off and you add new entries to a playlist, & kplayer; will remove any existing entries that have the same URL as one of the new entries from the same playlist folder. Also if some of the new entries have identical URL s, it will add only one for each URL.
Show messages if a file fails to play
This option tells & kplayer; whether to automatically show the message log if & kplayer; encounters an error when trying to play a file. If this option is enabled, & kplayer; will show the log and scroll to the last messages from the first file with an error, so you can see what the error was. If the option is disabled, & kplayer; will instead display the word Error in the left portion of the status bar, and then you can left click it to show the message log.
Controls section
This section contains advanced options that control how your choices made using various & kplayer; controls are applied and stored. For more information on applying options to individual files see the File Properties section of this manual.
Remember for current file any changes made with Shift
If this option is selected, when you adjust one of the settings listed below while holding the & Shift; key down, & kplayer; will apply the change only to the current file, store it in the file properties, and revert to the setting prior to the change before loading another file. You will be able to see and modify the stored setting in the File Properties dialog. The next time the file is played, the setting stored in its properties will again take effect until another file is loaded.
If you make the change without pressing the & Shift; key, and the corresponding option below is not selected, the new setting will apply to the current file and all files played after it until you change the setting again.
Always remember the following settings for each file
The following options let you choose what settings & kplayer; will automatically remember in the file properties for each individual file. By default it stores the video aspect ratio, subtitle delay and audio delay separately for each file, and resets the delays for each new file, while other settings are preserved when loading new files. Normally you should leave the options below at their defaults. Settings for which the corresponding options below are not selected can still be easily stored for each file by holding down the & Shift; key while changing them, as long as the Remember for current file any changes made with Shift option is selected.
Display size
If this option is selected, & kplayer; will automatically remember in the file properties for the currently loaded file the video display size you choose by resizing the main KPlayer window or the video area. As mentioned above, if this option is not selected, you can still make & kplayer; remember the display size by holding down the & Shift; key, but for that to work in this case it is important that you start holding the & Shift; key before resizing.
Display aspect
If this option is selected, & kplayer; will automatically remember in the file properties for the currently loaded file the video aspect you choose by using commands on View menu.
