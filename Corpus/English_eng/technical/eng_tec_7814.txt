CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).
• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.
In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l.
• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent provided.
In order to avoid the injection of large volumes, up to 3 containers of product may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.
2 The dosage recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH.
Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing preparations.
However, when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH, GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions.
It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.
Women with anovulation (including PCOD):
The object of GONAL-f therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG.
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections.
In menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/ or oestrogen secretion.
A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 IU, or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4).
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies:
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
3 Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5 IU-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
GONAL-f must not be used in: • hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • case of tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
and in women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
In men: primary testicular insufficiency
4 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
Acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to what can be obtained with hMG.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia,
5 haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
6 Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
GONAL-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except lutropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use during pregnancy
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotropins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant FSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
7 Use during lactation
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.

5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: gonadotrophins, ATC code:
G03GA05.
GONAL-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.
In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles.
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l as measured in a central laboratory.
However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following intravenous administration, GONAL-f is distributed to the extra cellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day.
The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l/ h, respectively.
One- eighth of the GONAL-f dose is excreted in the urine.
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%.
Following repeated administration, GONAL-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days.
In women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, GONAL-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SPC.
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/ kg/ day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.
9 Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/ kg/ day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hMG.
However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
Acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to what can be obtained with hMG.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia,
15 haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
16 Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
GONAL-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except lutropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use during pregnancy
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotropins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant FSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
Use during lactation
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: gonadotrophins, ATC code:
G03GA05.
GONAL-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.
In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles.
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l as measured in a central laboratory.
However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following intravenous administration, GONAL-f is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day.
The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l/ h, respectively.
One- eighth of the GONAL-f dose is excreted in the urine.
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%.
Following repeated administration, GONAL-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days.
In women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, GONAL-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SPC.
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/ kg/ day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.
Given in high doses (> 5 IU/ kg/ day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hMG.
However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).
• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.
In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l.
• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent provided.
In order to avoid the injection of large volumes, up to 3 vials of product may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.
22 The dosage recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH.
Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing preparations.
However, when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH, GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions.
It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.
Women with anovulation (including PCOD):
The object of GONAL-f therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG.
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections.
In menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/ or oestrogen secretion.
A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4).
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies:
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
23 Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
GONAL-f must not be used in: • hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • case of tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
and in women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
In men: • primary testicular insufficiency
24 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
Acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to what can be obtained with hMG.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia,
25 haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
26 Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use during pregnancy
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotrophins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
Use during lactation
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: gonadotrophins, ATC code:
G03GA05.
GONAL-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.
In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles.
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l as measured in a central laboratory.
However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following intravenous administration, GONAL-f is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day.
The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l/ h, respectively.
One- eighth of the GONAL-f dose is excreted in the urine.
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%.
Following repeated administration, GONAL-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days.
In women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, GONAL-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SPC..
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/ kg/ day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.
Given in high doses (> 5 IU/ kg/ day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hMG.
However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).
• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.
In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l.
• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent provided.
In order to avoid the injection of large volumes, up to 3 vials of product may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.
32 The dosage recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH.
Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing preparations.
However, when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH, GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions.
It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.
Women with anovulation (including PCOD):
The object of GONAL-f therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG.
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections.
In menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/ or oestrogen secretion.
A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4).
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies:
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
33 In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
GONAL-f must not be used in: • hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • case of tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
and in women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
34 In men: • primary testicular insufficiency
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
Acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to what can be obtained with hMG.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
35 The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
36 Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use during pregnancy
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotrophins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
Use during lactation
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
37 No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent provided.
In order to avoid the injection of large volumes, GONAL-f 37.5 IU (2.8 micrograms) may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent and combined with GONAL-f 75 IU (5.5 micrograms) and/ or GONAL-f 150 IU (11 micrograms).
Up to three vials of product may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent.

A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
43 Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
GONAL-f must not be used in: • hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • case of tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland and in women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
In men: • primary testicular insufficiency
44 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
Acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to what can be obtained with hMG.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia,
45 haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
46 Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use during pregnancy
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotrophins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
Use during lactation
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
47 4.8 Undesirable effects
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: gonadotrophins, ATC code:
G03GA05.
GONAL-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.
In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles.
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l as measured in a central laboratory.
However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following intravenous administration, GONAL-f is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day.
The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l/ h, respectively.
One- eighth of the GONAL-f dose is excreted in the urine.
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%.
Following repeated administration, GONAL-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days.
In women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, GONAL-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SPC.
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/ kg/ day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.
Given in high doses (> 5 IU/ kg/ day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hMG.
However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).
• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.
In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l.
• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The powder should be reconstituted prior to the first use with the solvent provided.
GONAL-f 1050 IU/ 1.75 ml (77 micrograms/ 1.75 ml) preparation must not be reconstituted with any other GONAL-f container.
52 The dosage recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH.
Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing preparations.
However, when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH, GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions.
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.
It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.
Women with anovulation (including PCOD):
The object of GONAL-f therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG.
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections.
In menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/ or oestrogen secretion.
A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4).
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies:
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
53 Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
GONAL-f must not be used in: • hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • case of tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
and in women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
In men: • primary testicular insufficiency
54 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.
During training of the patient for self- administration, special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the multidose presentation.
As GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.
Due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
Acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to what can be obtained with hMG.
55 Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
56 Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
GONAL-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use during pregnancy
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotrophins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
57 Use during lactation
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: gonadotrophins, ATC code:
G03GA05.
GONAL-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.
In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles.
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l as measured in a central laboratory.
However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following intravenous administration, GONAL-f is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day.
The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l/ h, respectively.
One- eighth of the GONAL-f dose is excreted in the urine.
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%.
Following repeated administration, GONAL-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days.
In women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, GONAL-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SPC.
59 In rabbits, the formulation reconstituted with 0.9% benzyl alcohol and 0.9% benzyl alcohol alone, both resulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild inflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively.
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/ kg/ day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.
Given in high doses (> 5 IU/ kg/ day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hMG.
However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).
• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.
In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l.
• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The powder should be reconstituted prior to the first use with the solvent provided.
GONAL-f 450 IU/ 0.75 ml (33 micrograms/ 0.75 ml) preparation must not be reconstituted with any other GONAL-f containers.
62 The dosage recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH.
Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing preparations.
However, when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH, GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions.
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.
It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.
Women with anovulation (including PCOD):
The object of GONAL-f therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG.
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections.
In menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/ or oestrogen secretion.
A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4).
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies:
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
63 In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
GONAL-f must not be used in: • hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • case of tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
and in women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
In men: • primary testicular insufficiency
64 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.
During training of the patient for self- administration, special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the multidose presentation.
As GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.
Due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
Acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to what can be obtained with hMG.
65 Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
66 Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
GONAL-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use during pregnancy
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotrophins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
67 Use during lactation

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).
• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.
In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l.
• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The powder should be reconstituted prior to the first use with the solvent provided.
GONAL-f 300 IU/ 0.50 ml (22 micrograms/ 0.50 ml) preparation must not be reconstituted with any other GONAL-f containers.
72 The dosage recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH.
Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing preparations.
However, when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH, GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions.
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.
It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.
Women with anovulation (including PCOD):
The object of GONAL-f therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG.
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections.
In menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/ or oestrogen secretion.
A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4).
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies:
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
73 In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
GONAL-f must not be used in: • hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • case of tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
and in women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
In men: • primary testicular insufficiency
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
74 GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice.
During training of the patient for self- administration, special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the multidose presentation.
As GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.
Due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
Acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation require a physician whom is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to what can be obtained with hMG.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high
75 serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
76 Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumors in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment in assessing the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
GONAL-f should not be administered as mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use during pregnancy
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotrophins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
Use during lactation
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.
77 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.

5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: gonadotrophins, ATC code:
G03GA05.
GONAL-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.
In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles.
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l as measured in a central laboratory.
However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following intravenous administration, GONAL-f is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day.
The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l/ h, respectively.
One- eighth of the GONAL-f dose is excreted in the urine.
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%.
Following repeated administration, GONAL-f accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days.
In women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, GONAL-f has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SPC.
79 In rabbits, the formulation reconstituted with 0.9% benzyl alcohol and 0.9% benzyl alcohol alone, both resulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild inflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively.
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/ kg/ day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/ kg/ day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hMG.
However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The dosage recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH.
Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing
82 preparations.
However, when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH, GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions.
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.
It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.
Women with anovulation (including PCOD):
The object of GONAL-f therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG.
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections.
In menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.

A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4).
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies:
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the
83 oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • Tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
In women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
Must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
In men: • primary testicular insufficiency
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
84 Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.
During training of the patient for self- administration, special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the prefilled pen.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or for ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to the recommended GONAL-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
85 Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
86 Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumours in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotrophins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
87 4.8 Undesirable effects

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: gonadotrophins, ATC code:
G03GA05.
GONAL-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.
In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles.
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l as measured in a central laboratory.
However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day.
The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l/ h, respectively.
One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%.
Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days.
In women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SPC.
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/ kg/ day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/ kg/ day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hMG.
However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).
• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.
In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l.
• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The dosage recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH.
Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing
91 preparations.
However, when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH, GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions.
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.
It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.
Women with anovulation (including PCOD):
The object of GONAL-f therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG.
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections.
In menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/ or oestrogen secretion.
A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4).
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies:
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the
92 oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • Tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
In women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
Must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
In men: • primary testicular insufficiency
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
93 Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of Gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of Gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.
During training of the patient for self- administration, special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the prefilled pen.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or for ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to the recommended Gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
94 Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
Reproductive system neoplasms
95 There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumours in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotrophins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
97 Pharmacotherapeutic group: gonadotrophins, ATC code:
G03GA05.
GONAL-f is a preparation of follicle stimulating hormone produced by genetically engineered Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.
In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles.
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l as measured in a central laboratory.
However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.
In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day.
The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10 l and 0.6 l/ h, respectively.
One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%.
Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3-4 days.
In women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SPC.
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/ kg/ day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/ kg/ day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary hMG.
However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
• Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
• Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).
• GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.
In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ l.
• GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems.
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous administration.
The dosage recommendations given for GONAL-f are those in use for urinary FSH.
Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment
100 monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing preparations.
However, when these doses were used in a clinical study comparing GONAL-f and urinary FSH, GONAL-f was more effective than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to achieve pre-ovulatory conditions.
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.
It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.
Women with anovulation (including PCOD):
The object of GONAL-f therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG.
GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections.
In menstruating patients treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/ or oestrogen secretion.
A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4).
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies:
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.
Down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH.
In a commonly used protocol, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter.
Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency:
101 In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG).
GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa.
Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.
Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’ s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response.
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments.
It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections.
The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/ hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld.
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle.
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:
GONAL-f should be given at a dosage of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months.
If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.
4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients • Tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
In women: • ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology • ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma
Must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:
In women: • primary ovarian failure • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
In men: • primary testicular insufficiency
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
102 GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.
Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities.
In women, safe and effective use of Gonal-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis.
There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients.
The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.
Self-administration of Gonal-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.
During training of the patient for self- administration, special attention should be given to specific instructions for the use of the prefilled pen.
The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision.
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f.
Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
Treatment in women
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or for ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation.
Adherence to the recommended Gonal-f dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events.
For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa.
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments.
No direct comparison of GONAL-f/ LH versus human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) has been performed.
Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/ LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)
OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement.
OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity.
It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia,
103 haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events.
Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.
Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation.
Therefore in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.
To minimise the risk of OHSS or of multiple pregnancy, ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended.
In anovulation the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy is increased by a serum oestradiol > 900 pg/ ml (3300 pmol/ l) and more than 3 follicles of 14 mm or more in diameter.
In ART there is an increased risk of OHSS with a serum oestradiol > 3000 pg/ ml (11000 pmol/ l) and 20 or more follicles of 12 mm or more in diameter.
When the oestradiol level is > 5500 pg/ ml (20200 pmol/ l) and where there are 40 or more follicles in total, it may be necessary to withhold hCG administration.
Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.
OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs.
Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment.
Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses.
If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started.
This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease.
Multiple pregnancy
Multiple pregnancy, specially high order, carries an increase risk in adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
In patients undergoing ovulation induction with GONAL-f, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased as compared with natural conception.
The majority of multiple conceptions are twins.
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.
Pregnancy wastage
The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than in the normal population.
Ectopic pregnancy
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments.
The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF was reported to be 2 to 5%, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population.
104 Reproductive system neoplasms
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment.
It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumours in infertile women.
Congenital malformation
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions.
This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e. g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.
Thromboembolic events
In women with generally recognised risk factors for thrombo-embolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk.
In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks.
It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events.
Treatment in men
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure.
Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/ hCG therapy.
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other agents used to stimulate ovulation (e. g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dosage of Gonal-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response.
No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during Gonal-f therapy.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy.
No teratogenic risk has been reported, following controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with gonadotrophins.
In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of recombinant hFSH.
However, to date, no particular malformative effect has been reported.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
GONAL-f is not indicated during lactation.
During lactation, the secretion of prolactin can entail a poor prognosis to ovarian stimulation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Further information
1.
WHAT GONAL-f IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
GONAL-f is a medicinal product containing follitropin alfa, which is made in laboratories by special recombinant DNA techniques.
It belongs to the family of hormones called gonadotrophins, which are involved in the normal control of reproduction.
Therapeutic indications
The medicinal product should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician.
• In women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate, GONAL-f can be used to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used to bring about the development of several follicles (and therefore several eggs) for women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation, gamete intra-fallopian transfer or zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
• In women who are not ovulating due to very low production of the fertility hormones (FSH and LH) by their pituitary gland, GONAL-f is used together with another hormone called lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinising hormone) to cause ovulation.
• GONAL-f is used in combination with another medicine, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), to produce sperm in men, who are infertile due to hormonal deficiency.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE GONAL-f
You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started.
161 Do not use GONAL-f
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of GONAL-f. • if you have tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland
If you are a woman:
• ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease • gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause • ovarian, uterine or breast cancer
The medicine should not be used when a condition exists which would make a normal pregnancy impossible, such as premature menopause, malformation of sexual organs or specific tumours of the womb.
If you are a man:
• GONAL-f should not be given to men with irreversible testicular damage.
In addition, no studies on the effects on ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Take special care with GONAL-f
If you have porphyria or a family history of porphyria (a disorder that may be passed on from parents to children), you should inform your doctor as the use of certain medications may trigger an attack of the illness.
If you notice your skin becoming fragile and easily blistered (especially areas that are frequently exposed to sunlight) and/ or you have stomach or limb pain you should tell your doctor who may recommend that you stop treatment.
If you are a woman, this treatment increases your risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see section 4).
However, if you are not ovulating and the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is uncommon.
GONAL-f treatment in either indication seldom gives rise to significant OHSS unless the medicine used to induce final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotrophin - hCG) is administered.
It is therefore prudent to withhold administration of hCG in cases where OHSS is developing and not to have sexual intercourse or use barrier methods for at least four days.
The risk of multiple pregnancy following assisted reproductive technologies is related to the number of oocytes/ embryos replaced.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.
However, this can be minimised by using the recommended dose and schedule of administration.
Miscarriages are higher than in the normal population, but comparable with the rates found in women with fertility problems.
There have been isolated reports of non-serious allergic reactions to GONAL-f.
If you had this type of reaction to similar medicines, inform your doctor.
If you are a man, elevated follicle stimulating hormone blood levels are indicative of testicular damage.
GONAL-f is usually not effective in such cases.
To monitor the treatment, your doctor may ask you for a semen analysis to be performed 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment.
Using other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
162 GONAL-f should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products in the same injection, except for lutropin alfa.
Studies have shown that these two medicines can be mixed and injected together, without either product being adversely affected.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
GONAL-f is not indicated if you are pregnant or are breast-feeding.
Important information about some of the ingredients of GONAL-f
GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium-free”.
3.
HOW TO USE GONAL-f
Always take GONAL-f exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Women who are not ovulating and are having irregular periods or no periods at all.
GONAL-f is usually given every day.
If you have periods, the treatment should start within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.
A commonly used dose starts at 75-150 IU FSH every day.
This may be increased by 37.5 IU-75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.
The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH.
If your doctor cannot see a response after 4 weeks of treatment, that treatment cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle.
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of another medicine (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of the administration of this second medicine and the following day.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see Section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe a dosage lower than that of the previous cycle.
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies.
A commonly used dose for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the treatment cycle.
Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by blood monitoring and/ or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to your response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily.
Adequate follicular development is usually achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days).
Then a single injection of a medicine used to induce final follicular maturation and containing up to 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is administered 24-48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection.
In other cases, down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is used.
In these cases, GONAL-f is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved.
For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU GONAL-f are administered for the first 7 days.
The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response.
163 Women who are not ovulating, having no periods at all and have been diagnosed as FSH and LH deficient.
Your doctor will decide on the dose and schedule of administration which are most appropriate for you during this course of treatment.
GONAL-f is usually taken every day for up to three weeks simultaneously with injections of lutropin alfa.
A commonly used dose starts with 75-150 IU of GONAL-f together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
According to your response, your doctor may increase your dose of GONAL-f by preferably 37.5-75 IU at 7 to 14-day intervals.
If your doctor does not observe a response of your ovaries after 3 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned.
For the following cycle, your doctor may prescribe treatment at a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than in the abandoned cycle.
When the desired response has been obtained, a single injection of hCG is given 24-48 hours after the last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa.
You are recommended to have sexual intercourse on the day of, and the day following, administration of the hCG.
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed.
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4).
For the following cycle, your doctor will prescribe GONAL-f at as lower dose than that of the previous cycle.
Infertile men with hormonal deficiency.
GONAL-f is usually prescribed at a dose of 150 IU three times a week in combination with another medicine (hCG) for at least 4 months.
If you have not responded to treatment after this period, your treatment may carry on for at least 18 months.
Route of administration
GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use, that means given by injection just under the skin.
It is for single use only.
If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions:
• Wash your hands.
It is important that your hands and the items you use be as clean as possible.
• Assemble and lay out on a clean surface everything you need:
- - - - - -
one ampoule containing GONAL-f powder one solvent ampoule two alcohol swabs one syringe one needle for reconstitution and a fine bore needle for subcutaneous injection sharp container
• Open the ampoule of solvent (clear liquid):
On the head of the solvent ampoule, you will see a
164 small coloured dot.
Directly below it is where the neck of the ampoule has been treated to make it easier to break.
Gently flick the top section of the ampoule so that any fluid in the neck of the ampoule drops into the bottom chamber.
Now press the ampoule firmly over the neck, and break the ampoule away from the coloured dot.
Carefully place the open ampoule upright on the work surface.
• Draw up the solvent:
Attach the needle for reconstitution to the syringe, with the syringe in one hand, pick up the open ampoule, insert the needle and draw up all of the solvent.
Carefully set the syringe down on the work surface, taking care not to touch the needle.
• Open and prepare the injection solution:
Open the ampoule containing the GONAL-f powder, pick up your syringe and slowly inject the solvent into the ampoule of powder.
After the powder has dissolved (which usually occurs immediately), gently draw the solution back into the syringe.
(If you have been prescribed more than one ampoule of GONAL-f, slowly re-inject the solution into another powder ampoule, until you have the prescribed number of powder ampoules dissolved in the solution.
If you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to GONAL-f, you may also mix the two medicines as an alternative to injecting each product separately.
After dissolving the lutropin alfa powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the ampoule containing GONAL-f.
Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe.
Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear.
Up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in the content of one ampoule of solvent.)
• Change the needle for the fine bore needle and remove any air bubbles:
If you see air bubbles in the syringe, hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards and gently flick the syringe until all the air collects at the top.
Push the plunger until the air bubbles are gone.
• Immediately inject the solution:
Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e. g. tummy, front of thigh).
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab.
Firmly pinch the
165 skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
Inject under the skin, as you were taught.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Inject the solution by pushing gently on the plunger.
Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
• Dispose of all used items:
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard all needles and empty ampoules in the sharp container provided.
Any unused solution must be discarded.
If you use more GONAL-f than you should
The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur, which is further described in section 4.
However this will only occur if hCG is administered (see section 2).
If you forget to take GONAL-f
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose, please contact your doctor.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, GONAL-f can cause side effects, although not every body gets them.
Side effects in women The most commonly reported side effects are ovarian cysts, headache and local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation).
Following treatment with GONAL-f when human chorionic gonadotrophin is administered, a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (see section 2) can occur.
This syndrome is characterised by large ovarian cysts.
First symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation are pain in the lower abdominal region, possibly in combination with nausea, vomiting and weight gain.
Should the above mentioned symptoms occur, a careful medical examination is indicated as soon as possible.
In serious, but rare cases, an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with clearly enlarged ovaries, can go hand in hand with possible accumulation of fluid in the abdomen or thorax as well as more serious thromboembolic complications.
In rare cases the latter can also be found independently of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
In view of the above, to prevent such events, when the ovarian response is excessive, treatment with GONAL-f could be discontinued by your physician and the treatment with hCG abandoned.
Rarely abnormal blood clottings (blood clots in blood vessels) have been seen to occur with similar medicines, so this could possibly occur with GONAL-f / hCG therapy or GONAL-f / lutropin alfa / hCG therapy.
Very rare cases of allergic reactions to GONAL-f have occurred causing redness of the skin, rash, swelling, hives and difficulty in breathing.
These reactions can sometimes be serious.
Very rarely patients with asthma may experience worsening of their condition.
166 Ectopic pregnancy (embryo implanted outside the womb) may occur especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.
Side effects in men Men may experience some breast development, acne or weight gain due to treatment with hCG.
Some men undergoing treatment with GONAL-f may experience local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/ or irritation) or may develop a varicocele (swelling of the veins above and behind the testicle).
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
