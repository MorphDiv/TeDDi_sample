EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
CERVARIX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Cervarix?
Cervarix is a vaccine.
It is a suspension for injection that contains purified ‘ L1 proteins ’ for two types of the human papillomavirus (types 16 and 18).
It is available in a vial or in a prefilled syringe.
What is Cervarix used for?
Cervarix is used to protect against precancerous lesions (abnormal cell growth) in the cervix and cancer of the cervix that are caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 or 18.
This use is based on demonstration of the effectiveness of Cervarix in women aged 15 to 25 years, and of its immunogenicity (its ability to make the immune system respond to the vaccine) in girls and women aged 10 to 25 years.
Cervarix is given according to official recommendations.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Cervarix used?
Cervarix is given to individuals aged 10 years or older, as three doses, with one month between the first and second doses, and five months between the second and third doses.
It is recommended that individuals who receive the first dose of Cervarix should complete all three doses with Cervarix.
The vaccine is given as an injection into the muscle of the upper arm.
Cervarix is not recommended for use in girls aged below 10 years, due to a lack of information on safety and immunogenicity in this group.
How does Cervarix work?
Papillomaviruses are viruses that cause warts and abnormal tissue growth.
There are more than 100 types of papillomavirus, some of which are associated with genital cancers.
HPV types 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of cervical cancers.
All papillomaviruses have a shell or ‘ capsid’, which is made up of proteins called ‘ L1 proteins’.
Cervarix contains purified L1 proteins for two of the types of HPV: types 16 and 18.
The proteins in Cervarix are produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: they are made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA) that makes it able to produce the L1 proteins.
The proteins are assembled in ‘ virus-like particles’ (structures that look like HPV, so that the body can recognise them

The vaccine is made using an ‘ adjuvant system ’ that contains MPL, a purified lipid (a fat-like substance) extracted from bacteria, which acts as an immunostimulant: it enhances the response of the immune system (the system that fights diseases) to the vaccine.
The vaccine is ‘ adsorbed’, which means that the L1 protein virus-like particles and the MPL are fixed onto an aluminium compound, to stimulate a better immune response.
When a patient is given the vaccine, the immune system makes antibodies against the L1 proteins.
The antibodies help to destroy the virus.
After vaccination, the immune system is able to produce antibodies more quickly when it is exposed to the viruses.
This will help to protect against the diseases caused by these viruses.
How has Cervarix been studied?
The effects of Cervarix were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The main study involved almost 19,000 women aged between 15 and 25 years.
Cervarix was compared to another vaccine, which is not active against HPV (in this case, a vaccine against hepatitis A virus).
The study looked at how many women who were originally uninfected with HPV types 16 and 18 went on to develop precancerous lesions in the cervix linked to infection with these types of HPV.
The study was still ongoing at the time of the assessment and will continue for up to four years.
An additional two studies also looked at the development of antibodies to HPV types 16 and 18 in 2,225 girls aged between 10 and 14 years.
The studies compared the levels of antibodies between before vaccination and after the third dose (at month seven).
What benefit has Cervarix shown during the studies?
Cervarix was more effective than the comparator vaccine in preventing abnormal cell growth in the cervix.
In the main study, after an average of 15 months, two of the almost 8,000 women receiving at least one dose of Cervarix and who had not been infected with HPV types 16 or 18 before, developed precancerous lesions in cervix linked to these HPV types.
This compared with 21 of the almost 8,000 women receiving the other vaccine.
The additional studies showed that all of the girls aged 10 to 14 years who were given Cervarix developed protective levels of antibodies against HPV types 16 and 18.
This indicated that the vaccine is likely to be effective in preventing HPV infection in girls from the age of 10 years.
What is the risk associated with Cervarix?
The most common side effects with Cervarix (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are headache, myalgia (muscle pain), reactions at the site of injection including pain, redness and swelling, and fatigue (tiredness).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Cervarix, see the Package Leaflet.
Cervarix should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substance or any of the other ingredients.
Vaccination should be postponed in patients who are ill with a high fever.
Why has Cervarix been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Cervarix’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the prevention of premalignant cervical lesions and cervical cancer causally related to HPV types 16 and 18.
The Committee recommended that Cervarix be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Cervarix:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Cervarix to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s. a. on 20 September 2007.
