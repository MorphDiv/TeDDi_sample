(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Defines a named constant.
See the section on constants for more details.
The name of the constant is given by name; the value is given by value.
The optional third parameter case_insensitive is also available.
If the value TRUE is given, then the constant will be defined case-insensitive.
The default behaviour is case-sensitive; i.e.
CONSTANT and Constant represent different values.
Example 1.
Defining Constants
?php define ("CONSTANT", "Hello world ."); echo CONSTANT; / / outputs "Hello world. "echo Constant; / / outputs "Constant" and issues a notice. define ("GREETING", "Hello you .",TRUE); echo GREETING; / / outputs "Hello you. "echo Greeting; / / outputs "Hello you."?
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
See also defined(), constant() and the section on Constants.
