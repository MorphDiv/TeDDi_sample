& akregator; is a program to read RSS and other online news feeds.
KDE
Akregator
Introduction
What is & akregator;?
& akregator; is a & kde; application for reading online news feeds. It has a powerful, user-friendly interface for reading feeds and the management of them.
& akregator; is a lightweight and fast program for displaying news items provided by feeds, supporting all commonly-used versions of RSS and Atom feeds. Its interface is similar to those of e-mail programs, thus hopefully being very familiar to the user. Useful features include searching within article titles, management of feeds in folders and setting archiving preferences. Feeds can be displayed in a similar manner to e-mails. Websites related to a feed can be shown in & akregator; 's embedded browser or, at the users' choice, opened in an external browser.
RSS and Atom feeds
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an & XML; -based format used for publishing news or articles in a machine-readable form. An RSS or Atom file is also called a feed. A program that can be used to read such feeds is called a feed reader or aggregator, hence the title of the application, & akregator;.
& akregator; automatically extracts new items from the feed and displays them in a human-friendly form to the user. The user can therefore save time with regularly-visited websites, as they need no longer manually check whether there are new pieces of information available.
RSS is available in different versions which are not compatible with each other (this situation caused by competing companies): RSS 0.9, RSS 1.0 and RSS 2.0. Atom is also an & XML; -based feed language which has been redesigned to fit the needs of webloggers and news sites. Atom attempts to replace RSS feeds and remove the uncertainty with incompatiblities in the different RSS versions.
Quick Start to & akregator;
This section describes how to start using & akregator;. It explains the user interface and shows you how to add your own feed to the list. This section is particularily interesting if you are not yet familiar with the general RSS / Atom and feed aggregator concept.
The Main Window
When you first start & akregator;, you see its main window:
akregator; main window
akregator; main window
The main window consists of the feed list, the article list and the article viewer.
The feed list is on the left. In the tree, you have news feeds you can select. A news feed is a collection of articles: for example, the recent news of a news site or the new entries of a blog. The default list contains feeds related to the & kde; project, but of course you can add your own feeds and remove the ones you are not interested in.
All articles are fetched
All articles are fetched
In the upper right is the article list. It contains all the articles of the feed selected in the feed list (if it is empty, you must first fetch the feed). The list shows the headlines of the articles and the date when they were published. By default, the newest articles are at the top.
The article list
The article list for one feed
If you select an article, it will be displayed in the article viewer in the lower right of the window. Depending on the feed, it contains either only a headline, a short summary, or the complete article content.

Adding a feed
& akregator; provides you with some default feeds related to & kde; - of course, you probably want to add your own feeds. Good candidates are the news sites you visit regularly.
Go to the menu Feed and choose Add Feed... or use the default keyboard shortcut (Insert). The following dialog appears, with an input line labeled Feed URL:.
Add a new feed
Add a new feed
Enter www. slashdot. org or http: / /www. slashdot. org in the line edit next to Feed URL and click OK.
The feed settings dialog appears and you can modify the default options. When you are happy with the feed settings, click OK again.
The feed properties dialog
The feed properties dialog
Now Slashdot has been added to your feed list.
There are multiple other ways to find and add interesting feeds. Within & kde;, websites browsed with & konqueror; will display the recognizable & quot; RSS lozengequot; in the bottom-right if a compatible news feed is detected at the website. Just left-click on the icon and choose Add Feed to & akregator;: Automatically finding feeds through & konqueror; Automatically finding feeds through & konqueror; On pages with this RSS icon, right-click on the icon and choose in the context menu Add Feed to & akregator;:
Automatically finding feeds through & konqueror;

Creating a Folder
After adding your own feeds, you may want to group them in some way, rather than just leave them unsorted. So let us create a folder for the Slashdot feed we just added:
Select the parent folder of the new folder. In this example, we select All Feeds.
Open Feed New Folder.... Enter News (or a more appropriate name for the feed category) in the line edit and choose OK.
The New Folder dialog
The New Folder dialog
Now you can drag the Slashdot feed to the new folder.

Browsing inside of & akregator;
When reading feed articles, often you may want to read the web page that belongs to the article: some articles only contain the headline, and not the actual content. In this case, you need to visit the web page to read the complete article. Or perhaps an article links to some website, or you are reading a blog and want to comment on an entry. For these situations, & akregator; contains a simple web browser. Whenever you follow a link in the article viewer, by default & akregator; opens the link in new tab.
Note that the browser in & akregator; is not intended to replace your favorite Web Browser. It is meant for reading articles, commenting on them, or following up a link quickly. It is not meant for browsing the web in general. It lacks many features fully-fledged web browsers offer.
Configuring & akregator;
Most of & akregator; 's options are listed in the & akregator; configuration dialog. The configuration dialog can be found in the menu under Settings Configure & akregator;...
General
The General tab contains the basic and otherwise-uncategorizable options of & akregator;.
The General tab
The General tab
Global
Show tray icon
Display the & akregator; icon in the systray.
Use notifications for all feeds
Set global notifications for all feeds. This setting will override the individual notification value of each feed. When enabled, & akregator; will notify you of all new articles fetched in any feed. If you only want to enable notifications for some (but not all) feeds, leave this option disabled and enable notifications for the each specific feed using the individual feed properties dialog.
Use interval fetching
If this is unchecked, interval checking is disabled. However, if this is checked, you can set in Fetch feeds every: the interval that & akregator; will automatically check for new feed entries. Note that fetching articles generates traffic and therefore may be costly to the provider hosting the feed you're reading. Some sites may even block connections from your computer if you attempt to fetch the feed too often. In general, 30 minutes is a good choice.
Fetch feeds every:
This is enabled when Use interval fetching is checked. You can specify a time interval, after which feeds are checked for new articles. Default is 30 minutes.
Startup
Mark all feeds as read on startup
When enabled, & akregator; marks all articles as read when started.
Fetch all feeds on startup
When enabled, & akregator; fetches all feeds right after start.
Network
Use the browser cache (less network traffic)
When enabled, the & kde; -wide browser cache settings are used when updating feeds. You can configure the & kde; -wide browser cache either in & kcontrolcenter; or in & konqueror; configuration dialog.
You should leave this option enabled whenever possible. Disabling this option leads to increased network traffic. The traffic caused by aggregators not using caching increases the costs for providers and may decrease the number of feeds are offered in future.
Archive
Archiving articles means storing the links of articles. Here you can limit the number of articles stored and the method used for archiving. These settings are global settings, used by all feeds within & akregator;. If you want to use a custom setting for a feed, you can set it in each feed properties dialog in the archive tab.
The Archive tab
The Archive tab
Default Archive Settings
Keep all articles
All articles are kept forever.
Limit feed archive size to:
If the number of articles exceeds the chosen limit, the oldest articles are deleted. Note that flagged articles are ignored when counting the number of articles: if your limit is 500, and you have 510 unflagged and 50 flagged articles, & akregator; will ignore the 50 flagged ones and only delete the 10 oldest unflagged articles. So in this example, 550 articles would be kept.
Delete articles older than:
Articles older than the specified number of days are deleted from the archive, unless they have the keep flag set. & akregator; checks for expired articles at startup and then once per hour, so expiry may be delayed.
Disable archiving
No articles are stored - all articles are discarded when quitting & akregator;.
Do not expire important articles
Right clicking on an article opens a context menu where you can mark this article as Important. Articles marked as Important will not expire, they will be kept.
Appearance
