Combining Objects and Constructing Shapes
Combined drawing objects act as grouped objects, except that you cannot enter the group to edit the individual objects.
You can only combine 2-D objects.
To combine 2-D objects:
Select two or more 2-D objects.
Modify - Combine
.
Unlike groups, a combined object takes on the properties of the lowermost object in the stacking order.
You can split apart combined objects, but the original object properties are lost.
When you combine objects, holes appear where the objects overlap.
Illustration for combining objects
In the illustration, the uncombined objects are on the left and the combined objects on the right.
Constructing Shapes
Shapes
- Merge, Subtract and Intersect
commands to two or more drawing objects.
Shape commands only work on 2-D objects.
Constructed shapes take on the properties of the lowermost object in the stacking order.
To construct a shape:
Select two or more 2-D objects.
Modify - Shapes
and one of the following:
Merge
Subtract
Intersect
.
Shape Commands
In the following illustrations, the original objects are on the left and the modified shapes on the right.
Shapes - Merge
Illustration for merging shapes
Adds the area of the selected objects to the area of the lowermost object in the stacking order.
Shapes - Subtract
Illustration for subtracting shapes
Subtracts the area of the selected objects from the area of the lowermost object in the stacking order.
Shapes - Intersect
Illustration for intersecting shapes
The overlapping area of the selected objects creates the new shape.
The area outside the overlap is removed.
