4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs.
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
• •
For the prevention of vomiting including that induced by chemotherapy.
For the treatment of vomiting, in conjunction with Cerenia Solution For Injection and in combination with other supportive measures.
•
For the prevention of vomiting induced by motion sickness.
4.3 Contraindications
None.
4.4 Special warnings
Vomiting can be associated with serious, severely debilitating conditions including gastrointestinal obstructions; therefore, appropriate diagnostic evaluations should be employed.
Cerenia tablets have been shown to be effective in the treatment of emesis, however where the frequency of vomiting is high, orally administered Cerenia may not be absorbed before the next vomiting event occurs.
It is therefore recommended to initiate the treatment of emesis with Cerenia Solution for Injection.
2 Good veterinary practice indicates that antiemetics should be used in conjunction with other veterinary and supportive measures, such as dietary control and fluid replacement therapy while addressing the underlying causes of the vomiting.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established in dogs less than 16 weeks of age and in pregnant or lactating bitches.
Use only according to the benefit/risk assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
Maropitant is metabolised in the liver and therefore should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease.
Cerenia should be used with caution in animals suffering from or with predisposition for cardiac diseases as maropitant has affinity to Ca- and K-ion channels.
Increases of approximately 10% in the QT interval of the ECG were observed in a study on healthy beagle dogs administered 8 mg/kg orally; however, such an increase is unlikely to be of clinical significance.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Wash hands after use.
In case of accidental ingestion seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Incidents of pre-travel vomiting, usually within two hours post-dosing were commonly reported after administration of the 8 mg/kg dose.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Use only according to the benefit/risk assessment by the responsible veterinarian, because conclusive reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted in any animal species.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Cerenia should not be used concomitantly with Ca-channel antagonists as maropitant has affinity to Ca-channels.
Maropitant is highly bound to plasma proteins and may compete with other highly bound drugs.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For oral use.
For motion sickness a light meal or snack before dosing is recommended; prolonged fasting before administration should be avoided.
However, Cerenia tablets should not be administered wrapped or encapsulated in food as this may delay dissolution of the tablet and consequently the onset of efficacy.
Dogs should be carefully observed following administration to ensure that each tablet is swallowed.
3 For the Treatment and Prevention of Vomiting (except Motion Sickness)
To treat or prevent vomiting, Cerenia tablets should be administered once daily, at a dose of 2 mg maropitant per kg bodyweight, using the number of tablets given in the table below.
Tablets are breakable along the score line on the tablet.
To prevent vomiting, tablets should be given more than 1 hour in advance.
The duration of the effect is approximately 24 hours and, therefore, tablets can be given the night before administration of an agent that may cause emesis (e.g. chemotherapy).
Cerenia can be used to treat or prevent vomiting either as tablets or as solution for injection once daily for up to five days.

For Prevention of Vomiting induced by Motion Sickness
To prevent vomiting induced by motion sickness, Cerenia tablets should be administered once daily, at a dose of 8 mg maropitant per kg bodyweight, using the numbers of tablets given in the table below.
Tablets are breakable along the score line on the tablet.
Tablets should be administered at least one hour before starting the journey.
The anti-emetic effect persists for at least 12 hours, which for convenience may allow administration the night before early morning travel.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antiemetics and Antinauseants, ATCvet code:
QA04AD90
Maropitant is a potent and selective neurokinin (NK-1) receptor antagonist, which acts by inhibiting the binding of substance P, a neuropeptide of the tachykinin family, in the CNS.
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Vomiting is a complex process coordinated centrally by the emetic centre.
This centre consists of several brainstem nuclei (area postrema, nucleus tractus solitarius, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus) that receive and integrate sensory stimuli from central and peripheral sources and chemical stimuli from the circulation and the cerebro-spinal fluid.
Maropitant is a neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, which acts by inhibiting the binding of substance P, a neuropeptide of the tachykinin family.
Substance P is found in significant concentrations in the nuclei comprising the emetic centre and is considered the key neurotransmitter involved in vomiting.
By inhibiting the binding of substance P within the emetic centre, maropitant is effective against neural and humoral (central and peripheral) causes of vomiting.
A variety of in vitro assays have demonstrated that maropitant binds selectively at the NK1 receptor with dose-dependent functional antagonism of substance P activity.
In vivo studies in dogs demonstrated the anti-emetic efficacy of maropitant against central and peripheral emetics including apomorphine, cisplatin and syrup of ipecac.
Maropitant is non-sedative and should not be used as a sedative in motion sickness.
Maropitant is effective against vomiting.
Signs of nausea including excessive salivation and lethargy might remain during treatment.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
The pharmacokinetic profile of maropitant when administered as a single oral dose of 2 mg/kg body weight to dogs was characterised by a maximum concentration (Cmax) in plasma of approximately 81 ng/ml; this was achieved within 1.9 hours post-dosing (Tmax).
Peak concentrations were followed by a decline in systemic exposure with an apparent elimination half-life (t0.5) of 4.03 hours.
At a dose of 8 mg/kg, Cmax of 776 ng/ml was reached at 1.7 hours post-dosing.
The elimination half- life at 8 mg/kg was 5.47 hours.
The inter-individual variation in kinetics may be large, up to 70 CV% for AUC.
During clinical studies maropitant plasma levels conferred efficacy from 1 hour after administration.
5 Estimates for the oral bioavailability of maropitant were 23.7% at 2 mg/kg and 37.0% at 8 mg/kg.
The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) determined after intravenous administration at 1 - 2 mg/kg ranged from approximately 4.4 to 7.0 l/kg.
Maropitant displays non-linear pharmacokinetics (AUC increases more than proportionally with increasing dose) when administered orally within the 1 - 16 mg/kg dose range.
Following repeated oral administration for five consecutive days at a daily dose of 2 mg/kg, accumulation was 151%.
Following repeated oral administration for two consecutive days at a daily dose of 8 mg/kg, accumulation was 218%.
Maropitant undergoes cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism in the liver.
CYP2D15 and CYP3A12 were identified as the canine isoforms involved in the hepatic biotransformation of maropitant.
Renal clearance is a minor route of elimination, with less than 1% of an 8 mg/kg oral dose appearing in the urine as either maropitant or its major metabolite.
Plasma protein binding of maropitant in dogs is more than 99%.

DOSAGE FOR EACH SPECIES, ROUTE(S) AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
For oral use
For Treatment and Prevention of Vomiting (except Motion Sickness)
To treat and/or prevent vomiting except motion sickness, Cerenia tablets should be administered once daily, at a dose of 2 mg maropitant per kg bodyweight, using the number of tablets given in the table below.
Tablets are breakable along the score line on the tablet.
To prevent vomiting, tablets should be given more than 1 hour in advance.
The duration of the effect is approximately 24 hours and, therefore, tablets can be given the night before administration of an agent that may cause emesis (e.g. chemotherapy).
Cerenia can be used to treat vomiting either as tablets or as solution for injection once daily for up to five days.

ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
To remove a tablet from the blister the following sequence should be carried out; • Firstly, fold or cut along the perforation between each tablet as shown by the scissor symbol . • Find the pull-back notch (or cut) as shown by the arrow symbol. • Holding one side of the cut firmly, pull the other side towards the centre of the blister until the tablet is visible • Remove table from blister and administer as instructed.
Note:
No attempt should be made to remove the tablet by pushing it through the blister backing as this will damage both the tablet and blister.
For motion sickness a light meal or snack before dosing is recommended, prolonged fasting before administration should be avoided.
