Getting default parameters
This pre-calibrates the screen by sending colored and gray patches to your screen and measuring them with the hardware device.
Reading the patches
Reading the patches using the color measuring instrument.
Generating the patches
Generating the patches that will be measured with the color instrument.
Drawing the patches
Drawing the generated patches to the screen, which will then be measured by the hardware device.
Generating the profile
Generating the ICC color profile that can be used with this screen.
Copying files
Copying source image, chart data and CIE reference values.
Measuring the patches
Detecting the reference patches and measuring them.

Wait for the ink to dry
Please wait a few minutes for the ink to dry. Profiling damp ink will produce a poor profile and may damage your color measuring instrument.

The pattern match wasn't good enough. Ensure you have the correct type of target selected.
The measuring instrument got no valid readings. Please ensure the aperture is fully open.
The measuring instrument is busy and is not starting up. Please remove the USB plug and re-insert before trying to use this device.
Reading target
Failed to read the strip correctly.
Retry
Read strip %s rather than %s!
It looks like you've measured the wrong strip.
If you've really measured the right one, it's okay, it could just be unusual paper.
Use anyway
Device Error
The device could not measure the color spot correctly.
Ready to read strip %s
Place the colorimeter on the area of white next to the letter and click and hold the measure switch.
Slowly scan the target line from left to right and release the switch when you get to the end of the page.
Ensure the center of the device is properly aligned with the row you are trying to measure.
If you make a mistake just release the switch and you'll get a chance to try again.

Could not calibrate and profile using this color measuring instrument
This color measuring instrument is not designed to support calibration and profiling projectors.
Profile Precision
A higher precision profile provides higher accuracy in color matching but requires more time for reading the color patches.
For a typical workflow, a normal precision profile is sufficient.
The high precision profile also requires more paper and printer ink.
Custom
Before calibrating the display, it is recommended to configure your display with the following settings to get optimal results.
You may want to consult the owner's manual for your display on how to achieve these settings.
Reset your display to the factory defaults.
Disable dynamic contrast if your display has this feature.
Configure your display with custom color settings and ensure the RGB channels are set to the same values.
If custom color is not available then use a 6500K color temperature.
Adjust the display brightness to a comfortable level for prolonged viewing.
For best results, the display should have been powered for at least 15 minutes before starting the calibration.

Please choose a profiling mode
Please indicate if you want to profile a local printer, generate some test patches, or profile using existing test patches.
Install missing files?
Common color target files are not installed on this computer.
Color target files are needed to convert the image to a color profile.
Do you want them to be installed?
If you already have the correct file, you can skip this step.
Please select a calibration target
Before profiling the device, you have to manually capture an image of a calibration target and save it as a TIFF image file.
Ensure that the contrast and brightness are not changed and color correction profiles are not applied.
The device sensor should have been cleaned prior to scanning and the output file resolution should be at least 200dpi.
Ensure that the white-balance has not been modified by the camera and that the lens is clean.
For best results, the reference target should also be less than two years old.
Please select the calibration target type which corresponds to your reference file.

Introduction to display calibration
This dialog will help calibrate your display and create a custom ICC profile.
The calibration will involve several steps so that an accurate profile can be obtained.
It should only take a few minutes.
It may help to sit further from the screen or to squint at the calibration images in order to accurately compare the colors.
You can repeat the calibration steps as many times as you want.
Create table item %i/%i
Please try to match up the gray square with the surrounding alternating bars. You should match the brightness first, and then if required change the color tint so it looks plain gray.
Summary
This display is now calibrated. You can change the current profile using the Color Profiles program.

Image is not suitable without conversion
The supplied image contains an alpha channel which the profiling tools do not understand.
It is normally safe to convert the image, although you should ensure that the generated profile is valid.
