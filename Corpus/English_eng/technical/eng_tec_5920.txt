transxx
1
Create a pseudo translated PO file from a PO template file
transxx template. pot
Description
transxx is a command-line tool that produces a basic fleshed-out PO-file from a PO-template file. Some of the formatting and structure of the msgid strings will be copied to the msgstr strings, but otherwise text will be translated to xx.
The fleshed-out PO-file is sent to standard output.
Running your software with the language xx will quickly show you any user visible strings that are not translatable.
This utility is part of the KDE Software Development Kit.
