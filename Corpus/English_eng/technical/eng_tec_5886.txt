ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
The Fundamentals
If you have ever used a text editor, you will have no problem using & kate;. In the next two sections, Starting & kate; and in Working with & kate;, we'll show you everything you need to get up and running quickly.
Starting & kate;
You can start & kate; from the & kmenu; or from the command line.
From the Menu
Open the & kde; program menu by clicking on the big K icon on the toolbar at the bottom left of your screen. This will raise a menu. Move your cursor up the menu to the Applications Utilities Advanced Text Editor & kate; menu item.
Unless you configure & kate; not to, it will load the last files you edited. See Configuring & kate; to learn how to toggle this feature on and off.
From the Command Line
You can start & kate; by typing its name on the command line. If you give it a file name, as in the example below, it will open or create that file.
% kate myfile. txt
If you have an active connection, and permission, you can take advantage of & kde; 's network transparency to open files on the internet.
% kate ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde/ README
Command Line Options
& kate; accepts following command line options:
kate --help
This lists the most basic options available at the command line.
kate --help-qt
This lists the options available for changing the way & kate; interacts with & Qt;.
kate --help-kde
This lists the options available for changing the way & kate; interacts with & kde;.
kate -s --start name
Starts kate with the session name. The session is created if it does not exist already. If a & kate; instance running the specified session exists, the specified files are loaded in that instance. When used with the --use option, an instance running this session will be used as well.
kate -u --use URL
Causes & kate; to use and existing instance if there is one. If you want all documents to open in one kate instance, you can add this option to the default command in your kde application configuration, as well as create a shell alias in your command intepreter if it supports that.
kate -p --pid PID
Only reuses an instance with the specified PID (Process ID). Used with the --use option.
kate -e --encoding encoding URL
Uses the specified encoding for the document.
kate -l --line line URL
Navigates to the specified line after opening the document.
kate -c --column column URL
Navigates to the specified column after opening the document.
kate -i --stdin
Reads the document content from STDIN. This is similar to the common option - used in many command line programs, and allows you to pipe command output into & kate;.
kate --tempfile
Since & kate; 2.5.1 this standard & kde; option is supported. When used, the specified files are treated as temporary files and deleted (if they are local files and you have sufficient permissions) when closed, unless they are modified since they were opened.
kate --help-all
This lists all of the command line options.
kate --author
Lists & kate; 's authors in the terminal window.
kate -v --version
Lists version information for & Qt;, & kde;, and & kate;.
kate --license
Shows license information.
Drag and Drop
& kate; uses the & kde; Drag and Drop protocol. Files may be dragged and dropped onto & kate; from the Desktop, the filemanager & dolphin; or some remote ftp site opened in one of & dolphin; 's windows.
Working with & kate;
Quick Start will show you how to toggle four simple options that will let you configure some of & kate; 's more powerful features right away. Shortcuts lays out some of the default keystroke shortcuts for those who ca n't or do n't want to use a mouse.
Quick Start
This section will describe some of the items on the Settings menu so that you can quickly configure & kate; to work the way you want it.
When you start & kate; for the first time you'll see two windows with white backgrounds. Above the two windows is a toolbar with the usual labeled icons. And above that, a menubar.
The left-hand window is a side bar. It combines the Documents and Filesystem Browser windows. Switch between the two by clicking on the tabs to the left of the window.
If you've started & kate; with a file, the right-hand window will show the file you are editing and the Documents on the side bar will show the name of the file. Use the Filesystem Browser window to open files.
You can toggle the Documents and Filesystem Browser window on and off in Window Tool Views menu. This menu offers you your first glimpse into & kate; 's power and flexibility. In this section we'll look at three items:
Show Documents
Toggles the Documents on and off. If the Documents/ Filesystem Browser window is not open, & kate; launches the side bar as a separate, undocked, window. To dock the window grab the two thin parallel lines above the tabs by clicking on them with your & LMB; and holding the button down. Drag the window into & kate; 's editing window and release the & LMB; when you have positioned the Documents/ Filesystem Browser window as you prefer.
If you have grabbed the two parallel lines successfully your mouse pointer will turn into two crossed arrows as you drag.
Show Filesystem Browser
Toggles the Filesystem Browser on and off. This menu item is the same as Show Documents with one difference. Toggling it on launches the window with the Filesystem Browser on top.
Show Terminal
Toggles a terminal emulator on and off at the bottom of & kate; 's window. In other words, it gives you a command line within the application.
Shortcuts
Many of & kate; 's keystroke commands (shortcuts) are configurable by way of the Settings menu. By default & kate; honors the following key bindings.
Insert
Toggle between Insert and Overwrite mode. When in insert mode the editor will add any typed characters to the text and push any previously typed data to the right of the text cursor. Overwrite mode causes the entry of each character to eliminate the current character.
Left Arrow
Move the cursor one character to the left
Right Arrow
Move the cursor one character to the right
Up Arrow
Move the cursor up one line
Down Arrow
Move the cursor down one line
Page Up
Move the cursor up one page
Page Down
Move the cursor down one page
Backspace
Delete the character to the left of the cursor
Home
Move the cursor to the beginning of the line
End
Move the cursor to the end of the line
Delete
Delete the character to the right of the cursor (or any selected text)
& Shift; Enter
Insert newline including leading characters of the current line which are not letters or numbers. It is useful & eg; to write comments in the code: At the end of the line / / some text press this shortcut and the next line starts already with / /. So you do not have to enter the comment characters at the beginning of each new line with comments.
& Shift; Left Arrow
Mark text one character to the left
& Shift; Right Arrow
Mark text one character to the right

Using Sessions
Sessions is how & kate; lets you keep more than one list of files and GUI configuration around. You can have as many named sessions as you want, and you can use unnamed or anonymous sessions for files you want to use only once. Currently & kate; can save the list of open files, and the general window configuration in the session, future versions of & kate; may add more features that can be saved in sessions. With the introduction of sessions, & kate; also allows you to open any number of instances of the application instead of just one as it used to do as the default behavior.
Sessions are supported in three areas:
Command line options that lets you select and start sessions when launching kate from the command line.
The Sessions menu that lets you switch, save, start and manage your sessions
Configuration options that lets you decide how sessions generally should behave.
When starting a new session, the GUI configuration of Default Session is loaded. To save window configuration in the default session, you need to enable saving window configuration in the sessions configuration page of the configuration dialog and then load the default session, set up the window as desired and save the session again.
When a named session is loaded, & kate; will display the session name at the start of the window title, which then have the form & quot; Session Name: Document name or & URL; - & kate; quot;
When opening files on the command line with --start name or if a session is selected using the session chooser, the specified session is loaded prior to the files specified on the command line. To open files from the commandline in a new, unnamed session, configure kate to start a new session as default in the session page of the configuration dialog or use --start with an empty string: ''.
Since & kate; 2.5.1 the PID of the current instance is exported to the environment variable KATE_PID. When opening files from the built in terminal Kate will automatically select the current instance if nothing else is indicated on the command line.
Restoring old style & kate; behavior
When you get used to using sessions you will hopefully see that they provide a very simple and efficient tool for working in different areas. However, if you prefer the old & kate; behavior (one instance opens all files), you can easily achieve that by following this simple strategy:
Make kate always start with the --use parameter by adding that to the command in the application preferences, and additionally using a shell alias.
Configure & kate; to load the last used session at startup.
Configure & kate; to save the file list when closing a session.
Load the default session once
Getting Help
With & kate;
This manual
Offers detailed documentation on all menu commands, configuration options, tools, dialogs, plugins & etc; as well as descriptions of of the & kate; window, the editor and various concepts used in the application.
Press F1 or use the Help kate; Handbook menu topic to view this manual.
What's This Help
What's This help offers immediate help with single elements of graphical windows, such as buttons or other window areas.
We strive to provide What's This help for any elements for which it makes sense. It is available throughout the configuration dialog, and in many other dialogs as well.
To employ What's This help, press Shift; F1 or use the Help What's This menu item to enable What's This mode. The cursor will turn into an arrow with a question mark, and you can now click any element in the window to read the What's This help for that element, if it is available.
Help Buttons in Dialogs
Some dialogs have a Help Button. Pressing it will start the & khelpcenter; and open the relevant documentation.
With Your Text Files
& kate; does not (yet!) provide any means for reading document related documentation. Depending on the file you are editing, you may find the Built in Terminal Emulator helpful for viewing related & UNIX; manual pages or info documentation, or you can use & konqueror;.
kate --stdin
