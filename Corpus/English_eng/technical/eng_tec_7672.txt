Texture Compression

Framebuffer object
Render all frames indirectly using framebuffer objects (GL_EXT_framebuffer_object), if supported by the driver. Pros: Might be faster than the default buffer swapping method in some cases. Cons: This will come at the cost of (1) usually reduced graphics benchmark performance; (2) increased GPU resource consumption; and (3) possibly higher visible lag. Note: This feature is always on in OpenGL|ES builds such as ARM platforms.
Vertex buffer object
Render all graphics primitives using vertex buffer objects (GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object), if supported by the driver. Pros: This provides higher graphics performance for some drivers. Cons: This is a new feature and may cause graphical problems. Note: This feature is always on in OpenGL|ES builds such as ARM platforms.
Always use buffer swapping
Use glXSwapBuffers to display every frame. This eliminates visible tearing with most drivers and dramatically improves visual smoothness. Automatically enabled when framebuffer_object is on.
Unredirect Driver Blacklist
If non-empty, specifies a POSIX (extended) regular expression to match against the OpenGL driver strings (newline separated): "GL_VENDOR\
GL_RENDERER\
GL_VERSION". If the regular expression matches a substring of that concatenation then no windows will ever be unredirected while using that particular graphics driver.
