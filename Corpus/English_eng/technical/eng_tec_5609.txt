Introduction
& kformula; is used to write formulas. It does n't evaluate anything. All it does is print them.
& kformula; was designed for your editing pleasure. It makes it delightful to enter Greek letters, fractions and all the stuff that makes a formula look like a formula.
But most of the time you wo n't want to use & kformula; itself. Instead you might choose to use it from within & kword; or any other & koffice; application. That is & kformula; is not a useful application on its own but an extension to all the other & koffice; applications you've fallen in love with.
Where ever & kformula; gets embedded, it will behave the same.
Basics
A new (empty) & kformula; document looks like a small blue square. This square stands for the central idea of & kformula;. It represents an empty list. The idea of & kformula; is to have different elements arranged in lists. An element in this respect might be a single char or a root symbol or something like that. The lists are put together so that they form a formula. That is there are lists for indexes, lower and upper bounds and so on. And of course there is the main list, which we've already seen.
Writing a formula means to fill the empty list with letters, figures and mathematical symbols. That is straightforward: use your keyboard. As soon as you type something the empty symbol will vanish and you will see whatever you have inserted instead. New characters are always put at the current cursor position.
There is a toolbar called Add that allows you to create more complex elements. There are indices, fractions, roots and matrices to name a few. All these elements consist of at least one list, you can move the cursor into and insert new items.
Using & kformula;
Below is a typical formula entry in & kformula;. To enter the partial derivatives and Greek letters click on the symbol combo box, on the right, and select the appropriate symbol. The symbol combo box, in the figure below, has the word Cap on it. Click on the return key symbol to the right of it, to enter a symbol.

To enter matrices, click on the [] and then click on the matrix symbol. You can move from matrix element to matrix element using the arrow keys Right arrow, Up arrow, Down arrow and Left arrow. An example matrix is shown below.
Here is the resulting matrix;

Advanced Editing
Name insertion
A special feature is the name insertion. The blue square you type into is actual a list. Furthermore, that list can contain other lists. When you type a backslash (\\) you get a new empty list right away. But this one is special. It uses a different font and is meant to insert things like function names. There is, however, a second idea here. Your keyboard only has a limited number of keys. The wealth of mathematical symbols on the other side is overwhelming. To get one of those you can type its name and press the space bar afterwards. The name you typed will be replaced by the symbol then. In this context, the Space bar means get out of here, that is move the cursor to the containing list. The cursor will be positioned at the end of what you just entered but will also enclose part of the original formula, after pressing the space bar.
Another thing you might want to insert are spaces. We all know, printing formulae is all about the right spacing. And you can do just that using a name list.
Inside the blue square do:\\, SPACE to get a small space.
Do:\\ lt; Space to get a medium space.
Do:\\; Space to get a thick space.
Do:\\ quad Space to get a quadruple wide space.
In the same way, specific mathematical symbols can be inserted.\\ oint Space inserts the path integral about a closed contour. Below is the result of\\ oint Space:
Picture of path integral
Editing Formulas
The Edit Edit Formula String allows the user to edit the ASCII formulas that have been copied from other applications, such as Scilab, and transform them directly into mathematical type. An example will make this clear. Below is a screenshot of INRIA Scilab.
Scilab picture
Copy and paste the text beginning with x*sin(30*x) into the formula editor as shown below:
Scilab formula edit picture
If you click on OK, the editor will complain about aborted parsing. It cannot recognize one of the symbols in the formula. The displayed formula would show that the Pi symbol is not correctly rendered. This means that the% must be deleted. Do this and & kformula; will render the mathematical font properly, as shown below.
Scilab formula rendered in & kformula;
The formula editor will accept most C language mathematical expressions, like the formulas from a Runge-Kutta program below:
void derives(float x, float y[], float dydx[]) {dydx[1] = y[2]; dydx[2] = -0.8*x*y[2] - sin(x)*y[1];}
Here dydx[1] is the first order derivative and dydx[2] is the second order derivative. After copying the formula, you will have to edit the derivatives with & kformula;. Here is how it is done. First copy and paste the bottom expression into the formula editor.
Runge-Kutta in editor;
Next remove the [], leaving just y's.
Runge-Kutta edited
Now click OK and place the cursor by a y and delete it. Insert the appropriate symbols as shown below.
Runge-Kutta in & kformula;
Not every expression that & kformula; is capable of translates into a valid C expression. For example the superscript expression:
Superscript in & kformula;
is displayed as ()**(), which is not a valid C statement for exponentiation. Similarly the 1 by 2 matrix displays as ()/ (). This is not a valid array in C.
Definite Integrals and Indices
Definite Integrals
A definite integral is made by using Ctrl; U for the upper limit of integration and Ctrl; L for the lower limit of integration.
definite integral
Reposition the cursor in front of the integral after making the first of the limits.
Positioning Indices
The upper or lower index can be positioned by highlighting the desired text. In this example, an arrow is needed above the P, in dP. Using Ctrl; U places the desired vector symbol in the wrong place; namely above the d.
The problem is solved by highlighting only the P in and then entering Ctrl; U. Here is the correct result.
