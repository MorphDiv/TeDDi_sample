KTurtle is an educational programming environment that aims to make learning how to program as easy as possible. To achieve this KTurtle makes all programming tools available from the user interface. The programming language used is TurtleScript which allows its commands to be translated.
KTurtle
Cies Breijs
Initiator and core developer
Niels Slot
Core developer
Mauricio Piacentini
File or URL to open (in the GUI mode)
Starts KTurtle in D-Bus mode (without a GUI), good for automated unit test scripts
Starts KTurtle in testing mode (without a GUI), directly runs the specified local file
Specifies the localization language by a language code, defaults to "en_US" (only works in testing mode)
Translates turtle code to embeddable C++ example strings (for developers only)
