19xx/20xx Years
The year in a date entry is often entered as two digits.
Internally, the year is managed by $[officename] as four digits, so that in the calculation of the difference from 01/01/99 to 01/01/01, the result will correctly be two years.
Tools - Options - $[officename] - General
you can define the century that is used when you enter a year with only two digits.
The default is 1930 to 2029.
This means that if you enter a date of 01/01/30 or higher, it will be converted to the internal date 01/01/1930 or higher.
All lower two-digit years are converted to the 20xx century.
So, for example, 01/01/20 is converted into 01/01/2020.
