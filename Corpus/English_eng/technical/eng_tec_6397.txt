Introduction
& ksirtet; is a clone of the well known game Tetris. You must fit the falling pieces to form full lines. You can rotate and translate the falling piece. The game ends when no more pieces can fall, & ie; when your incomplete lines reach the top of the board.
Every time you have destroyed 10 lines, you advance to the next level and the pieces fall quicker (to be precise, the pieces fall from the top of the screen each 1/ (1+level) second).
How to Play
Handling the Falling Piece
You can use the keyboard to rotate, translate or drop down the falling piece. The keys are configurable via the menu item Settings Configure Shortcuts....
Game Types
& ksirtet; supports two types of single player game: Normal and Arcade. In Normal mode, points totals are kept, and high scores recorded. Also, when advancing to the next level, play continues without clearing the gameboard. In Arcade mode, no points totals are kept, although an Elapsed time counter is shown. When you advance to the next level in Arcade mode, the gameboard is cleared of pieces.
You can choose the game mode in the Mode menu.
How to gain Points
There are two sources of points:
Dropping down a piece using the Down Arrow gives a small number of points which is equal to the drop height. It is not much each time but is particularly relevant in the earlier levels, when the pieces fall more slowly.
The biggest part of the score comes from destroying full lines. It is very important to note that destroying multiple lines at the same time gives you a lot more points. A four-lines destruction is called a tetris: it gives a maximum amount of points.
The points gained are 40 for a one-liner, 100 for two lines, 300 for three lines and 1200 for a tetris. These numbers are multiplied by the current level. For example, destroying four lines in level 10 gives 12,000 points.
Configuring & ksirtet;
The & ksirtet; configuration is accessed from the menu item Settings Configure & ksirtet;.... The options are as follows:
Game Configuration
Initial level:
Set the level which you will play at startup, from 1 (easiest) to 20 (hardest). Default is level one.
Direct drop down
If checked, pressing the Down Arrow will cause a tile to immediately fall to the bottom of the screen. If unchecked, pressing the Down Arrow only causes the piece to fall until the key is released.
Old rotation style
& ksirtet; has two ways of rotating each piece: Old style and New style. Each style uses a different point to rotate the piece around. Try both, and see which one you prefer.
Appearance Configuration
Enable animations
If checked, pieces are shown with an animation (a small rebound effect), when they touch the bottom.
Show piece's shadow
If checked, a shadow is placed beneath the game board showing where the piece will fall.
Show next piece
If checked, shows the next tile that will fall onto the game board.
Show detailed "removed lines" field
If checked, the Removed Lines counter on the left of the screen shows how many times each number of lines have been removed. If unchecked, just the total number removed is shown.
Background
Select the color and the opacity for & ksirtet; background. An opacity of zero makes the & ksirtet; background completely transparent, and a setting of one makes the & ksirtet; background completely opaque.
Colors Configuration
Here you can select the colors used for the tiles in & ksirtet;.
A. I. Configuration
Here you can configure the A. I. in & ksirtet;.
Configuring Highscores
The configuration is accessed from Settings Configure Highscores.... The options are as follows:
The Main Tab
Nickname:
Displays your current nickname and allows you to change it.
Comment
A comment about yourself. You choose...
World-wide high scores enabled
If checked and if you are connected to the Internet, & ksirtet; will send your score automatically at the end of the game to the high score web server (ksirtet. sf. net).
The Advanced Tab
This tab displays your Registration Data on ksirtet. sf. net:
Displays your current nickname from the Main tab.
Key:
This key was generated when you registered on ksirtet. sf. net by selecting World-wide high scores enabled the first time. The registration key is used in conjunction with the nickname to identify uniquely users, but users cannot have the same nickname. Click on the Remove button to delete you from the world highscores list.
Multiplayer
The multiplayer option allows you to play with others players on the same computer. You can also play against an AI (artificial intelligence) player which is currently not very good.
Basically when destroying lines, a player sends garbage at the bottom of the game of his next opponent: nothing for one line destroyed, one garbage line for two lines destroyed and so on.
