Report Navigator
Report Builder
by choosing
View - Report Navigator
.
The Report Navigator reveals the structure of the report.
You can use the Report Navigator to insert functions into the report.
Click an entry in the Report Navigator.
The corresponding object or area is selected in the Report Builder view.
Right-click an entry to open the context menu.
To enter functions to the report
In the context menu of the Report Navigator, you will see the same commands as in the Report Builder view, plus additional commands to create new functions or to delete them.
OpenFormula
proposal.
Wiki page about Base
for some more help regarding the functions in a report.
To calculate a sum for each client
Open the Report Navigator.
Open the Groups entry and the group where you want to calculate the cost.
The group has a sub entry called functions.
Open the context menu (right-click) on the functions entry, choose to create a new function, and select it.
In the property browser you will see the function.
Change the name to e.g.
CostCalc and the formula to [CostCalc] + [enter your cost column name].
In the initial value enter 0.
Now you can insert a text field and bind it to your [CostCalc] (appears in the data field list box).
Maybe you have to set the initial value to the value of the field like [field].
If there are blank fields in the cost column, use the following formula to replace the blank fields' content with zero:
[SumCost] + IF(ISBLANK([field]); 0; [field])
need some real working examples.
See i81874
Formula
Enter the formula that defines the function.
Use OpenFormula syntax.
Initial value
Enter the initial value for the evaluation of the formula.
Often this is set to 0 or to 1.
Deep traversing
If Deep traversing is enabled, functions are evaluated considering all lower levels of hierarchy.
This would be used for instance for line numbering.
If Deep traversing is not enabled, only the first level of hierarchy is evaluated.
Pre evaluation
If Pre evaluation is enabled, functions are evaluated only when the report is finished.
