EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
TRIZIVIR
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Trizivir?
Trizivir is a medicine containing three active substances: abacavir (300 mg), lamivudine (150 mg) and zidovudine (300 mg).
It is available as blue-green, capsule-shaped tablets.
What is Trizivir used for?
Trizivir is an antiviral medicine.
It is used to treat adults who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
It is used to replace treatment with the three components taken at doses similar to those in Trizivir.
Patients should have already been taking the three active substances separately for at least six to eight weeks before switching to Trizivir.
Doctors should prescribe Trizivir after considering the expected improved ability of the patient to stick to their treatment, the expected effectiveness of the medicine, and the risk associated with the active substances.
They should prescribe Trizivir to patients with high levels of HIV in the blood (above 100,000 copies/ ml) only after careful consideration.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Trizivir used?
Treatment with Trizivir should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the management of HIV infection.
The recommended dose of Trizivir for patients over 18 years of age is one tablet twice a day, with or without food.
If patients need to stop taking abacavir, lamivudine or zidovudine, or need to take different doses because of problems with their kidneys, liver or blood, they will need to take medicines containing abacavir, lamivudine or zidovudine separately.
Trizivir should not be taken by patients who have problems with their liver or who have kidney failure.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
Patients who take Trizivir must be given the special alert card that summarises the key safety information about the medicine.
How does Trizivir work?
All three active substances in Trizivir, abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine, are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).
They all work in similar ways by blocking the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme produced by HIV that allows it to infect cells and make more viruses.
Trizivir reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.
Trizivir does not cure HIV infection or AIDS, but it may delay the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.

How has Trizivir been studied?
No specific clinical studies have been carried out with the combined tablet.
The company presented the results of studies of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine taken together, as carried out during the development of Ziagen.
The company also looked at the way the combined tablet was absorbed in the body in comparison to the separate tablets.
What benefit has Trizivir shown during the studies?
In the studies carried out for the development of Ziagen, the combination of the three active substances was shown to be at least as effective as the comparator combinations in keeping viral loads low.
The combination tablet was absorbed in the body in the same way as the separate tablets
What is the risk associated with Trizivir?
The most common effects when taking Trizivir (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are headache and nausea (feeling sick).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Trizivir, see the Package Leaflet.
Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions) occur in about 5% of patients taking Trizivir, usually within the first six weeks of treatment.
Some of these cases can be fatal.
Symptoms almost always include fever or rash, but also very commonly include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, signs of liver damage in the blood, myalgia (muscle pain), dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), cough, lethargy and malaise (feeling unwell).
Patients treated with Trizivir receive a card detailing these symptoms so that they are aware of them, and must contact their doctor immediately if they develop a reaction.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
Trizivir should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to lamivudine, zidovudine, abacavir or any of the other ingredients, who have problems with their liver, or who have kidney failure.
Because it contains zidovudine, it should also not be used by patients with low neutrophil (a type of white blood cell) counts or anaemia (low levels of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body).
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Trizivir may be at risk of developing lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), immune reactivation syndrome (reactions to disease-causing organisms by the recovering immune system) and osteonecrosis (death of cells in the bone, which makes the bones fragile).
Patients who have problems with their liver (including hepatitis B or C infection) may be at an elevated risk of liver damage when taking Trizivir.
As with all NRTIs, Trizivir may also cause lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body) and, in the babies of mothers taking Trizivir during pregnancy, mitochondrial dysfunction (damage to the energy-producing components within cells that can cause problems in the blood).
Why has Trizivir been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Trizivir’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of HIV infection in adults.
This fixed combination replaces the three components (abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine) used separately in similar dosages.
The Committee noted that the reduction in the number of tablets that patients need to take may help patients to stick to their treatment, and that the benefit of Trizivir has mainly been shown in patients who have had little or no previous HIV treatment and who have non-advanced disease.
The Committee recommended that Trizivir be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Trizivir:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Trizivir to Glaxo Group Ltd on 28 December 2000.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 28 December 2005.
