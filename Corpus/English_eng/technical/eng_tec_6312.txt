Overview
& policykit-kde; is a implementation of PolicyKit tool to the look and feel of KDE.
PolicyKit allows easy and secure password management, it can be used by applications to ask their users for a password. Each application defines a set of actions that can be executed by their program. The application will call PolicyKit to see if the user can perform a given action, if not, the application can issue the auth dialog where the user can enter his/ her password, root password, the password of a given group of users or even swipe the finger.
& policykit-kde; consists of two applications: The Authorization agent that receives requests for authentication, and shows a dialog asking for a password. The Authorization manager that is used to manage the authorizations, it is mainly used by system administrators that may want to change the default behavior of a program policies.
For Qt/ KDE developers there is Qt library to allow easy integration with you application and PolicyKit.
