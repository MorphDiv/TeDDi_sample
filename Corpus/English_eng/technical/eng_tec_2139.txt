Statistical Functions Part One
INTERCEPT function
points of intersection
intersections
mw added two entries
INTERCEPT
Calculates the point at which a line will intersect the y-values by using known x-values and y-values.
Syntax:
INTERCEPT(DataY; DataX)
DataY
is the dependent set of observations or data.
DataX
is the independent set of observations or data.
Names, arrays or references containing numbers must be used here.
Numbers can also be entered directly.
Example:
To calculate the intercept, use cells D3:D9 as the y-values and C3:C9 as the x-values from the example spreadsheet.
Input will be as follows:
=INTERCEPT(D3:D9; C3:C9)
= 2.15.
COUNT function
numbers;counting
mw added one entry
COUNT
Counts how many numbers are in the list of arguments.
Text entries are ignored.
Syntax:
COUNT(Value1; Value2; ...
Value30)
Value1; Value2; ...
Value30
are 1 to 30 values or ranges representing the values to be counted.
Example:
2, 4, 6
and
eight
in the
value 1 - 4
fields are to be counted.
=COUNT(2; 4; 6; &quot; eight &quot; )
= 3.
The count of numbers is therefore
3
.
COUNTA function
number of entries
mw added one entry
COUNTA
Counts how many values are in the list of arguments.
Text entries are also counted, even when they contain an empty string of length 0.
If an argument is an array or reference, empty cells within the array or reference are ignored.
Syntax:
COUNTA(Value1; Value2; ...
Value30)
Value1; Value2; ...
Value30
are 1 to 30 arguments representing the values to be counted.
Example:
2, 4, 6
and
eight
in the
value 1 - 4
fields are to be counted.
=COUNTA(2; 4; 6; &quot; eight &quot; )
= 4.
The count of values is therefore
4
.

mw added one entry
B
Returns the probability of a sample with binomial distribution.
Syntax:
B(Trials; SP; T1; T2)
Trials
is the number of independent trials.

defines the lower limit for the number of trials.
T2
(optional) defines the upper limit for the number of trials.
Example:
What is the probability with ten throws of the dice, that a six will come up exactly twice?
The probability of a six (or any other number) is 1/6.
The following formula combines these factors:
=B(10; 1/6; 2)
returns a probability of 29%.

Syntax:
RSQ(DataY; DataX)
DataY
is an array or range of data points.
DataX

and

Alpha
is a parameter to the distribution.
Beta
is a parameter to the distribution.
Start
(optional) is the lower bound for
number
.
End
(optional) is the upper bound for
number
.
Cumulative
(optional) can be 0 or False to calculate the probability density function.
It can be any other value or True or omitted to calculate the cumulative distribution function.
Example:
=BETADIST(0.75; 3; 4)
returns the value 0.96
BINOMDIST function
BINOMDIST
Returns the individual term binomial distribution probability.
Syntax:
BINOMDIST(X; Trials; SP; C)
X
is the number of successes in a set of trials.
Trials
is the number of independent trials.
SP
is the probability of success on each trial.
C
= 0 calculates the probability of a single event and
C
= 1 calculates the cumulative probability.
Example:
=BINOMDIST(A1; 12; 0.5; 0)
shows (if the values
0
to
12
are entered in A1) the probabilities for 12 flips of a coin that
Heads
will come up exactly the number of times entered in A1.
=BINOMDIST(A1; 12; 0.5; 1)
shows the cumulative probabilities for the same series.
For example, if A1 =
4
, the cumulative probability of the series is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 times
Heads
(non-exclusive OR).
CHISQINV function
CHISQINV
Returns the inverse of CHISQDIST.
Syntax:
Probability
is the probability value for which the inverse of the chi-square distribution is to be calculated.
Degrees Of Freedom
is the degrees of freedom for the chi-square function.
CHIINV function
CHIINV
Returns the inverse of the one-tailed probability of the chi-square distribution.
Syntax:
CHIINV(Number; DegreesFreedom)
Number
is the value of the error probability.
DegreesFreedom
is the degrees of freedom of the experiment.
Example:
A die is thrown 1020 times.
The numbers on the die 1 through 6 come up 195, 151, 148, 189, 183 and 154 times (observation values).
The hypothesis that the die is not fixed is to be tested.
The chi-square distribution of the random sample is determined by the formula given above.
Since the expected value for a given number on the die for n throws is n times 1/6, thus 1020/6 = 170, the formula returns a chi-square value of 13.27.
If the (observed) chi-square is greater than or equal to the (theoretical) chi-square CHIINV, the hypothesis will be discarded, since the deviation between theory and experiment is too great.
If the observed chi-square is less that CHIINV, the hypothesis is confirmed with the indicated probability of error.
=CHIINV(0.05; 5)
returns 11.07.
=CHIINV(0.02; 5)
returns 13.39.
If the probability of error is 5%, the die is not true.
If the probability of error is 2%, there is no reason to believe it is fixed.
CHITEST function
CHITEST
Returns the probability of a deviance from a random distribution of two test series based on the chi-square test for independence.
CHITEST returns the chi-square distribution of the data.
The probability determined by CHITEST can also be determined with CHIDIST, in which case the chi-square of the random sample must then be passed as a parameter instead of the data row.
Syntax:
CHITEST(DataB; DataE)
DataB
is the array of the observations.
DataE
is the range of the expected values.
Example:
DataB (observed)
DataE (expected)
1
195
170
2
151
170
3
148
170
4
189
170
5
183
170
6
154
170
=CHITEST(A1:A6; B1:B6)
equals 0.02.
This is the probability which suffices the observed data of the theoretical chi-square distribution.
CHIDIST function
CHIDIST
Returns the probability value from the indicated chi-square that a hypothesis is confirmed.
CHIDIST compares the chi-square value to be given for a random sample that is calculated from the sum of (observed value-expected value)^2/expected value for all values with the theoretical chi-square distribution and determines from this the probability of error for the hypothesis to be tested.
The probability determined by CHIDIST can also be determined by CHITEST.
Syntax:
CHIDIST(Number; DegreesFreedom)
Number
is the chi-square value of the random sample used to determine the error probability.
DegreesFreedom
are the degrees of freedom of the experiment.
Example:
=CHIDIST(13.27; 5)
equals 0.02.
If the chi-square value of the random sample is 13.27 and if the experiment has 5 degrees of freedom, then the hypothesis is assured with a probability of error of 2%.

CHISQDIST
Returns the value of the probability density function or the cumulative distribution function for the chi-square distribution.
Syntax
CHISQDIST(Number; DegreesOfFreedom; Cumulative)
Number
is the number for which the function is to be calculated.

is the degrees of freedom for the chi-square function.
Cumulative
(optional):
0 or False calculates the probability density function.

EXPONDIST
Returns the exponential distribution.
Syntax:
EXPONDIST(Number; Lambda; C)
Number
is the value of the function.
Lambda
is the parameter value.
UFI removed a double bookmark
C
is a logical value that determines the form of the function.
C = 0
calculates the density function, and
C = 1
calculates the distribution.
Example:
=EXPONDIST(3; 0.5; 1)
returns 0.78.
