Audible Bell
Use & system bell
Use customized bell
If this option is checked, the default system bell will be used. See the "System Bell" control module for how to customize the system bell. Normally, this is just a "beep".
Check this option if you want to use a customized bell, playing a sound file. If you do this, you will probably want to turn off the system bell. Please note that on slow machines this may cause a "lag" between the event causing the bell and the sound being played.
