This function returns the portion of haystack which starts at the last occurrence of needle and goes until the end of haystack.
Returns FALSE if needle is not found.
If needle contains more than one character, the first is used.
If needle is not a string, it is converted to an integer and applied as the ordinal value of a character.
Example 1. strrchr() example
/ / get last directory in $PATH $dir = substr( strrchr($PATH, ":"), 1); / / get everything after last newline $text = "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"; $last = substr(strrchr($text, 10), 1);
