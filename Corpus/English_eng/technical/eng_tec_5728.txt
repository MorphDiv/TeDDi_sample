16 bits color depth
If enabled, all RAW files will be decoded in 16-bit color depth using a linear gamma curve. To prevent dark picture rendering in the editor, it is recommended to use Color Management in this mode. If disabled, all RAW files will be decoded in 8-bit color depth with a BT.709 gamma curve and a 99th-percentile white point. This mode is faster than 16-bit decoding.
Interpolate RGB as four colors
Interpolate RGB as four colorsThe default is to assume that all green pixels are the same. If even-row green pixels are more sensitive to ultraviolet light than odd-row this difference causes a mesh pattern in the output; using this option solves this problem with minimal loss of detail. To resume, this option blurs the image a little, but it eliminates false 2x2 mesh patterns with VNG quality method or mazes with AHD quality method.

Do not stretch or rotate pixels
Do not stretch or rotate pixelsFor Fuji Super CCD cameras, show the image tilted 45 degrees. For cameras with non-square pixels, do not stretch the image to its correct aspect ratio. In any case, this option guarantees that each output pixel corresponds to one RAW pixel.

Quality (interpolation)Select here the demosaicing RAW images decoding interpolation method. A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process used to interpolate a complete image from the partial raw data received from the color-filtered image sensor internal to many digital cameras in form of a matrix of colored pixels. Also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction, another common spelling is demosaicing. There are 4 methods to demosaicing RAW images: Bilinear: use high-speed but low-quality bilinear interpolation (default - for slow computer). In this method, the red value of a non-red pixel is computed as the average of the adjacent red pixels, and similar for blue and green. VNG: use Variable Number of Gradients interpolation. This method computes gradients near the pixel of interest and uses the lower gradients (representing smoother and more similar parts of the image) to make an estimate. PPG: use Patterned Pixel Grouping interpolation. Pixel Grouping uses assumptions about natural scenery in making estimates. It has fewer color artifacts on natural images than the Variable Number of Gradients method. AHD: use Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed interpolation. This method selects the direction of interpolation so as to maximize a homogeneity metric, thus typically minimizing color artifacts.

White BalanceConfigure the raw white balance: Default D65: Use a standard daylight D65 white balance. Camera: Use the white balance specified by the camera. If not available, reverts to default neutral white balance. Automatic: Calculates an automatic white balance averaging the entire image. Manual: Set a custom temperature and green level values.

HighlightsSelect here the highlight clipping method: Solid white: clip all highlights to solid whiteUnclip: leave highlights unclipped in various shades of pinkBlend: Blend clipped and unclipped values together for a gradual fade to whiteRebuild: reconstruct highlights using a level value
Level:
LevelSpecify the reconstruct highlight level. Low values favor whites and high values favor colors.
Auto Brightness
If disable, use a fixed white level and ignore the image histogram to adjust brightness.
Brightness:
BrighnessSpecify the brightness level of output image. The default value is 1.0 (works in 8-bit mode only).
Black:
Black pointUse a specific black point value to decode RAW pictures. If you set this option to off, the Black Point value will be automatically computed.
Black point valueSpecify specific black point value of the output image.
White:
White pointUse a specific white point value to decode RAW pictures. If you set this option to off, the White Point value will be automatically computed.
White point valueSpecify specific white point value of the output image.

Camera ProfileSelect here the input color space used to decode RAW data. None: no input color profile is used during RAW decoding. Embedded: use embedded color profile from RAW file, if it exists. Custom: use a custom input color space profile.

WorkspaceSelect here the output color space used to decode RAW data. Raw (linear): in this mode, no output color space is used during RAW decoding. sRGB: this is an RGB color space, created cooperatively by Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft. It is the best choice for images destined for the Web and portrait photography. Adobe RGB: this color space is an extended RGB color space, developed by Adobe. It is used for photography applications such as advertising and fine art. Wide Gamut: this color space is an expanded version of the Adobe RGB color space. Pro-Photo: this color space is an RGB color space, developed by Kodak, that offers an especially large gamut designed for use with photographic outputs in mind. Custom: use a custom output color space profile.
