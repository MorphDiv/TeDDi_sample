Sorting and Grouping
Report Builder
, you can define the fields that should be sorted in your report, and the fields that should be kept together to form a group.
If you group your report by a certain field, all records with the same value of that field will be kept together in one group.
The Groups box shows the fields in an order from top to bottom.
You can select any field, then click the Move Up or Move Down button to move this field up or down in the list.
The sorting and grouping will be applied in the order of the list from top to bottom.
Lists the fields that will be used for sorting or grouping.
The field at the top has the highest priority, the second field has the second priority, and so on.
Click to open a list from which you can select a field.
Moves the selected field up in the list.
Moves the selected field down in the list.
Select the sorting order.
Select to show or hide the Group Header.
Select to show or hide the Group Footer.
Select to create a new group on each changed value, or on other properties.
Removes the selected field from the list.
By default a new group is created on every changed value of a record from the selected field.
You can change this property depending on the type of field:
For fields of type Text, you can select Prefix Characters and enter a number n of characters in the text box below.
The records which are identical in the first n characters will be grouped together.
For fields of type Date/Time, you can group the records by the same year, quarter, month, week, day, hour, or minute.
You can additionally specify an interval for weeks and hours:
2 weeks groups data in biweekly groups, 12 hours groups data in half-day groups.
For fields of type AutoNumber, Currency, or Number, you specify an interval.
Enter the group interval value that records are grouped by.
Select the level of detail by which a group is kept together on the same page.
When you specify to keep together some records on the same page, you have three choices:
No - page boundaries are not taken into account.
Whole Group - prints the group header, detail section, and group footer on the same page.
With First Detail - prints the group header on a page only if the first detail record also can be printed on the same page.
