Specifies which geninfo executable to use to generate coverage information
The geninfo executable from the lcov toolset is needed to create a visualizable format from gcov code coverage data.

Configuration for coverage report colors. In the directory view of the coverage report, each directory coverage percentage is represented using a color. The color associated to each percentage is taken from a color range, made up of several stop points. Stop points represent a color at a specific percentage. A color range has two different and independent modes: discrete and gradient. In discrete type, all percentage values between the previous stop point and the current one have the color of the current one. In gradient type, the values are interpolated between the previous stop point's color and the current stop point's color.

Color range type
Choose the type of color range to be used in the coverage report colors.
Coverage Report
GCOV code coverage statistics. Set the directory to generate the report for and start the scan. Once finished, you can select the directories in the coverage report to see their statistics. A more detailed report can be seen for each directory, showing all the covered files in it. Each file can also be shown in the editor, annotated with line by line coverage information.
The directory to scan for. gcda files.
Build Path:
Start coverage analysis
Start coverage analysis in the specified path. The directory and, recursively, its subdirectories are scanned for. gcda files.
Filter directories by name
When the report is in directory mode, only those containing the specified text in their path are shown. In file mode, the filter has no effect.
Percentage of covered lines in the selected directories.
Line Coverage:
-
Number of covered lines in the selected directories. Covered lines are those that were executed at least once.
Covered Lines:
Total number of lines of code in the selected directories. Note that it only includes executable lines. That is, things like comments, macros, forward declarations, etc. are not taken into account.
Total SLOC:
Coverage report. In directory mode, the report summarizes the coverage with a list of all the directories that contain at least one covered file. It could include directories out of the specified path, depending on the files included in the source code. In file mode, all the files of the selected directory are shown. If several directories are selected, only the files of the last selected directory are shown. Double clicking on any of the items shows the associated file in the editor, annotated with the coverage information. You can change between directory and file mode using left and right keys.
A stop point in the current color range type.
Color:
Color for this stop point
For percentage:
Percentage for this stop point
Add new stop point
Adds a new stop point after this one to the current color range type.
Remove this stop point
Removes this stop point from the current color range type.
