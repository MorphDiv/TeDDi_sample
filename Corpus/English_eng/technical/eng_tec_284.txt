Error Report Tool
The Error Report Tool starts automatically when a program crash occurs.
If the program enters into an endless loop, so that it does not respond to mouse-clicks or keypresses, you can also start the Error Report Tool manually.
The Error Report Tool gathers all necessary information that can help the program developers to improve the code, so that in later versions this error can possibly be avoided.
Please help us to improve the software and send the generated error report.
Sun Microsystems is committed to respecting your on-line privacy and recognises your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information you share with us.

Starting the Error Report Tool
With most program crashes the Error Report Tool will start automatically.
However, if the program seems to be stuck and the tool does not start automatically, you can start the tool manually:
Completing the Report
On the main Error Report Tool dialogue box, you can enter some additional information that may help the developers to localise the error.
For example, if the error only appears after a change in your hardware or software environment, or if you clicked on a button, please include that information.
Sending the Error Report
Send
button.
support forum
on the Internet.
You may choose to respond to questions that the developers may have about the reported error.
Mark the check box if you allow to be contacted by e-mail, should additional information be required.
By default this check box is not marked, so you will not get any e-mail.
What Data is Sent?
Show Report
button on the main dialogue box of the Error Report Tool to view what will get sent in the main file.
In addition, relevant memory contents and stack traces are gathered by some system standard tools ( &quot; dbhhelp.dll &quot; on Windows systems, &quot; pstack &quot; on UNIX systems).
This information will be sent also.
