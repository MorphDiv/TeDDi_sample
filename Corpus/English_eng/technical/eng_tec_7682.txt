3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection.
Turbid white suspension.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.
Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with official guidance.
(see sections 4.2 and 5.1)
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Daronrix has been evaluated with a haemagglutinin content of 15 µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 years following a 0, 21 day schedule.
Adults from the age of 18 to 60 years will receive two doses of Daronrix, the first administered at an elected date, the second at least three weeks after the first dose for maximum efficacy.
No data have been generated with Daronrix below 18 years of age.
Therefore health care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in that population.
For pregnant women, see section 4.6.
2 For further information, see section 5.1.
Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection.
4.3 Contraindications
History of an anaphylactic reaction (i. e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents or trace residues (e. g. eggs, chicken protein, gentamicin sulphate) of this vaccine.
However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need.
See section 4.4.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to residues e. g. eggs, chicken protein, gentamicin sulphate.
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.
If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection.
Daronrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly.
Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Daronrix should not be given at the same time as other vaccines.
However, if co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs.
It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified.
The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment.
Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV-1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV-1 have been observed.
The Western Blot technique disproves the results.
The transient false positive reactions could be due to the IgM response by the vaccine.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
No data have been generated with Daronrix in pregnant women.
Therefore health care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations.
Data from vaccinations with interpandemic trivalent vaccines in pregnant women do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine.
Daronrix may be used during lactation.
3 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The vaccine is unlikely to produce an effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
• Clinical trials
Adverse reactions from clinical trials with different formulations (H5N1, H2N2 and H9N2) (N=941) of the mock-up vaccine are listed here below (see section 5.1 for more information on mock-up vaccines).
Two hundred and one subjects received the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (A/ H5N1).
The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects > 60 years of age was lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population.
Undesirable effects reported are listed according to the following frequency:
Very common (≥ 1/ 10) Common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10) Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100) Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000) Very rare (< 1/ 10,000) Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)
Infections and infestations Uncommon: nasopharyngitis, rhinitis
Nervous system disorders Very common: headache
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common: sweating increase, ecchymosis
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Common: myalgia, arthralgia
General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: pain and redness at the site of injection, fatigue Common: swelling and induration at the site of injection, shivering, fever Uncommon: injection site pruritis
These reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment.
• Post-marketing surveillance
From Post-marketing surveillance with interpandemic trivalent vaccines, the following adverse events have been reported:
Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100):
Generalised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash.
Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000):
Neuralgia, paraesthesia, convulsions, transient thrombocytopenia.
Allergic reactions, in rare cases leading to shock, have been reported.
4 Very rare (< 1/ 10,000):
Vasculitis with transient renal involvement.
Neurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome.
This medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and therefore, it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01.
This section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccines following a two-dose administration.
Mock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating influenza viruses.
These antigens can be considered as “ novel” antigens and simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve.
Data obtained with the mock-up vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines.
A clinical study has evaluated the immunogenicity of the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (A/ H5N1) with a haemagglutinin content of 15 µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 years (N=48) following a 0, 21 day schedule.
The seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-HA antibody were as follows:
anti-HA antibody
21 days after 1st dose
21 days after 2nd dose
Seroprotection rate* Seroconversion rate Seroconversion factor * anti-HA ≥ 1:40
50.0% (95% CI:
35.2; 64.8) 47.9% (95% CI:
33.3; 62.8) 6 (95% CI:
3.5; 10.1)
70.8% (95% CI:
55.9; 83.0) 70.8% (95% CI:
55.9; 83.0) 12.4 (95% CI:
7.1; 21.8)
In this clinical study, the immunogenicity of the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (A/ H5N1) with a haemagglutinin content of 27µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 years (N=49) was also evaluated following a 0, 21 day schedule.
The seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-HA antibody were as follows 21 days after the first dose:
anti-HA antibody
21 days after 1st dose
Seroprotection rate* Seroconversion rate Seroconversion factor * anti-HA ≥ 1:40
5
73.5% (95% CI:
58.9; 85.0) 69.4% (95% CI:
54.6; 81.7) 14.5 (95% CI:
8.3; 25.4)
No clinical data have been generated in subjects below 18 years of age.
Although no clinical data have been generated with Daronrix in subjects > 60 years of age, the immunogenicity of a mock up formulation with different antigen doses of an aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (A/ H9N2) administered at 0, 21 days was evaluated in a clinical trial in this population.
These results indicated that higher antigen content may be needed in subjects above 60 years of age as compared to an adult population (18-60 years) in order to ensure optimal protection.
The persistence of antibodies for the mock-up vaccines varies.
With interpandemic trivalent vaccines, it is usually 6 - 12 months, but for Daronrix no data are available yet with the H5N1 strain.
In a clinical study where a mock-up formulation of aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (AH9/ N2) containing 3.8 µg HA was evaluated following a 0, 10 day schedule, it has been shown that a faster onset of protection could be reached as compared to the recommended 0, 21 day schedule.
However data suggested that the duration of protection might be shorter.
In circumstances when a fast onset of protection is needed, a third dose might therefore be necessary to ensure duration of protection.
Daronrix has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.

These antigens can be considered as “ novel” antigens and simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve.
Data obtained with the mock-up vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines.
A clinical study has evaluated the immunogenicity of the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (A/ H5N1) with a haemagglutinin content of 15 µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 years (N=48) following a 0, 21 day schedule.
The seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-HA antibody were as follows:
anti-HA antibody
21 days after 1st dose
21 days after 2nd dose
Seroprotection rate* Seroconversion rate Seroconversion factor * anti-HA ≥ 1:40
50.0% (95% CI:
35.2; 64.8) 47.9% (95% CI:
33.3; 62.8) 6 (95% CI:
3.5; 10.1)
70.8% (95% CI:
55.9; 83.0) 70.8% (95% CI:
55.9; 83.0) 12.4 (95% CI:
7.1; 21.8)
In this clinical study, the immunogenicity of the monovalent aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (A/ H5N1) with a haemagglutinin content of 27µg HA per dose in adults aged 18-60 years (N=49) was also evaluated following a 0, 21 day schedule.
The seroprotection rate, the seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-HA antibody were as follows 21 days after the first dose:
anti-HA antibody
21 days after 1st dose
Seroprotection rate*
17
73.5% (95% CI:
58.9; 85.0)
Seroconversion rate Seroconversion factor * anti-HA ≥ 1:40
69.4% (95% CI:
54.6; 81.7) 14.5 (95% CI:
8.3; 25.4)
No clinical data have been generated in subjects below 18 years of age.
Although no clinical data have been generated with Daronrix in subjects > 60 years of age, the immunogenicity of a mock up formulation with different antigen doses of an aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (A/ H9N2) administered at 0, 21 days was evaluated in a clinical trial in this population.
These results indicated that higher antigen content may be needed in subjects above 60 years of age as compared to an adult population (18-60 years) in order to ensure optimal protection.
The persistence of antibodies for the mock-up vaccines varies.
With interpandemic trivalent vaccines, it is usually 6 - 12 months, but for Daronrix no data are available yet with the H5N1 strain.
In a clinical study where a mock-up formulation of aluminium-adjuvanted whole virus vaccine (AH9/ N2) containing 3.8 µg HA was evaluated following a 0, 10 day schedule, it has been shown that a faster onset of protection could be reached as compared to the recommended 0, 21 day schedule.
However data suggested that the duration of protection might be shorter.
In circumstances when a fast onset of protection is needed, a third dose might therefore be necessary to ensure duration of protection.
Daronrix has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.

CONDITIONS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION
• CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS REGARDING SUPPLY AND USE IMPOSED ON THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Daronrix can only be marketed when there is an official WHO/ EU declaration of an influenza pandemic, on the condition that the Marketing Authorisation Holder for Daronrix takes due account of the officially declared pandemic strain.
• CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Not applicable
• OTHER CONDITIONS
Official batch release: in accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/ 83/ EC as amended, the official batch release will be undertaken by a state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose.
Pharmacovigilance system
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market and for as long as the marketed product remains in use.
The MAH commits to performing the studies and pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan.
PSUR submission during the influenza pandemic:
During a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/ 2004 will not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time.
Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic.
Prompt analysis of 21 cumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated.
In addition, duration a pandemic, resources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Reports in the format as defined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the European Union may not be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue.
In consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared (Phase 6 of the WHO global Influenza preparedness plan) and the pandemic vaccine is used, the MAH shall submit periodic safety update reports with periodicity and format defined as follows:
Frequency of submission
- The clock will start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine.
- First data-lock point is 14 days later.
- Report submission is no later than day 22 (i. e. the following Monday).
- Reporting to be fortnightly for the first 3 months of the pandemic.
- Periodicity will be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 3 monthly
intervals.
Format The report shall include the following Tables of aggregate data using the agreed templates:
1.
Fatal and/ or life-threatening reactions – for each Preferred Term (PT), including the proportion of fatal reports 2.
Adverse Events of Special Interest (PTs) 3.
Serious unexpected reactions (PTs) 4.
All events occurring in the following age groups:
6-23 months, 2-8 years, 8-17 years, 18-60 years, > 60 years All events occurring in pregnant women 5.
All events reported by patients that have been entered into the database by data-lock point 6.
A cumulative overview of all events reported during the period, stratified according to type of reporter (patient or health care professional), seriousness, expectedness, and whether spontaneous or solicited.
Presentation of data will take into consideration the following recommendations:
- Serious expected reactions will be reviewed by the MAH as part of their signal detection
procedures and will only form part of the report if an issue of concern arises.
- All tables will be based on number of events (presented on PT level, sorted by System
Organ Class [SOC]) and not number of cases.
- Tables 1 to 4 will be based on events reported from healthcare professionals only.
- In Tables 1 to 5, numbers will be provided for events received during the reporting period
and cumulatively.
- All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data.
Product-specific data
can be evaluated during signal work-up.
- A measure of relative reporting rate of signals for each reported PT should be provided if
possible (e. g.
Proportional reporting ratio [PRR], Information Component [IC)] or the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean [EBMG]; this is not mandatory as all MAHs do not yet have this capability.
- No line listings are required – these can be provided in signal evaluation reports as
necessary.
A short summary shall also be provided with the periodic safety update reports, in which any area of concern should be highlighted, signal work-up prioritised (if the event of multiple signals) and appropriate timelines for submission of a full signal evaluation report provided.
All signal evaluation reports should be provided, including those that were subsequently not identified as being signals.
22 A summary of vaccine distribution shall be included and provide details of the number of doses of vaccine distributed in:
i) ii) iii)
EU member states for the reporting period by batch number, EU member states cumulatively and the rest of the world
Risk Management plan
An updated Risk Management Plan should be provided as per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use.
C.
SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS TO BE FULFILLED BY THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER

Further information
1.
WHAT DARONRIX IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Daronrix is a vaccine used in adults aged 18 to 60 years to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.
Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly to affect most countries and regions around the world.
The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of “ ordinary” flu but are usually more severe.
2.
BEFORE YOU RECEIVE DARONRIX
Daronrix should not be given:
• if you have previously had any allergic reaction to Daronrix, or any ingredient (including eggs, chicken protein, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic)) contained in this vaccine.
The active substances and other ingredients in Daronrix are listed at the end of the leaflet.
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.
However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need.
Take special care with Daronrix:
• if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).
A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first.
Using other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine.
If you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment (such as radiotherapy) that affects the immune system, Daronrix can still be given but your response to the vaccine may be poor.
38 Pregnancy and breast-feeding There is no information on the use of Daronrix in pregnant women.
Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and potential risks of giving you the vaccine if you are pregnant.
Please tell your doctor if you are pregnant.
Daronrix may be used during lactation.
Driving and using machines After administration of Daronrix, it is unlikely that side effects would unable you to drive or use machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Daronrix Thiomersal (preservative) is present in this product, and it is possible that you may experience an allergic reaction.
3.
HOW IS DARONRIX GIVEN
Adults from the age of 18 to 60 years will receive two injections of Daronrix, the first injection will be administered at an elected date, the second at least three weeks after the first injection.
There is no information on the use of Daronrix below 18 years of age.
Your doctor needs to assess the benefits and potential risks of giving you the vaccine if you are below the age of 18 years.
The doctor will give Daronrix as an injection into your upper arm muscle.
The vaccine should never be given into a vein.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Daronrix can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
♦ Very common (more than 1 per 10 doses of vaccine): • Headache • Fatigue • Pain and redness at the injection site
♦ Common (less than 1 per 10 but more than 1 per 100 doses of vaccine): • Increased sweating, bruising • Aching muscles, joint pain • Swelling at the injection site, hard lump • Shivering, fever
♦ Uncommon (less than 1 per 100 but more than 1 per 1000 doses of vaccine): • Sore nose and throat and discomfort when swallowing, runny nose • Itching at the injection site
These reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment.
39 Other side effects which have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with ordinary flu vaccines include:
♦ Uncommon (less than 1 per 100 but more than 1 per 1000 doses of vaccine): • Generalised skin reactions such as itching, hives or rash
♦ Rare (less than 1 per 1000 but more than 1 per 10,000 doses of vaccine): • Severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves • Pins and needles • Fits • Low blood platelet count • Allergic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to collapse, coma and death
♦ Very rare (less than 1 per 10,000 doses of vaccine): • Narrowing or blockage of blood vessels with kidney problems • Inflammation of the brain and spinal column • Painful swelling in the arms or legs • Temporary inflammation of the nerves, causing pain, weakness and paralysis in the extremities and often progressing to the chest and face.
Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects.
It is possible that you have no side effects from vaccination.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
