E.
SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS TO BE FULFILLED BY THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER
The Marketing Authorisation Holder shall complete the following programme of studies, the results of which shall form the basis of the annual reassessment of the benefit/ risk profile.
More detailed information on the specific obligations is set out in the CVMP assessment report.
QUALITY ASPECTS
1) There are important outstanding issues regarding the differences of production and control between the manufacturing sites (including the nature of the eggs used), the lack of a validation study for the potency test on finished product (it appears that final product tests are only done at Weesp but in-process tests such as titration and HA quantification need to be equivalent too) and the lack of any stability data.
With regard to the differences in production and control, harmonization of the production process and the controls between both manufacturing site is strongly suggested.
An alternative solution could be to retain only one production site.
In particular, a rationalization of the nature of eggs used (taking into consideration the problem of the possible presence of extraneous agents in conventional eggs and the possibility to inactivate them during the inactivation process of the Influenza virus, supported by a corresponding validation study).
The Applicant is asked to commit to take appropriate measures to harmonise the productions and/ or to provide the adequate demonstrations/ data to solve the issues.
2) The Applicant should commit to generate stability data for the shelf life to be established.
PHARMACOVIGILANCE ASPECTS
3) The Applicant is required to submit 3-montly Periodic Update Safety reports for the first 2 years following the initial use in the field and is additionally required to present a protocol that would ensure adequate recording and reporting of field data in relation to suspected adverse reactions including suspected lack of efficacy.
