Defines the stylesheet to use when exporting results to HTML
This option specifies the number of spaces Tidy uses to indent content, when indentation is enabled.
Whether to do line wrapping.
This option specifies the right margin Tidy uses for line wrapping. Tidy tries to wrap lines so that they do not exceed this length.
This option specifies if Tidy should output tag names in upper case. The default is no, which results in lower case tag names, except for XML input, where the original case is preserved.
This option specifies if Tidy should output attribute names in upper case. The default is no, which results in lower case attribute names, except for XML input, where the original case is preserved.
This option specifies the DOCTYPE declaration generated by Tidy. If set to "omit" the output wo n't contain a DOCTYPE declaration. If set to "auto" (the default) Tidy will use an educated guess based upon the contents of the document. If set to "strict", Tidy will set the DOCTYPE to the strict DTD. If set to "loose", the DOCTYPE is set to the loose (transitional) DTD. Alternatively, you can supply a string for the formal public identifier (FPI).
This option specifies if Tidy should pretty print output, writing it as well-formed XML. Any entities not defined in XML 1.0 will be written as numeric entities to allow them to be parsed by a XML parser. The original case of tags and attributes will be preserved, regardless of other options.
This option specifies if Tidy should strip out surplus presentational tags and attributes replacing them by style rules and structural markup as appropriate. It works well on the HTML saved by Microsoft Office products.
This option specifies the character encoding Tidy uses for both the input and output.
