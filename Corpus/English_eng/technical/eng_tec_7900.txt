Usage: system-config-kickstart [--help] [--generate <filename>] [<kickstart_filename>]
 
--help Print out this message
--generate <filename> Generate a kickstart file from the current machine and write
 it to <filename>. This option runs on the console, so it is
 useful for servers that do not have X currently running.
<kickstart_filename> This option will cause the GUI to launch with the values from
 the kickstart file already filled in.
Could not open display because no X server is running.
Try running 'system-config-kickstart --help' for a list of options.

RAID Options
Software RAID allows you to combine several disks into a larger RAID device. A RAID device can be configured to provide additional speed and reliability compared to using an individual drive. For more information on using RAID devices please consult the kickstart documentation.
To use RAID you must first create at least two partitions of type 'software RAID'. Then you can create a RAID device which can be formatted and mounted.
Choose one of the following options:
Create a software RAID partition
Create a RAID device [default = /dev/md0]
