The mail() function allows you to send mail.
No external libraries are needed to build this extension.
There is no installation needed to use these functions; they are part of the PHP core.
The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini.

Here is a short explanation of the configuration directives.
Used under Windows only:
DNS name or IP address of the SMTP server PHP should use for mail sent with the mail() function.
Used under Windows only:
Number of the port to connect to the server specified with the SMTP setting when sending mail with mail(); defaults to 25.
Only available since PHP 4.3.0.
Which "From:" mail address should be used in mail sent from PHP under Windows.
Where the sendmail program can be found, usually / usr / sbin / sendmail or / usr / lib / sendmail. configure does an honest attempt of locating this one for you and set a default, but if it fails, you can set it here.
Systems not using sendmail should set this directive to the sendmail wrapper / replacement their mail system offers, if any.
For example, Qmail users can normally set it to / var / qmail / bin / sendmail or / var / qmail / bin / qmail-inject.
qmail-inject does not require any option to process mail correctly.
This extension has no resource types defined.
This extension has no constants defined.
