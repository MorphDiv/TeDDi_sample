4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of essential hypertension in adults.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily.
Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of 20 mg.
In cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be increased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily.
Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination with thiazide-type diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering effect with telmisartan.
When considering raising the dose, it must be borne in mind that the maximum antihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the start of treatment (see section 5.1).
Telmisartan may be taken with or without food.
Renal impairment:
No posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Limited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis.
A lower starting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment:
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4).
Elderly No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.
Paediatric patients Kinzalmono is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1)
2 • Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) • Lactation (see section 4.6) • Biliary obstructive disorders • Severe hepatic impairment
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Pregnancy:
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).
Hepatic impairment:
Kinzalmono is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile.
These patients can be expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan.
Kinzalmono should be used only with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
Renovascular hypertension:
There is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation:
When Kinzalmono is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended.
There is no experience regarding the administration of Kinzalmono in patients with recent kidney transplantation.
Intravascular hypovolaemia:
Symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Kinzalmono, may occur in patients who are volume and/ or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or vomiting.
Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Kinzalmono.
Volume and/ or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Kinzalmono.
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system:
As a consequence of inhibiting the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, hypotension and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that affect this system.
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. by adding an ACE- inhibitor to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist) is therefore not recommended in patients with already controlled blood pressure and should be limited to individually defined cases with close monitoring of renal function.
Other conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system:
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such as telmisartan has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Primary aldosteronism:
Patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.
Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not recommended.
3 Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:
As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Hyperkalaemia:
The use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause hyperkalaemia.
In the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/ or in patients with intercurrent events, hyperkalaemia may be fatal.
Before considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.
The main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:
- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (> 70 years)
- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system and/ or potassium supplements.
Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.
- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic
acidosis, worsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e. g. infectious diseases), cellular lysis (e. g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma).
Close monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5).
Sorbitol:
This medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take Kinzalmono.
Ethnic differences:
As observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II receptor antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population.
Other:
As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
As with others drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, telmisartan may provoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4).
The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim).
The occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors.
The risk is increased in case of the above-mentioned treatment combinations.
The risk is particularly high in combination with potassium sparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium.
A
4 combination with ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that precautions for use are strictly followed.
Concomitant use not recommended
Potassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements:
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss.
Potassium sparing diuretics e. g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium.
If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.
Lithium:
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan.
If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.
Concomitant use requiring caution
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products:
NSAIDs (i. e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non- selective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
In some patients with compromised renal function (e. g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Therefore, the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly.
Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter.
In one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the AUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat.
The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.
Diuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics):
Prior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide diuretic) may result in volume depletion and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with telmisartan.
To be taken into account with concomitant use
Other antihypertensive agents:
The blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other antihypertensive medicinal products.
Based on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan:
Baclofen, amifostine.
Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or antidepressants.
Corticosteroïds (systemic route):
Reduction of the antihypertensive effect.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
5 The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Pregnancy (see section 4.3 and 4.4):
There are no adequate data from the use of Kinzalmono in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia).
(See also section 5.3).
Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Lactation (see section 4.3):
Telmisartan is contraindicated during lactation since it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, when driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The overall incidence of adverse events reported with telmisartan (41.4%) was usually comparable to placebo (43.9%) in placebo controlled trials.
The incidence of adverse events was not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients.
The adverse drug reactions listed below have been accumulated from all clinical trials including 5788 hypertensive patients treated with telmisartan.
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data.

4.9 Overdose
There is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans.
Symptoms:
The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported.
Treatment:
Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis.
The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.
Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms.
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage.
Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage.
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently.
If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacement given quickly.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC Code:
C09CA07.
Mechanism of action:
Telmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist.
Telmisartan displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II.
Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor.
Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor.
The binding is long-lasting.
Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors.
The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan.
Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan.
Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels.
Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin.
Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin- mediated adverse effects.
In human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure increase.
The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.
Clinical efficacy and safety:
After the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours.
The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of treatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.
The antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements.
This is confirmed by trough to peak ratios consistently above 80% seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical studies.
There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to 8 recovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP).
In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are inconsistent.
In patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.
The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its hypotensive activity has still to be defined.
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
Upon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.
The incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive treatments.
Beneficial effects of telmisartan on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Absorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies.
The mean absolute bioavailability for telmisartan is about 50%.
When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6% (40 mg dose) to approximately 19% (160 mg dose).
By 3 hours after administration, plasma concentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.
Linearity/ non-linearity:
The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy.
There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels.
Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg.
Distribution:
Telmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (> 99.5%), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.
The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.
Metabolism:
Telmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound.
No pharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.
Elimination:
Telmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of > 20 hours.
The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose.
There is no evidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose.
Plasma concentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.
After oral (and intravenous) administration telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, mainly as unchanged compound.
Cumulative urinary excretion is < 1% of dose.
Total plasma clearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/ min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/ min).
Special Populations
Gender effects:
9 Differences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.
Elderly patients:
The pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years.
Patients with renal impairment:
In patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was observed.
However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing dialysis.
Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and cannot be removed by dialysis.
The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal impairment.
Patients with hepatic impairment:
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability up to nearly 100%.
The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in normotensive animals.
In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed.
Gastric mucosal injury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs.
These pharmacologically- mediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation.
In both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/ hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were observed.
These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.
There is no evidence of a teratogenic effect, but animal studies indicated some hazardous potential of telmisartan to the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight, delayed eye opening, and higher mortality.
There was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.

The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti- inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim).
The occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors.
The risk is increased in case of the above-mentioned treatment combinations.
The risk is particularly high in combination with potassium sparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium.
A combination with ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that precautions for use are strictly followed.
14 Concomitant use not recommended
Potassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements:
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss.
Potassium sparing diuretics e. g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium.
If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.
Lithium:
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan.
If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.
Concomitant use requiring caution
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products:
NSAIDs (i. e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non- selective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
In some patients with compromised renal function (e. g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Therefore, the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly.
Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter.
In one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the AUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat.
The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.
Diuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics):
Prior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide diuretic) may result in volume depletion and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with telmisartan.
Concomitant use to be taken into account
Other antihypertensive agents:
The blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other antihypertensive medicinal products.
Based on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan:
Baclofen, amifostine.
Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or antidepressants.
Corticosteroïds (systemic route):
Reduction of the antihypertensive effect.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
15 Pregnancy (see section 4.3 and 4.4):
There are no adequate data from the use of Kinzalmono in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia).
(See also section 5.3).
Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Lactation (see section 4.3):
Telmisartan is contraindicated during lactation since it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, when driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The overall incidence of adverse events reported with telmisartan (41.4%) was usually comparable to placebo (43.9%) in placebo controlled trials.
The incidence of adverse events was not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients.
The adverse drug reactions listed below have been accumulated from all clinical trials including 5788 hypertensive patients treated with telmisartan.
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

4.9 Overdose
There is limited information available with regard to overdose in humans.
Symptoms:
The most prominent manifestations of telmisartan overdose were hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia, dizziness, increase in serum creatinine, and acute renal failure have also been reported.
Treatment:
Telmisartan is not removed by haemodialysis.
The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.
Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms.
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage.
Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage.
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently.
If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacement given quickly.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic Group:
Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC Code:
C09CA07.
Mechanism of action:
Telmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist.
Telmisartan displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II.
Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor.
Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor.
The binding is long-lasting.
Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors.
The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan.
Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan.
Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels.
Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin.
Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin- mediated adverse effects.
In human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure increase.
The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.
Clinical efficacy and safety:
After the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours.
The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of treatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.
The antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements.
This is confirmed by trough to peak ratios consistently above 80% seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical studies.
There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP).
In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are inconsistent.
18 In patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.
The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its hypotensive activity has still to be defined.
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
Upon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.
The incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive treatments.
Beneficial effects of telmisartan on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Absorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies.
The mean absolute bioavailability for telmisartan is about 50%.
When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6% (40 mg dose) to approximately 19% (160 mg dose).
By 3 hours after administration, plasma concentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.
Linearity/ non-linearity:
The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy.
There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels.
Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg.
Distribution:
Telmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (> 99.5%), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.
The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.
Metabolism:
Telmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound.
No pharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.
Elimination:
Telmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of > 20 hours.
The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose.
There is no evidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose.
Plasma concentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.
After oral (and intravenous) administration telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, mainly as unchanged compound.
Cumulative urinary excretion is < 1% of dose.
Total plasma clearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/ min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/ min).
Special Populations
Gender effects:
Differences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.
Elderly patients:
19 The pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years.
Patients with renal impairment:
In patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was observed.
However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing dialysis.
Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and cannot be removed by dialysis.
The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal impairment.
Patients with hepatic impairment:
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability up to nearly 100%.
The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in normotensive animals.
In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed.
Gastric mucosal injury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs.
These pharmacologically- mediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation.
In both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/ hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were observed.
These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.
There is no evidence of a teratogenic effect, but animal studies indicated some hazardous potential of telmisartan to the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight, delayed eye opening, and higher mortality.
There was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of essential hypertension in adults.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
The usually effective dose is 40 mg once daily.
Some patients may already benefit at a daily dose of 20 mg.
In cases where the target blood pressure is not achieved, the dose of telmisartan can be increased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily.
Alternatively, telmisartan may be used in combination with thiazide-type diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering effect with telmisartan.
When considering raising the dose, it must be borne in mind that the maximum antihypertensive effect is generally attained four to eight weeks after the start of treatment (see section 5.1).
Telmisartan may be taken with or without food.
Renal impairment:
No posology adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Limited experience is available in patients with severe renal impairment or haemodialysis.
A lower starting dose of 20 mg is recommended in these patients (see section 4.4).
Hepatic impairment:
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the posology should not exceed 40 mg once daily (see section 4.4).
Elderly No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.
Paediatric patients:
Kinzalmono is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1) • Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6)
22 • Lactation (see section 4.6) • Biliary obstructive disorders • Severe hepatic impairment
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Pregnancy:
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).
Hepatic impairment:
Kinzalmono is not to be given to patients with cholestasis, biliary obstructive disorders or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3) since telmisartan is mostly eliminated with the bile.
These patients can be expected to have reduced hepatic clearance for telmisartan.
Kinzalmono should be used only with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
Renovascular hypertension:
There is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
Renal impairment and kidney transplantation:
When Kinzalmono is used in patients with impaired renal function, periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended.
There is no experience regarding the administration of Kinzalmono in patients with recent kidney transplantation.
Intravascular hypovolaemia:
Symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose of Kinzalmono, may occur in patients who are volume and/ or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea, or vomiting.
Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Kinzalmono.
Volume and/ or sodium depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Kinzalmono.
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system:
As a consequence of inhibiting the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system, hypotension and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) have been reported in susceptible individuals, especially if combining medicinal products that affect this system.
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. by adding an ACE- inhibitor to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist) is therefore not recommended in patients with already controlled blood pressure and should be limited to individually defined cases with close monitoring of renal function.
Other conditions with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system:
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (e. g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with medicinal products that affect this system such as telmisartan has been associated with acute hypotension, hyperazotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.8).
Primary aldosteronism:
Patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.
Therefore, the use of telmisartan is not recommended.
23 Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:
As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Hyperkalaemia:
The use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may cause hyperkalaemia.
In the elderly, in patients with renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients, in patients concomitantly treated with other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels, and/ or in patients with intercurrent events, hyperkalaemia may be fatal.
Before considering the concomitant use of medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, the benefit risk ratio should be evaluated.
The main risk factors for hyperkalaemia to be considered are:
- Diabetes mellitus, renal impairment, age (> 70 years)
- Combination with one or more other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system and/ or potassium supplements.
Medicinal products or therapeutic classes of medicinal products that may provoke hyperkalaemia are salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim.
- Intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic
acidosis, worsening of renal function, sudden worsening of the renal condition (e. g. infectious diseases), cellular lysis (e. g. acute limb ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, extend trauma).
Close monitoring of serum potassium in at risk patients is recommended (see section 4.5).
Sorbitol:
This medicinal product contains sorbitol (E420).
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take Kinzalmono.
Ethnic differences:
As observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, telmisartan and the other angiotensin II receptor antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population.
Other:
As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive reduction of blood pressure in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
As with others drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, telmisartan may provoke hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4).
The risk may increase in case of treatment combination with other medicinal products that may also provoke hyperkalaemia (salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, non steroidal anti- inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors), heparin, immunosuppressives (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and trimethoprim).
The occurrence of hyperkalaemia depends on associated risk factors.
The risk is increased in case of the above-mentioned treatment combinations.
The risk is particularly high in combination with potassium sparing-diuretics, and when combined with salt substitutes containing potassium.
A combination with ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs, for example, presents a lesser risk provided that precautions for use are strictly followed.
24 Concomitant use not recommended
Potassium sparing diuretics or potassium supplements:
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as telmisartan, attenuate diuretic induced potassium loss.
Potassium sparing diuretics e. g. spirinolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride, potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium.
If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.
Lithium:
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan.
If use of the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.
Concomitant use requiring caution
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products:
NSAIDs (i. e. acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and non- selective NSAIDs) may reduce the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
In some patients with compromised renal function (e. g. dehydrated patients or elderly patients with compromised renal function), the co-administration of angiotensin II receptor antagonists and agents that inhibit cyclo-oxygenase may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.
Therefore, the combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly.
Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter.
In one study the co-administration of telmisartan and ramipril led to an increase of up to 2.5 fold in the AUC0-24 and Cmax of ramipril and ramiprilat.
The clinical relevance of this observation is not known.
Diuretics (thiazide or loop diuretics):
Prior treatment with high dose diuretics such as furosemide (loop diuretic) and hydrochlorothiazide (thiazide diuretic) may result in volume depletion and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with telmisartan.
To be taken into account with concomitant use
Other antihypertensive agents:
The blood pressure lowering effect of telmisartan can be increased by concomitant use of other antihypertensive medicinal products.
Based on their pharmacological properties it can be expected that the following medicinal products may potentiate the hypotensive effects of all antihypertensives including telmisartan:
Baclofen, amifostine.
Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or antidepressants.
Corticosteroïds (systemic route):
Reduction of the antihypertensive effect.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4).
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).
25 Pregnancy (see section 4.3 and 4.4):
There are no adequate data from the use of Kinzalmono in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of drugs.
Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy.
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.
Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy exposure during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia).
(See also section 5.3).
Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.
Infants whose mothers have taken angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for hypotension (see also sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Lactation (see section 4.3):
Telmisartan is contraindicated during lactation since it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
However, when driving vehicles or operating machinery it should be taken into account that dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when taking antihypertensive therapy.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The overall incidence of adverse events reported with telmisartan (41.4%) was usually comparable to placebo (43.9%) in placebo controlled trials.
The incidence of adverse events was not dose related and showed no correlation with gender, age or race of the patients.

The patient should be closely monitored, and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.
Management depends on the time since ingestion and the severity of the symptoms.
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage.
Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage.
Serum electrolytes and creatinine should be monitored frequently.
If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, with salt and volume replacement given quickly.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic Group:
Angiotensin II Antagonists, plain, ATC Code:
C09CA07.
Mechanism of action:
Telmisartan is an orally active and specific angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist.
Telmisartan displaces angiotensin II with very high affinity from its binding site at the AT1 receptor subtype, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II.
Telmisartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor.
Telmisartan selectively binds the AT1 receptor.
The binding is long-lasting.
Telmisartan does not show affinity for other receptors, including AT2 and other less characterised AT receptors.
The functional role of these receptors is not known, nor is the effect of their possible overstimulation by angiotensin II, whose levels are increased by telmisartan.
Plasma aldosterone levels are decreased by telmisartan.
Telmisartan does not inhibit human plasma renin or block ion channels.
Telmisartan does not inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (kininase II), the enzyme which also degrades bradykinin.
Therefore it is not expected to potentiate bradykinin- mediated adverse effects.
In human, an 80 mg dose of telmisartan almost completely inhibits the angiotensin II evoked blood pressure increase.
The inhibitory effect is maintained over 24 hours and still measurable up to 48 hours.
Clinical efficacy and safety:
After the first dose of telmisartan, the antihypertensive activity gradually becomes evident within 3 hours.
The maximum reduction in blood pressure is generally attained 4 to 8 weeks after the start of treatment and is sustained during long-term therapy.
The antihypertensive effect persists constantly over 24 hours after dosing and includes the last 4 hours before the next dose as shown by ambulatory blood pressure measurements.
This is confirmed by trough to peak ratios consistently above 80% seen after doses of 40 and 80 mg of telmisartan in placebo controlled clinical studies.
There is an apparent trend to a dose relationship to a time to recovery of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP).
In this respect data concerning diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are inconsistent.
28 In patients with hypertension telmisartan reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure without affecting pulse rate.
The contribution of the medicinal product's diuretic and natriuretic effect to its hypotensive activity has still to be defined.
The antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan is comparable to that of agents representative of other classes of antihypertensive medicinal products (demonstrated in clinical trials comparing telmisartan to amlodipine, atenolol, enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril).
Upon abrupt cessation of treatment with telmisartan, blood pressure gradually returns to pre-treatment values over a period of several days without evidence of rebound hypertension.
The incidence of dry cough was significantly lower in patients treated with telmisartan than in those given angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical trials directly comparing the two antihypertensive treatments.
Beneficial effects of telmisartan on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Absorption of telmisartan is rapid although the amount absorbed varies.
The mean absolute bioavailability for telmisartan is about 50%.
When telmisartan is taken with food, the reduction in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of telmisartan varies from approximately 6% (40 mg dose) to approximately 19% (160 mg dose).
By 3 hours after administration, plasma concentrations are similar whether telmisartan is taken fasting or with food.
Linearity/ non-linearity:
The small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy.
There is no linear relationship between doses and plasma levels.
Cmax and to a lesser extent AUC increase disproportionately at doses above 40 mg.
Distribution:
Telmisartan is largely bound to plasma protein (> 99.5%), mainly albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.
The mean steady state apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) is approximately 500 l.
Metabolism:
Telmisartan is metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide of the parent compound.
No pharmacological activity has been shown for the conjugate.
Elimination:
Telmisartan is characterised by biexponential decay pharmacokinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of > 20 hours.
The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a smaller extent, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increase disproportionately with dose.
There is no evidence of clinically relevant accumulation of telmisartan taken at the recommended dose.
Plasma concentrations were higher in females than in males, without relevant influence on efficacy.
After oral (and intravenous) administration telmisartan is nearly exclusively excreted with the faeces, mainly as unchanged compound.
Cumulative urinary excretion is < 1% of dose.
Total plasma clearance (Cltot) is high (approximately 1,000 ml/ min) compared with hepatic blood flow (about 1,500 ml/ min).
Special Populations
Gender effects:
Differences in plasma concentrations were observed, with Cmax and AUC being approximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in females compared to males.
29 Elderly patients:
The pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years.
Patients with renal impairment:
In patients with mild to moderate and severe renal impairment, doubling of plasma concentrations was observed.
However, lower plasma concentrations were observed in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing dialysis.
Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma protein in renal-insufficient patients and cannot be removed by dialysis.
The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with renal impairment.
Patients with hepatic impairment:
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatic impairment showed an increase in absolute bioavailability up to nearly 100%.
The elimination half-life is not changed in patients with hepatic impairment.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In preclinical safety studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical therapeutic range caused reduced red cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit), changes in renal haemodynamics (increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), as well as increased serum potassium in normotensive animals.
In dogs, renal tubular dilation and atrophy were observed.
Gastric mucosal injury (erosion, ulcers or inflammation) also was noted in rats and dogs.
These pharmacologically- mediated undesirable effects, known from preclinical studies with both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, were prevented by oral saline supplementation.
In both species, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/ hyperplasia of the renal juxtaglomerular cells were observed.
These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical significance.
There is no evidence of a teratogenic effect but animal studies indicated some hazardous potential of telmisartan to the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight, delayed eye opening, and higher mortality.
There was no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice.

Further information
1.
WHAT KINZALMONO IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Kinzalmono belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
Angiotensin II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus increasing your blood pressure.
Kinzalmono blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered.
Kinzalmono is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure). ‘ Essential’ means that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition.
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead sometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness.
There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs.
Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE KINZALMONO
Do not take Kinzalmono
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to telmisartan or any other ingredients included in Kinzalmono tablets (see section Further information for a list of other ingredients). • during the last six months of pregnancy (see section Pregnancy and breast-feeding). • if you are breast-feeding. • if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kinzalmono.
Take special care with Kinzalmono
Please tell your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or illnesses:
• Kidney disease or kidney transplant.
48 • Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). • Liver disease. • Heart trouble. • Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various blood minerals). • Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ('water tablets'), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or vomiting. • Elevated potassium levels in your blood. • Diabetes.
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
Kinzalmono is not recommended in early pregnancy and may cause serious harm to your baby after 3 months of pregnancy (see section Pregnancy and breast-feeding).
In case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Kinzalmono.
The use of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.
As with all other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, Kinzalmono may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.
Taking other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medications or take other precautions.
In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines.
This applies especially to the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Kinzalmono:
• Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. • Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain'water tablets'), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e. g. aspirin or ibuprofen), heparin, immunosuppressives (e. g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. • Diuretics ('water tablets'), especially if taken in high doses together with Kinzalmono, may lead to excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension).
As with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Kinzalmono may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e. g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids.
Kinzalmono may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood pressure.
Taking Kinzalmono with food and drink
You can take Kinzalmono with or without food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
Usually, your doctor will advise you to take another medicine instead of Kinzalmono, as Kinzalmono is not recommended in early pregnancy, and may cause serious harm to your baby if it is used after 3 months of pregnancy.
Appropriate antihypertensive drug must usually replace Kinzalmono before starting a pregnancy.
Kinzalmono should not be used during the second and third trimester of pregnancy.
49 Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Kinzalmono as soon as you know you are pregnant.
If you become pregnant during therapy with Kinzalmono, please inform and see your doctor without delay.
You must not take Kinzalmono if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
No information is available on the effect of Kinzalmono on the ability to drive or operate machinery.
Some people feel dizzy or tired when they are treated for high blood pressure.
If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or operate machinery.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Kinzalmono
Kinzalmono contains sorbitol.
If you are intolerant to some sugars, consult your doctor before taking Kinzalmono.
3.
HOW TO TAKE KINZALMONO
Always take Kinzalmono exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
The usual dose of Kinzalmono is one tablet a day.
Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.
You can take Kinzalmono with or without food.
The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other non-alcoholic drink.
It is important that you take Kinzalmono every day until your doctor tells you otherwise.
If you have the impression that the effect of Kinzalmono is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
The usual dose of Kinzalmono for most patients is one 40 mg tablet once a day to control blood pressure over the 24-hour period.
Your doctor has recommended a lower dose of one 20 mg tablet daily.
Kinzalmono may also be used in combination with diuretics ('water tablets') such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering effect with Kinzalmono.
If your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once daily.
If you take more Kinzalmono than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital emergency department immediately.
If you forget to take Kinzalmono
If you forget to take a dose, do not worry.
Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before.
If you do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day.
Do not take a double dose to make up for forgotten individual doses.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.

1.
WHAT KINZALMONO IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Kinzalmono belongs to a class of medicines known as angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
Angiotensin II is a substance produced in your body which causes your blood vessels to narrow, thus increasing your blood pressure.
Kinzalmono blocks the effect of angiotensin II so that the blood vessels relax, and your blood pressure is lowered.
Kinzalmono is used to treat essential hypertension (high blood pressure). ‘ Essential’ means that the high blood pressure is not caused by any other condition.
High blood pressure, if not treated, can damage blood vessels in several organs, which could lead sometimes to heart attack, heart or kidney failure, stroke, or blindness.
There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure before damage occurs.
Thus it is important to regularly measure blood pressure to verify if it is within the normal range.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE KINZALMONO
Do not take Kinzalmono
• if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to telmisartan or any other ingredients included in Kinzalmono tablets (see section Further information for a list of other ingredients). • during the last six months of pregnancy (see section Pregnancy and breast-feeding). • if you are breast-feeding. • if you have severe liver problems such as cholestasis or biliary obstruction (problems with drainage of the bile from the liver and gall bladder) or any other severe liver disease.
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kinzalmono.
Take special care with Kinzalmono
Please tell your doctor if you are suffering or have ever suffered from any of the following conditions or illnesses:
54 • Kidney disease or kidney transplant. • Renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys). • Liver disease. • Heart trouble. • Raised aldosterone levels (water and salt retention in the body along with imbalance of various blood minerals). • Low blood pressure (hypotension), likely to occur if you are dehydrated (excessive loss of body water) or have salt deficiency due to diuretic therapy ('water tablets'), low-salt diet, diarrhoea, or vomiting. • Elevated potassium levels in your blood. • Diabetes.
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
Kinzalmono is not recommended in early pregnancy and may cause serious harm to your baby after 3 months of pregnancy (see section Pregnancy and breast-feeding).
In case of surgery or anaesthesia, you should tell your doctor that you are taking Kinzalmono.
The use of Kinzalmono in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended.
As with all other angiotensin antagonists, Kinzalmono may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients.
Taking other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Your doctor may need to change the dose of these other medications or take other precautions.
In some cases you may have to stop taking one of the medicines.
This applies especially to the medicines listed below taken at the same time with Kinzalmono:
• Lithium containing medicines to treat some types of depression. • Medicines that may increase blood potassium levels such as salt substitutes containing potassium, potassium-sparing diuretics (certain'water tablets'), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, e. g. aspirin or ibuprofen), heparin, immunosuppressives (e. g. cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and the antibiotic trimethoprim. • Diuretics ('water tablets'), especially if taken in high doses together with Kinzalmono, may lead to excessive loss of body water and low blood pressure (hypotension).
As with other blood pressure lowering medicines, the effect of Kinzalmono may be reduced when you take NSAIDs (non steroidal anti-inflammatory mediciens, e. g. aspirin or ibuprofen) or corticosteroids.
Kinzalmono may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of other medicines used to treat high blood pressure.
Taking Kinzalmono with food and drink
You can take Kinzalmono with or without food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
You must tell your doctor if you think that you are (or might become) pregnant.
Usually, your doctor will advise you to take another medicine instead of Kinzalmono, as Kinzalmono is not recommended
55 in early pregnancy, and may cause serious harm to your baby if it is used after 3 months of pregnancy.
Appropriate antihypertensive drug must usually replace Kinzalmono before starting a pregnancy.
Kinzalmono should not be used during the second and third trimester of pregnancy.
Your doctor will normally advise you to stop taking Kinzalmono as soon as you know you are pregnant.
If you become pregnant during therapy with Kinzalmono, please inform and see your doctor without delay.
You must not take Kinzalmono if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines
No information is available on the effect of Kinzalmono on the ability to drive or operate machinery.
Some people feel dizzy or tired when they are treated for high blood pressure.
If you feel dizzy or tired, do not drive or operate machinery.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Kinzalmono
Kinzalmono contains sorbitol.
If you are intolerant to some sugars, consult your doctor before taking Kinzalmono.
3.
HOW TO TAKE KINZALMONO
Always take Kinzalmono exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
The usual dose of Kinzalmono is one tablet a day.
Try to take the tablet at the same time each day.
You can take Kinzalmono with or without food.
The tablets should be swallowed with some water or other non-alcoholic drink.
It is important that you take Kinzalmono every day until your doctor tells you otherwise.
If you have the impression that the effect of Kinzalmono is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
The usual dose of Kinzalmono for most patients is one 40 mg tablet once a day to control blood pressure over the 24 hour period.
However, sometimes your doctor may recommend a lower dose of 20 mg or a higher dose of 80 mg.
Alternatively, Kinzalmono may be used in combination with diuretics ('water tablets') such as hydrochlorothiazide which has been shown to have an additive blood pressure lowering effect with Kinzalmono.
If your liver is not working properly, the usual dose should not exceed 40 mg once daily.
If you take more Kinzalmono than you should
If you accidentally take too many tablets, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or your nearest hospital emergency department immediately.
If you forget to take Kinzalmono
If you forget to take a dose, do not worry.
Take it as soon as you remember then carry on as before.
If you do not take your tablet on one day, take your normal dose on the next day.
