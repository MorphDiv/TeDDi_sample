What is internet radio?
Internet radio stations are similar to regular radio stations, allowing an individual or an organization to stream music live over the internet. Internet radio stations can be a simultaneous stream of a regular radio station, amateurs broadcasting their own station, or commercial radio stations that include live DJs and even commercials.

Many radio stations display either a button or a link to listen to their stream. In most web-browsers, you can right click on the link and choose
