Eur. potency test
2/ 16 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
A diffuse hard or soft swelling (max. diameter 5 cm) may occur, regressing within 2 days.
Pain at the injection site can occur occasionally.
In some cases fever may occur for 1 day, and up to 3 days in exceptional circumstances.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Can be used during pregnancy and lactation.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy from the concurrent use of this vaccine with any other vaccine.
Safety and efficacy of concurrent use with Tetanus-Serum from Intervet (see section 4.9) has been demonstrated.
It is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered concurrently or simultaneously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Intramuscular use
Vaccination schedule:
Primary vaccination course
Administer one dose (1ml), by intramuscular injection, according to the following schedule: • Primary vaccination course: first injection from 6 months of age, second injection 4 weeks later
Revaccination
The first revaccination is given not later than 17 months after the primary vaccination course.
Thereafter a maximum interval of two years is recommended (see scheme).

Equilis Te
In case of increased infection risk or insufficient colostrum intake, an additional initial injection can be given at the age of 4 months followed by the full vaccination programme (primary vaccination course at 6 months of age and 4 weeks later)
Concurrent active and passive immunisation (emergency vaccination)
The vaccine can be used together with Tetanus-Serum from Intervet for treatment of injured horses that have not been immunised against tetanus.
In that case, the first dose (V1) of vaccine can be given concurrently with the appropriate prophylactic dose of Tetanus-Serum from Intervet at a separate injection site, using separate syringes and needles.
This will lead to a passive protection against tetanus for at least 21 days after concurrent administration.
The second dose of the vaccine (V2) should be administered 4 weeks later.
A third vaccination with Equilis Te should be repeated at least four weeks later.
Concurrent use of Equilis Te and Tetanus-Serum from Intervet may reduce active immunity against tetanus compared to horses vaccinated with Equilis Te in the absence of tetanus antitoxin serum.

Following the administration of a double dose of vaccine, no side-effects other than those described under 4.6 have been observed except for some depression at the day of vaccination.
