42.5 mg/ g
For a full list of excipients see section 6.1
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Premix for medicated feeding stuff A beige granular powder
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Pigs
4.2 Indications for use
•
Treatment and prevention of Swine Enzootic Pneumonia caused by susceptible strains of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in pigs.
At the recommended dose, lung lesions and weight loss are reduced but infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is not eliminated.
•
Treatment of Porcine Proliferative Enteropathy (ileitis) caused by Lawsonia intracellularis in herds where there is a diagnosis based on clinical history, post-mortem findings and clinical pathology results.
•
Treatment of clinical outbreaks of Swine Dysentery, caused by Brachyspira hyodysenteriae in herds where the disease has been diagnosed and prevention of further clinical cases.
4.3 Contraindications
None
4.4 Special warnings
Acute cases and severely diseased pigs with reduced food or water intake should be treated with a suitable injectable product.
Generally, strains of B. hyodysenteriae have higher MIC values in cases of resistance against other macrolides, such as tylosin.
The clinical relevance of this reduced susceptibility is not fully explored.
Cross-resistance between tylvalosin and other macrolides cannot be excluded.
2 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
It is sound clinical practice to base treatment on susceptibility testing.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Because Aivlosin has been shown to cause hypersensitivity reactions in laboratory animals, people with known hypersensitivity to tylvalosin tartrate should avoid any contact with the product.
When mixing the veterinary medicinal product and handling the medicated feed, direct contact with eyes, skin and mucous membranes should be avoided.
Personal protective equipment should be worn when mixing the veterinary medicinal product or handling the medicated feed: overalls, impervious gloves and either a disposable half-mask respirator conforming to European Standard EN 149 or a non-disposable respirator conforming to European Standard EN 140, with a filter to European Standard EN 143.
Wash contaminated skin.
In case of accidental ingestion seek medical advice immediately and show the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
None known
4.7 Use during pregnancy and lactation
The safety of Aivlosin during pregnancy and lactation has not been established in pigs.
Use only in accordance with risk/benefit assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
Studies in laboratory animals have not produced any evidence of teratogenicity.
Maternal toxicity in rodents has been observed at doses of 400 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight and above.
In mice, a slight reduction in the foetal bodyweight was seen at doses causing maternal toxicity.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
None known
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
In-feed use.
For incorporation into dry feed only.
For treatment and prevention of Swine Enzootic Pneumonia The dosage is 2.125 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day in-feed for 7 consecutive days.
Secondary infection by organisms such as Pasteurella multocida and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae may complicate enzootic pneumonia and require specific medication.
For treatment of Porcine Proliferative Enteropathy (ileitis) The dosage is 4.25 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day in-feed for 10 consecutive days.
For treatment and prevention of Swine Dysentery The dosage is 4.25 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day in-feed for 10 consecutive days.

* Important: these inclusion rates are assumes a pig eats equivalent of 5% bodyweight per day.
In older pigs, or in pigs with reduced appetite, or on restricted feed intake, inclusion levels may need to be increased to achieve target dosage.
Where feed intake is reduced, use the following formula:
Dose rate (mg/kg bodyweight) x bodyweight (kg)
Kg Premix/tonne feed
=
Daily feed intake (kg) x Premix strength (mg/g)
As an adjunct to medication, good management and hygiene practices should be introduced in order to reduce the risk of infection and to control the build up of resistance.
A horizontal ribbon mixer should be used to incorporate the product into the feeding stuff.
It is recommended that Aivlosin is first mixed into 10 kg of the feeding stuff, followed by the rest of the feeding stuff and mixed well.
Medicated feed may then be pelleted.
Pelleting conditions involve a single pre-conditioning step with steam for 5 minutes and pelleting at not more than 70°C under normal conditions.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Macrolide antibiotic, ATC vet code:
QJ01FA92
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Tylvalosin tartrate is a macrolide antibiotic that has antibacterial activity against Gram-positive, some Gram-negative organisms and mycoplasma.
It acts by inhibiting protein synthesis in the bacteria cell.
Macrolide antibiotics are the metabolites or semi-synthetic derivatives of metabolites of soil organisms obtained by fermentation.
They have different sized lactone rings and due to the dimethylamino group, are basic.
Tylvalosin has a sixteen membered ring.
Macrolides interfere with protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 50S ribosome subunit.
They bind to the donor site and prevent the translocation necessary for keeping the peptide chain growing.
Their effect is essentially confined to rapidly dividing organisms.
Macrolides are generally considered bacteriostatic and mycoplasmastatic.
4 It is considered that there are multiple mechanisms responsible for resistance development to macrolide compounds: namely alteration of the ribosomal target site, utilisation of active efflux mechanism and production of inactivating enzymes.
Resistance to tylvalosin by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Lawsonia intracellularis has not been reported or found in the field to date.
No breakpoint for Brachyspira hyodysenteriae has been established.
Generally strains of B. hyodysenteriae have higher MIC values in cases of resistance against other macrolides, such as tylosin.
The clinical relevance of this reduced susceptibility is not fully explored.
Cross-resistance between tylvalosin and other macrolide antibiotics cannot be excluded.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Tylvalosin tartrate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of Aivlosin.
After administration of the recommended dose lung concentrations of 0.060 – 0.066 µg/ml were found at 2 and 12 hours post-treatment.
The parent compound is widely distributed in the tissues with the highest concentrations found in the lungs, bile, intestinal mucosa, spleen, kidney and liver.
There is evidence that the concentration of macrolides is higher at the site of infection than in plasma, in particular in neutrophils, alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells.
In vitro metabolism studies have confirmed that the parent compound is rapidly metabolised to 3-O- acetyltylosin.
In a trial with 14C aivlosin administered at 2.125 mg/kg to pigs for 7 days over 70% of the dose was excreted in the faeces, with urinary excretion accounting for 3 to 4% of the dose.

For treatment and prevention of Swine Dysentery The dosage is 4.25 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day for 10 consecutive days.
This is achieved by thoroughly mixing Aivlosin 8.5 mg/g Oral Powder into the daily ration for each individual pig.
Scoops of 3 sizes are provided for measuring the correct amount of Aivlosin 8. 5 mg/g Oral Powder for mixing with the daily ration, according to the schedule below.
The feed containing the oral powder should be provided as the sole ration for the periods recommended above.
The pig to be treated should be weighed and the amount of feed that the pig is likely to consume should be estimated, based on a daily feed intake equivalent to 5% of bodyweight.
Consideration must be given to pigs whose daily feed intake is reduced or restricted.
The correct quantity of Aivlosin 8.5 mg/g Oral Powder should be added to the estimated quantity of daily ration for each pig, in a bucket or similar receptacle, and thoroughly mixed.
13 The product should only be added to dry non-pelleted feed.

4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Good management and hygiene practices should be introduced to reduce the risk of re-infection.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Tylvalosin has been shown to cause hypersensitivity reactions in laboratory animals; therefore, people with known hypersensitivity to tylvalosin tartrate should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
17 When mixing the veterinary medicinal product and handling the medicated water, direct contact, with eyes, skin and mucous membranes should be avoided.
Personal protective equipment consisting of impervious gloves and a half-mask respirator conforming to European Standard EN 149 or a non- disposable respirator conforming to European Standard EN 140, with a filter conforming to European Standard EN 143 should be worn when mixing the veterinary medicinal product.
Wash contaminated skin.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
None known.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during lay.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
None known.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For use in drinking water.
For treatment of respiratory disease associated with Mycoplasma gallisepticum:
The dosage is 25 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day in drinking water for 3 consecutive days.
When used as an aid in the prevention strategy (where infection in ovum with Mycoplasma gallisepticum is likely):
The dosage is 25 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day in drinking water for 3 consecutive days at 1 day old.
This is followed by a second treatment with 25 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day in drinking water for 3 consecutive days at the period of risk, i.e. at times of management stress such as administration of vaccines (typically when birds are 2-3 weeks old).
Determine the combined bodyweight (in kg) of all the chickens to be treated.
Select the correct number of sachets according to the amount of product required.
One sachet of 40 g is sufficient to treat a total of 1000 kg of chickens (e.g.
20 000 birds with an average bodyweight of 50 g).
One sachet of 400 g is sufficient to treat a total of 10 000 kg of chickens (e.g.
20 000 birds with an average bodyweight of 500 g).
In order to achieve a correct dose, the preparation of a concentrated (stock) solution might be required (e.g. to treat a total of 500 kg total bird weight, only 50% of the prepared stock solution prepared from the 40 g sachet should be used).
The product should be added to a volume of water that the chickens will consume in one day.
No other source of drinking water should be available during the medication period.
18 Mixing instructions:
The product may be mixed directly into the drinking water system or first mixed as a stock solution into a smaller amount of water, which is then added into the drinking water system.
When mixing the product directly into the drinking water system, the contents of the sachet should be sprinkled onto the surface of the water and mixed thoroughly until a clear solution is produced (usually within 3 minutes).
When preparing a stock solution the maximum concentration should be 40 g per 1500 ml or 400 g of product per 15 litres and it is necessary to mix the solution for 10 minutes.
After this time, any remaining cloudiness will not affect efficacy of the product.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
No signs of intolerance have been observed in chickens at up to 150 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day for 5 days.
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Meat and offal:
2 days Not authorised for use in laying birds producing eggs for human consumption.
Do not use within 14 days of onset of the laying.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Macrolide antibiotic, ATC vet code:
QJ01FA92
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Tylvalosin is a macrolide antibiotic.
Macrolides are metabolites or derivatives of metabolites of soil organisms obtained by fermentation.
They interfere with protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 50S ribosome subunit.
They are generally considered bacteriostatic.
Tylvalosin has activity against pathogenic organisms isolated from a range of animal species - mainly gram positive organisms and mycoplasma but also some gram negative organisms.
Tylvalosin has activity against the following mycoplasma species found in chickens:
Mycoplasma gallisepticum.
The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of tylvalosin for M gallisepticum ranges from 0.007 to 0.25 µg/ml.
Macrolides (including tylvalosin) have been shown to have effects on the innate immune system, which may augment the direct effects of the antibiotic on the pathogen and aid the clinical situation.
Bacteria can develop resistance to antimicrobial substances.
The re are multiple mechanisms responsible for resistance development to macrolide compounds.
Cross-resistance within the macrolide group of antibiotics cannot be excluded.
Reduced susceptibility for tylvalosin was generally noted in tylosin resistant strains.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Tylvalosin tartrate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of the product.
Tylvalosin is widely distributed in tissues with the highest concentrations found in the respiratory tissues, bile, intestinal mucosa, spleen, kidney and liver.
19 Tylvalosin has been shown to concentrate in phagocytic cells and gut epithelial cells.
Concentrations (up to 12x) were achieved in the cells (intracellular), compared to the extracellular concentration.
In vivo studies have shown tylvalosin to be present in higher concentrations in the mucous lining of the respiratory and gut tissues compared to the plasma.
The major metabolite of tylvalosin is 3-acetyltylosin (3-AT), which is also microbiologically active.
The terminal half-lifes for the elimination of tylvalosin and its active metabolite 3-AT range from 1 to 1.45 hours.
Six hours after treatment, the concentration of tylvalosin in the gastrointestinal tract mucosa has a mean concentration of 133 ng/g and in the gastrointestinal contents of 1040 ng/g.
The active metabolite 3-AT has a mean concentration of 57.9 ng/g and 441 ng/g, respectively.

=
Daily feed intake (kg) x Premix strength (mg/g)
38 Acute cases and severely diseased pigs with reduced food and water intake should be treated with a suitable injectable product.
In addition to medical treatment, good management and hygiene practices should be established on the farm in order to reduce the risk of infection and to control the build up of resistance.
The medicated feed should be fed as the sole ration.

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
Because Aivlosin has been shown to cause hypersensitivity reactions in laboratory animals, people with known hypersensitivity to tylvalosin tartrate should avoid any contact with the product.
When mixing the veterinary medicinal product and handling the medicated feed, direct contact with eyes, skin and mucous membranes should be avoided.
Personal protective equipment should be worn when mixing the veterinary medicinal product or handling the medicated feed: overalls, impervious gloves and either a disposable half-mask respirator conforming to European Standard EN 149 or a non-disposable respirator conforming to European Standard EN 140, with a filter to EN 143.
Wash contaminated skin.
In case of accidental ingestion seek medical advice immediately and show the label to the physician.
39 The safety of Aivlosin during pregnancy and lactation has not been established in pigs.
Use only in accordance with risk/benefit assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
Studies in laboratory animals have not produced any evidence of teratogenicity.
Maternal toxicity in rodents has been observed at doses of 400 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight and above.
In mice, a slight reduction in the foetal bodyweight was seen at doses causing maternal toxicity.
Generally, strains of B. hyodysenteriae have higher MIC values in cases of resistance against other macrolides, such as tylosin.
The clinical relevance of this reduced susceptibility is not fully explored.
Cross-resistance between tylvalosin and other macrolides cannot be excluded.

* Important: these inclusion rates are assumes a pig eats equivalent of 5% bodyweight per day.
In older pigs, or in pigs with reduced appetite, or on restricted feed intake, inclusion levels may need to be increased to achieve target dosage.
Where feed intake is reduced, use the following formula:
Dose rate (mg/kg bodyweight) x bodyweight (kg)
Kg Premix/tonne feed
=
Daily feed intake (kg) x Premix strength (mg/g)
Acute cases and severely diseased pigs with reduced food and water intake should be treated with a suitable injectable product.
44 In addition to medical treatment, good management and hygiene practices should be established on the farm in order to reduce the risk of infection and to control the build up of resistance.
The medicated feed should be fed as the sole ration.
9.
ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
Mixing Instructions
A horizontal ribbon mixer should be used to incorporate the product into feeding stuff.
It is recommended that Aivlosin is first mixed with 10 kg of the feeding stuff, followed by the rest of the feeding stuff and mixed well.
Medicated feed may then be pelleted.
Pelleting conditions involve a single pre-conditioning step with steam for 5 minutes and pelleting at not more than 70°C under normal conditions.
No known incompatibilities.
10.
WITHDRAWAL PERIOD
Meat and offal:
Two days
11.
SPECIAL STORAGE CONDITIONS
Keep out of the reach and sight of children Do not store above 25°C Keep the container tightly closed.
Store in the original container Do not use after the expiry date stated on the label.
Shelf life after incorporation into feed:
Meal:
1 month Pellets:
2 weeks
12.
SPECIAL WARNING(S)
Because Aivlosin has been shown to cause hypersensitivity reactions in laboratory animals, people with known hypersensitivity to tylvalosin tartrate should avoid any contact with the product.
When mixing the veterinary medicinal product and handling the medicated feed, direct contact with eyes, skin and mucous membranes should be avoided.
Personal protective equipment should be worn when mixing the veterinary medicinal product or handling the medicated feed: overalls, impervious gloves and either a disposable half-mask respirator conforming to European Standard EN 149 or a non-disposable respirator conforming to European Standard EN 140, with a filter to EN 143.
Wash contaminated skin.
In case of accidental ingestion seek medical advice immediately and show the label to the physician.
The safety of Aivlosin during pregnancy and lactation has not been established in pigs.
Use only in accordance with risk/benefit assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
Studies in laboratory animals have not produced any evidence of teratogenicity.
Maternal toxicity in rodents has been observed at doses of 400 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight and above.
In mice, a slight reduction in the foetal bodyweight was seen at doses causing maternal toxicity.
45 Generally, strains of B. hyodysenteriae have higher MIC values in cases of resistance against other macrolides, such as tylosin.
The clinical relevance of this reduced susceptibility is not fully explored.
Cross-resistance between tylvalosin and other macrolides cannot be excluded.
13.
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS, IF ANY

DOSAGE FOR EACH SPECIES, ROUTE(S) AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
For use in drinking water.
For treatment of respiratory disease associated with Mycoplasma gallisepticum The dosage is 25 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day in drinking water for 3 consecutive days.
When used as an aid in the prevention strategy (where infection in ovum with Mycoplasma gallisepticum is likely):
The dosage is 25 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day in drinking water for 3 consecutive days at 1 day old.
This is followed by a second treatment with 25 mg tylvalosin per kg bodyweight per day in drinking water for 3 consecutive days at the period of risk, i.e. at times of management stress such as administration of vaccines (typically when birds are 2-3 weeks old).
Determine the combined bodyweight (in kg) of all the chickens to be treated.
Select the correct number of sachets according to the amount of product required.
One sachet of 40 g is sufficient for a total of 1000 kg of chickens (e.g.
20,000 birds with an average bodyweight of 50 g).
One sachet of 400 g is sufficient to treat a total of 10 000 kg of chickens (e.g.
20 000 birds with an average bodyweight of 500 g).
In order to achieve a correct dose, the preparation of a concentrated (stock) solution might be required (e.g. to treat a total of 500 kg total bird weight, only 50% of the prepared stock solution prepared from the 40 g sachet should be used).
The product should be added to a volume of water that the chickens will consume in one day.
No other source of drinking water should be available during the medication period.
9.
ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
The product may be mixed directly into the drinking water system or first mixed as a stock solution into a smaller amount of water, which is then added into the drinking water system.
When mixing the product directly into the drinking water system, the contents of the sachet should be sprinkled onto the surface of the water and mixed thoroughly until a clear solution is produced (usually within 3 minutes).
When preparing a stock solution the maximum concentration should be 40 g per 1500 ml or 400 g of product per 15 litres and it is necessary to mix the solution for 10 minutes.
After this time, any remaining cloudiness will not affect the efficacy of the veterinary medicinal product.
