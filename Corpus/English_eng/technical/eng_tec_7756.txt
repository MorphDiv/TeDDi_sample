Modifier to use for modified window click actions
Clicking a window while holding down this modifier key will move the window (left click), resize the window (middle click), or show the window menu (right click). The middle and right click operations may be swapped using the "resize-with-right-button" key. Modifier is expressed as <![CDATA["<Alt>"]]> or <![CDATA["<Super>"]]> for example.
Whether to resize with the right button
Set this to true to resize with the right button and show a menu with the middle button while holding down the key given in "mouse-button-modifier"; set it to false to make it work the opposite way around.
Arrangement of buttons on the titlebar
Arrangement of buttons on the titlebar. The value should be a string, such as "menu:minimize,maximize,spacer,close"; the colon separates the left corner of the window from the right corner, and the button names are comma-separated. Duplicate buttons are not allowed. Unknown button names are silently ignored so that buttons can be added in future metacity versions without breaking older versions. A special spacer tag can be used to insert some space between two adjacent buttons.
Window focus mode
The window focus mode indicates how windows are activated. It has three possible values; "click" means windows must be clicked in order to focus them, "sloppy" means windows are focused when the mouse enters the window, and "mouse" means windows are focused when the mouse enters the window and unfocused when the mouse leaves the window.
Control how new windows get focus
This option provides additional control over how newly created windows get focus. It has two possible values; "smart" applies the user's normal focus mode, and "strict" results in windows started from a terminal not being given focus.
Whether raising should be a side-effect of other user interactions
Setting this option to false can lead to buggy behavior, so users are strongly discouraged from changing it from the default of true. Many actions (e.g. clicking in the client area, moving or resizing the window) normally raise the window as a side-effect. Setting this option to false, which is strongly discouraged, will decouple raising from other user actions, and ignore raise requests generated by applications. See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=445447#c6. Even when this option is false, windows can still be raised by an alt-left-click anywhere on the window, a normal click on the window decorations, or by special messages from pagers, such as activation requests from tasklist applets. This option is currently disabled in click-to-focus mode. Note that the list of ways to raise windows when raise-on-click is false does not include programmatic requests from applications to raise windows; such requests will be ignored regardless of the reason for the request. If you are an application developer and have a user complaining that your application does not work with this setting disabled, tell them it is -their- fault for breaking their window manager and that they need to change this option back to true or live with the "bug" they requested.
Action on title bar double-click
This option determines the effects of double-clicking on the title bar. Current valid options are 'toggle-shade', which will shade/unshade the window, 'toggle-maximize' which will maximize/unmaximize the window, 'toggle-maximize-horizontally' and 'toggle-maximize-vertically' which will maximize/unmaximize the window in that direction only, 'minimize' which will minimize the window, 'shade' which will roll the window up, 'menu' which will display the window menu, 'lower' which will put the window behind all the others, and 'none' which will not do anything.
Action on title bar middle-click
This option determines the effects of middle-clicking on the title bar. Current valid options are 'toggle-shade', which will shade/unshade the window, 'toggle-maximize' which will maximize/unmaximize the window, 'toggle-maximize-horizontally' and 'toggle-maximize-vertically' which will maximize/unmaximize the window in that direction only, 'minimize' which will minimize the window, 'shade' which will roll the window up, 'menu' which will display the window menu, 'lower' which will put the window behind all the others, and 'none' which will not do anything.
Action on title bar right-click
This option determines the effects of right-clicking on the title bar. Current valid options are 'toggle-shade', which will shade/unshade the window, 'toggle-maximize' which will maximize/unmaximize the window, 'toggle-maximize-horizontally' and 'toggle-maximize-vertically' which will maximize/unmaximize the window in that direction only, 'minimize' which will minimize the window, 'shade' which will roll the window up, 'menu' which will display the window menu, 'lower' which will put the window behind all the others, and 'none' which will not do anything.
Automatically raises the focused window
If set to true, and the focus mode is either "sloppy" or "mouse" then the focused window will be automatically raised after a delay specified by the auto-raise-delay key. This is not related to clicking on a window to raise it, nor to entering a window during drag-and-drop.
Delay in milliseconds for the auto raise option
The time delay before raising a window if auto-raise is set to true. The delay is given in thousandths of a second.
Current theme
The theme determines the appearance of window borders, titlebar, and so forth.
Use standard system font in window titles
If true, ignore the titlebar-font option, and use the standard application font for window titles.
Window title font
A font description string describing a font for window titlebars. The size from the description will only be used if the titlebar-font-size option is set to 0. Also, this option is disabled if the titlebar-uses-desktop-font option is set to true.
Number of workspaces
Number of workspaces. Must be more than zero, and has a fixed maximum to prevent making the desktop unusable by accidentally asking for too many workspaces.
System Bell is Audible
Determines whether applications or the system can generate audible 'beeps'; may be used in conjunction with 'visual bell' to allow silent 'beeps'.
Enable Visual Bell
Turns on a visual indication when an application or the system issues a 'bell' or 'beep'; useful for the hard-of-hearing and for use in noisy environments.
Visual Bell Type
Tells the WM how to implement the visual indication that the system bell or another application 'bell' indicator has been rung. Currently there are two valid values, "fullscreen-flash", which causes a fullscreen white-black flash, and "frame-flash" which causes the titlebar of the application which sent the bell signal to flash. If the application which sent the bell is unknown (as is usually the case for the default "system beep"), the currently focused window's titlebar is flashed.
(Not implemented) Navigation works in terms of applications not windows
If true, then the WM works in terms of applications rather than windows. The concept is a bit abstract, but in general an application-based setup is more like the Mac and less like Windows. When you focus a window in application-based mode, all the windows in the application will be raised. Also, in application-based mode, focus clicks are not passed through to windows in other applications. Application-based mode is, however, largely unimplemented at the moment.
Disable misfeatures that are required by old or broken applications
Some applications disregard specifications in ways that result in window manager misfeatures. This option puts the WM in a rigorously correct mode, which gives a more consistent user interface, provided one does not need to run any misbehaving applications.
The names of the workspaces
Defines the names that should be assigned to workspaces. If the list is too long for the current number of workspaces, names in excess will be ignored. If the list is too short, or includes empty names, missing values will be replaced with the default ("Workspace N").
The locale to use for dates / numbers formats
Specify the locale to be used for displaying dates, times and numbers formats.
Proxy configuration mode
Select the proxy configuration mode. Supported values are "none", "manual", "auto". If this is "none", then proxies are not used. If it is "auto", the autoconfiguration URL described by the "autoconfig-url" key is used. If it is "manual", then the proxies described by "/system/proxy/http", "/system/proxy/https", "/system/proxy/ftp" and "/system/proxy/socks" will be used. Each of the 4 proxy types is enabled if its "host" key is non-empty and its "port" key is non-0. If an http proxy is configured, but an https proxy is not, then the http proxy is also used for https. If a SOCKS proxy is configured, it is used for all protocols, except that the http, https, and ftp proxy settings override it for those protocols only.
Automatic proxy configuration URL
URL that provides proxy configuration values. When mode is "auto", this URL is used to look up proxy information for all protocols.
Non-proxy hosts
This key contains a list of hosts which are connected to directly, rather than via the proxy (if it is active). The values can be hostnames, domains (using an initial wildcard like *.foo.com), IP host addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) and network addresses with a netmask (something like 192.168.0.0/24).
Unused; ignore
This key is not used, and should not be read or modified.
This key is not used; HTTP proxying is enabled when the host key is non-empty and the port is non-0.
HTTP proxy host name
The machine name to proxy HTTP through.
HTTP proxy port
The port on the machine defined by "/system/proxy/http/host" that you proxy through.
Authenticate proxy server connections
If true, then connections to the proxy server require authentication. The username/password combo is defined by "/system/proxy/http/authentication-user" and "/system/proxy/http/authentication-password". This applies only to the http proxy; when using a separate https proxy, there is currently no way to specify that it should use authentication.
HTTP proxy username
User name to pass as authentication when doing HTTP proxying.
HTTP proxy password
Password to pass as authentication when doing HTTP proxying.
Secure HTTP proxy host name
The machine name to proxy secure HTTP through.
Secure HTTP proxy port
The port on the machine defined by "/system/proxy/https/host" that you proxy through.
FTP proxy host name
The machine name to proxy FTP through.
FTP proxy port
The port on the machine defined by "/system/proxy/ftp/host" that you proxy through.
SOCKS proxy host name
The machine name to use as a SOCKS proxy.
SOCKS proxy port
The port on the machine defined by "/system/proxy/socks/host" that you proxy through.
