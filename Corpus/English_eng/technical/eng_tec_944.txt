MW made a cross-reference of &quot; XML Forms &quot; and made a two level entry of &quot; XForms &quot;
XML Form Documents (XForms)

.
Working with XForms
In %PRODUCTNAME, an XForms document is a special type of Writer document.
The Design Mode for an XForm document has additional toolbars and panes.
After you create and save an XForms document, you can open the document, fill out the form, and submit the changes to a server.
What's the role of UBL?
We do not officially support exporting to XHTML - but should be possible using XSLT
To Create a New XForms Document
File - New - XML Form Document
.
The XForms design window opens in an empty Writer document.
Design your form.
Insert a control, select the default model in the property browser, and enter a binding statement.
In the data navigator, add an element to the instance.
Load a new instance from an XML file and add controls to the relevant XML elements or attributes.
To Open an XForms Document
File - Open
and select the XForms document.
An XForm document has the same extension as a Writer text document (*.odt).
To Edit an XForms Document
Open the XForms document and use the following toolbars and windows:
Form Design toolbar
Form Controls toolbar
Data Navigator
Form Navigator
UFI: currently only StarOffice can render and evaluate our XForms docs.
Mozilla has announced a planned support recently.
There may be plugins for other browsers.
Should we tell the user?
