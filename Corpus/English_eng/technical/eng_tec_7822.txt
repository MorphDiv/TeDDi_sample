EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
YTTRIGA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Yttriga?
Yttriga is a radioactive liquid, which contains the active substance yttrium (90Y) chloride.
90Y, yttrium-90, is a radioactive form of the chemical element yttrium.
What is Yttriga used for?
Yttriga is used for radiolabelling.
Radiolabelling is a technique where a substance is tagged (labelled) with a radioactive compound.
In the case of Yttriga, the product is used to label medicines that have been specially developed for use with the active substance yttrium (90Y) chloride.
These medicines act as carrier to take the radioactivity to where it is needed.
These may be substances such as antibodies that have been designed to recognise a particular type of cells in the body, including tumour cells.
The effects of the medicine that is radiolabelled with Yttriga will be fully explained in its Package Leaflet.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Yttriga used?
Yttriga will only be handled and given by people who have experience in the safe handling of radioactive material.
Yttriga is never given on its own.
It must be mixed outside the body, usually in a laboratory, with the medicine that needs radiolabelling.
The yttrium-90 contained in Yttriga then attaches itself to the carrier medicine and the resulting mixture is given according to the Package Leaflet of the carrier medicine.
The quantity of Yttriga needed for radiolabelling and the dose of the radiolabelled medicine that is then given will depend on the medicine that is radiolabelled and the disease that is being treated.
How does Yttriga work?
The active substance in Yttriga, yttrium (90Y) chloride, is a radioactive compound.
It emits beta radiation.
The effect of Yttriga depends on the nature of the carrier medicine that is radiolabelled with Yttriga.
An example of its use is the treatment of some type of tumours, where the radiolabelled medicine carries the radioactivity to the site of a tumour.
Once there, the radioactivity from Yttriga helps to destroy the tumour.

As Yttriga is a ‘ precursor’ and will not be given on its own, no studies have been done in humans.
The company presented information from scientific articles already published on 90Y.
The company also presented published information showing the utility of 90Y to radiolabel other medicines, including one study of non-Hodgkin’ s lymphoma (a cancer of the lymph tissue, part of the immune system).
What benefit has Yttriga shown during the studies?
The information supplied by the company shows the utility of Yttriga as a precursor to radiolabel medicines with 90Y.
What is the risk associated with Yttriga?
As Yttriga is a precursor and will not be given on its own, it has no side effects.
Patients may experience side effects following the injection of a medicine radiolabelled with Yttriga.
These side effects will depend on the medicine being used, and they will be described in the Package Leaflet of the medicine labelled with Yttriga.
Yttriga is radioactive and its use may carry a risk of cancer and hereditary defects.
The doctor who prescribes Yttriga must ensure that the risks linked to the radioactive exposure are lower than the risks from the disease itself.
Yttriga must not be given directly to any patient.
Medicines radiolabelled with Yttriga should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to yttrium chloride or any of the other ingredients.
A medicine labelled with Yttriga should not be used in women who are or may be pregnant.
More information on the restrictions for the medicines radiolabelled with Yttriga will be given in the Package Leaflet of the medicine labelled with Yttriga.
Why has Yttriga been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Yttriga’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the for the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, which have been specifically developed and authorised for radiolabelling with this radionuclide.
They recommended that Yttriga be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Yttriga:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Yttriga to QSA Global GmbH on 19 January 2006.
