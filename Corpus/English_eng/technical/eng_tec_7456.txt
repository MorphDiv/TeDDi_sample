ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1/ 17 1.
NAME OF THE VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Nobivac Piro
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Per 1 ml dose:
Active substance:
606 (301-911) total antigenic mass units of soluble parasite antigen (SPA) from Babesia canis and Babesia rossi cultures
Adjuvant (in the solvent) 250 (225-275) µg saponin
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Lyophilisate and solvent for suspension for injection
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Dogs
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
For active immunisation of dogs of 6 months of age or older against Babesia canis to reduce the severity of clinical signs associated with acute Babesiosis (B. canis) and anaemia as measured by Packed Cell Volume (PCV).
Onset of immunity:
Three weeks after the basic vaccination course.
Duration of immunity:
6 months after the last (re-)vaccination.
4.3 Contra-indications
See section 4.7.
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
Only healthy dogs should be vaccinated.
In particular, chronic asymptomatic carriers should be identified and treated before vaccination, with substances that do not compromise immunological responsiveness.
It is recommended that vaccinations are given at least one month before the tick season.
As active babesia infection might interfere with the development of protective immunity, it is recommended to reduce exposure to ticks during the period of vaccination.
2/ 17 Currently there is only evidence of the efficacy of the vaccine against challenge with B. canis.
There is a possibility that vaccinated dogs facing a challenge with other babesia's may develop disease and require treatment.
Vaccination with Nobivac Piro does not prevent infection.
As a consequence a milder form of disease caused by B. canis can occur.
If mild babesia-like symptoms arise, which last for more than 2 days, veterinary advice should be sought.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Ensure that the lyophilisate is completely reconstituted before use.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package insert or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Commonly reported post-vaccination reactions are a diffuse swelling and/ or hardened nodule, accompanied by pain, at the site of vaccination.
In general this disappears within 4 days.
In rare cases, the reactions after the second dose of vaccine may remain for 14 days.
In addition, systemic signs, such as lethargy and a reduction in appetite may also commonly occur, sometimes accompanied by pyrexia and a stiff gait.
These reactions should disappear within 2-3 days.
4.7 Use during pregnancy and lactation
Do not use in pregnant or lactating bitches.
4.8 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the safety and efficacy of the concurrent use of this vaccine with any other.
It is therefore recommended that no other vaccines should be administered concurrently or simultaneously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Vaccination scheme:
Basic vaccination course:
First injection from 6 months of age, second injection 3 to 6 weeks later.
Revaccination:

Allow the solvent to reach room temperature (15 - 25°C).
Aseptically add the solvent to the lyophilisate.
Allow the lyophilisate to dissolve completely.
