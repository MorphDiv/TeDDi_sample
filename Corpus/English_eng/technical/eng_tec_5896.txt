Undo C++ name mangling for symbols
Description
demangle reads a list of C++ mangled symbol names from standard input and converts these names to human-readable form on standard output.
This utility is part of the & kde; Software Development Kit.
Example
Create a file called names containing the following mangled symbol names:
_ZNK6Object10metaObjectEv _ZN8QPtrListI5ArrowE5clearEv _ZTC4Kolf0_11KMainWindow
These names can then be demangled as follows:
example$ demangle & lt; names Object: :metaObject() const QPtrListlt; Arrowgt;: :clear() construction vtable for KMainWindow-in-Kolf
