Resize: The size of the picture will be increased by creating new areas to the right and/ or bottom (filled in with the background color) or decreased by cutting it at the right and/ or bottom. Scale: The picture will be expanded by duplicating pixels or squashed by dropping pixels. Smooth Scale: This is the same as Scale except that it blends neighboring pixels to produce a smoother looking picture.

Dots & Per Inch (DPI)

x
Vertical:
Dots Per Inch (DPI) specifies the number of pixels of the image that should be printed inside one inch (2.54cm). The higher the image's DPI, the smaller the printed image. Note that your printer is unlikely to produce high quality prints if you increase this to more than 300 or 600 DPI, depending on the printer. If you would like to print the image so that it is the same size as it is displayed on the screen, set the image's DPI values to be the same as the screen's. If either DPI value is Unspecified, the image will also be printed to be the same size as on the screen. Not all image formats support DPI values. If the format you save in does not support them, they will not be saved.
Offset
The Offset is the relative position where this image should be placed, compared to other images. Not all image formats support the Offset feature. If the format you save in does not support it, the values specified here will not be saved.

Text Fields provide extra information about the image. This is probably a comment area that you can freely write any text in. However, this is format-specific so the fields could theoretically be computer-interpreted data - that you should not modify - but this is unlikely. Not all image formats support Text Fields. If the format you save in does not support them, they will not be saved.

To select the foreground color that tools use to draw, left-click on a filled-in color cell. To select the background color, right-click instead. To change the color of a color cell itself, double-click on it. You can also swap the color of a filled-in cell with any other cell using drag and drop. Also, if you hold down the Ctrl key, the destination cell's color will be overwritten, instead of being swapped with the color of the source cell.

Color Similarity: %1% Click to configure.
Color Similarity: Exact Match Click to configure.
Color Similarity is how similar the colors of different pixels must be, for operations to consider them to be the same. If you set it to something other than Exact Match, you can work more effectively with dithered images and photos, in a comparable manner to the "Magic Wand" feature of other paint programs. This feature applies to: Selections: In Transparent mode, any color in the selection that is similar to the background color will be made transparent. Flood Fill: For regions with similar - but not identical - colored pixels, a higher setting is likely to fill more pixels. Color Eraser: Any pixel whose color is similar to the foreground color will be replaced with the background color. Autocrop and Remove Internal Border: For borders with similar - but not identical - colored pixels, a higher setting is more likely to crop the whole border. Higher settings mean that operations consider an increased range of colors to be sufficiently similar so as to be the same. Therefore, you should increase the setting if the above operations are not affecting pixels whose colors you consider to be similar enough. However, if they are having too much of an effect and are changing pixels whose colors you do not consider to be similar (e. g. if Flood Fill is changing too many pixels), you should decrease this setting. To configure it, click on the cube.

To acquire a screenshot, press %1. The screenshot will be placed into the clipboard and you will be able to paste it in KolourPaint. You may configure the Desktop Screenshot shortcut in the KDE System Settings module Keyboard Shortcuts. Alternatively, you may try the application KSnapshot.
You do not appear to be running KDE. Once you have loaded KDE: To acquire a screenshot, press %1. The screenshot will be placed into the clipboard and you will be able to paste it in KolourPaint. Alternatively, you may try the application KSnapshot.
Acquiring Screenshots
The image to be pasted may have more colors than the current screen mode can support. In order to display it, some color information may be removed. If you save this image, any color loss will become permanent. To avoid this issue, increase your screen depth to at least %1bpp and then restart KolourPaint. It also contains translucency which is not fully supported. The translucency data will be approximated with a 1-bit transparency mask. If you save this image, this loss of translucency will become permanent.
