Calculating With Dates and Times
In $[officename] Calc, you can perform calculations with current date and time values.
As an example, to find out exactly how old you are in seconds or hours, follow the following steps:
In a spreadsheet, enter your birthday in cell A1.
=NOW()-A1
Enter
key you will see the result in date format.
Since the result should show the difference between two dates as a number of days, you must format cell A3 as a number.
Format Cells
.
Format Cells
dialogue box appears.
On the
Numbers
tab, the &quot; Number &quot; category will appear already highlighted.
The format is set to &quot; General &quot; , which causes the result of a calculation containing date entries to be displayed as a date.
To display the result as a number, set the number format to &quot; -1,234 &quot; and close the dialogue box with the
OK
button.
The number of days between today's date and the specified date is displayed in cell A3.
Enter
key after each formula.
Enter
key.
This value is not automatically updated, although &quot; Now &quot; continuously changes.
In the
Tools
menu, the menu item
Cell Contents - AutoCalculate
is normally active; however, automatic calculation does not apply to the function NOW.
This ensures that your computer is not solely occupied with updating the sheet.
