Axes
Specifies the axes to be displayed in the chart.
Major axis
x-Axis
Displays the x-axis as a line with subdivisions.
y-Axis
Displays the y-axis as a line with subdivisions.
z-Axis
Displays the z-axis as a line with subdivisions.
This axis can only be displayed in 3-D charts.
Secondary axis
Use this area to assign a second axis to your chart.
If a data series is already assigned to this axis, $[officename] automatically displays the axis and the label.
You can turn off these settings later on.
If no data has been assigned to this axis and you activate this area, the values of the primary y-axis are applied to the secondary axis.
x-Axis
Displays a secondary x-axis in the chart.
y-Axis
Displays a secondary y-axis in the chart.
The major axis and the secondary axis can have different scaling.
For example, you can scale one axis to 6 cm. and the other to 4.5 cm.
