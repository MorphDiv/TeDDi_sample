Configuring & kspread; Shortcuts and Toolbars
Shortcuts
To change the shortcut key arrangements used by & kspread; select Settings Configure Shortcuts.... This will launch a dialog box as shown below.
Shortcut config screenshot 1
Search through the list box to find the action you want to add or change the shortcut keys for and select it by left clicking on the name. By entering the name of the action in the search bar at the top you can quickly find the desired action. You will then be able to change the shortcut by selecting the None, Default or Custom radio button or by clicking on the large button in the Shortcut for Selected Action area.
The Configure Shortcut dialog box will then open.
Simple shortcut configuration
You can now simply press the key combination you want to act as the shortcut, for example & Ctrl; Shift; S. The Configure Shortcut dialog box will then close by itself as soon as the shortcut is configured.
Advanced shortcut configuration
You can also click on the Advanced & gt; gt; button in the Configure Shortcut dialog to get more options. There you can configure a Primary shortcut: and a secondary Alternate shortcut:. You can even choose Multi-key mode, which lets you add additional keys to the shortcut.
Configuring the shortcut with the simple dialog sets the primary shortcut.
User Defined Menus
You can add your own pop up menu to & kspread; so that pressing one key combination will make the menu appear then pressing a second key, or using the Up arrow and Down arrow keys and pressing Enter, will select an item from it.
To do this add a Custom shortcut for each of the actions you want to appear in the menu and in the Configure Shortcut dialog check the Multi-key mode box, press the key combination that you want to bring up your new menu then, separately, press the key that will choose that item from the menu.
Toolbars
& kspread; has five toolbars: File, Edit, Navigation, Format and Color/ Border. each of which may or may not be shown depending on the choices made in the Settings menu.
You can choose whether a toolbar appears at the Top, Left, Right or Bottom of & kspread; 's window by right clicking on the toolbar, which brings up the Toolbar Menu, and making a selection from the Orientation sub menu. This Toolbar Menu also has sub menus for choosing whether the toolbar displays icons, text or both, and the size of the icons.
Another way of moving a toolbar is by positioning the mouse pointer over the two vertical bars at the left end of each toolbar and holding the left mouse button down while you drag the toolbar to the wanted position. When you drag the toolbar in this way you can release the mouse button when it is some distance from any of & kspread; 's window sides, and then you will get a floating toolbar, which is not locked to any particular part of & kspread; 's window and can in fact be moved outside of the window. To put a floating toolbar back into one of the traditional positions right click on its titlebar to bring up the Toolbar Menu then choose one of the options in the Orientation sub menu.
You can also flatten a toolbar by left clicking on the two vertical bars at the left end of the toolbar or by selecting Orientation Flat from the Toolbar Menu. A flattened toolbar appears as a small rectangle containing two horizontal bars just under & kspread; 's Menubar. It can be restored to normal by left clicking on it.
Selecting Configure Toolbars... from the Settings menu will bring up a dialog box which lets you add buttons to or remove them from & kspread; 's toolbars.
To use this Configure Toolbars dialog box first select a toolbar from the Toolbar: combo box. The right hand Current actions: window will then show the buttons currently present on the toolbar. You can remove a button by selecting it in this window then pressing the left arrow button, or move it around by pressing the up and down arrow buttons. To add a new button to the toolbar select it in the Available actions: list then press the right arrow button.
