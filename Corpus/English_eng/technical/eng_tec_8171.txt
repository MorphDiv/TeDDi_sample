EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
OPTISULIN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Optisulin?
Optisulin is a clear solution for injection containing the active substance insulin glargine.
It is supplied in vials or as cartridges.
What is Optisulin used for?
Optisulin is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six years or older with diabetes mellitus, when they need insulin.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Optisulin used?
Optisulin is given by injection under the skin in the abdominal wall (tummy), the thigh, or the deltoid region (shoulder).
The site of injection should be changed with each injection to avoid changes to the skin (such as thickening) that can make the insulin work less well than expected.
The patient ’ s blood glucose (sugar) should be regularly tested to find the lowest effective dose.
Optisulin is given once daily at any time during the day provided that it is the same time each day.
This should be in the evening when used in children.
Optisulin can also be given together with anti-diabetes medicines taken by mouth in patients who have non-insulin-dependent diabetes (type 2 diabetes).
How does Optisulin work?
Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of glucose in the blood or when the body is unable to use insulin effectively.
Optisulin is a replacement insulin that is very similar to the insulin made by the pancreas.
The active substance in Optisulin, insulin glargine, is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a bacterium that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce insulin glargine.
Insulin glargine is very slightly different from human insulin.
The change means that it is absorbed more slowly and regularly by the body after an injection, and that it has a long duration of action.
The replacement insulin acts in same way as naturally produced insulin and helps glucose enter cells from the blood.
By controlling blood glucose levels, the symptoms and complications of diabetes are reduced.

How has Optisulin been studied?
Optisulin was originally studied in 10 studies, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
A total of 2,106 patients received Optisulin in all trials combined.
The main studies compared Optisulin given once a day at bedtime with human insulin NPH (an intermediate-acting insulin) given once or twice a day.
Injections of fast-acting insulin were also used at mealtimes.
In one study, patients with type 2 diabetes also received anti-diabetes medicines by mouth.
Further studies were carried out to compare Optisulin and human insulin NPH in children and adolescents aged between five and 18 years, 200 of whom received Optisulin.
Studies were also carried out in nearly 1,400 adult patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes to measure the effectiveness of Optisulin injected at any time during the day, compared with an evening injection.
All of the studies measured the level of ‘ fasting’ blood glucose (measured after not eating for at least eight hours) or of a substance in the blood called glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well blood glucose is controlled.
What benefit has Optisulin shown during the studies?
Optisulin led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c, indicating that blood glucose levels had been controlled to a similar level to that seen with human insulin.
Optisulin was effective for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
However, there were too few children aged below six years to determine the medicine ’ s effectiveness in this group.
The effectiveness of Optisulin was seen regardless of the time of the injection.
What is the risk associated with Optisulin?
The most common side effect seen with Optisulin (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) is hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels).
Reactions at the site of the injection (redness, pain, itching and swelling) have been seen more often in children than in adults.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Optisulin, see the Package Leaflet.
Optisulin should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin glargine or to any of the other ingredients.
Optisulin doses might also need to be adjusted when given with some other medicines that may have an effect on blood glucose levels.
The full list is available in the Package Leaflet.
Why has Optisulin been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Optisulin’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children of six years or above with diabetes mellitus, where treatment with insulin is required.
The Committee recommended that Optisulin be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Optisulin:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Optisulin to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH on 27 June 2000.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 27 June 2005.
