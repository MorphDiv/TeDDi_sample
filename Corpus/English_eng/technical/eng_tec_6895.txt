KDE
KDebugdialog
What is & kdebugdialog;?
It is a dialog box for managing diagnostic messages at runtime.
If you simply start kdebugdialog, you will see a list of areas, that can be disabled or enabled. A kDebug(area) call in the code will show something in the debug output only if the area is enabled.
Note that kWarning, kError and kFatal always appear, they are NOT controlled by this setting.
Area
The areas which should only be output. Every message that is not mentioned here will simply not be output (unless this field remains empty, which is the default, and means that all messages should be output). You can enter several areas separated by commas here, and you can also use area ranges with the syntax start-end. Thus a valid entry could be: 117,214-289,356-359,221. Do not use whitespaces.
If you start kdebugdialog --fullmode, then for every severity level you can define separately what should be done with the diagnostic messages of that level, and the same for each debug area.
In full mode, first you should select the debug area you are interested in from the drop down box at the top.
You may independently set the output for various types of messages:
Information
Warning
Error
Fatal Error
For each of these types, you can set the following:
Output to:
In this Combobox, you can choose where the messages should be output. The choices are: File, Message Box, Shell (meaning stderr) and Syslog. Please do not direct fatal messages to syslog unless you are the system administrator yourself. The default is Message Box.
Filename:
This is only enabled when you have chosen File as the output and provides the name of that file (which is interpreted as relative to the current folder). The default is kdebug. dbg.
Apart from this, you can also tick the check box Abort on fatal errors. In this case, if a diagnostic message with the severity level KDEBUG_FATAL is output, the application aborts with a SIGABRT after outputting the message.
When you close the dialog by pressing OK, your entries apply immediately and are saved in kdebugrc. When you press Cancel, your entries are discarded and the old ones are restored.
