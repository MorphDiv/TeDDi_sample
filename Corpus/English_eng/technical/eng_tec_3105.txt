(PHP 4)
The highlight_file() function prints out a syntax higlighted version of the code contained in filename using the colors defined in the built-in syntax highlighter for PHP.
If the second parameter return is set to TRUE then highlight_file() If the second parameter return is set to TRUE then highlight_file() will return the highlighted code as a string instead of printing it out.
If the second parameter is not set to TRUE then highlight_file() will return TRUE on success, FALSE on failure.
Note:
The return parameter became available in PHP 4.2.0.
Before this time it behaved like the default, which is FALSE
Note:
Care should be taken when using the show_source() and highlight_file() functions to make sure that you do not inadvertently reveal sensitive information such as passwords or any other type of information that might create a potential security risk.
Note:
Since PHP 4.2.1 this function is also affected by safe_mode and open_basedir.
Example 1.
Creating a source highlighting URL
To setup a URL that can code hightlight any script that you pass to it, we will make use of the "ForceType" directive in Apache to generate a nice URL pattern, and use the function highlight_file() to show a nice looking code list.
In your httpd.conf you can add the following:
Location / source ForceType application / x-httpd-php / Location
And then make a file named "source" and put it in your web root directory.
HTML HEAD TITLE Source Display / TITLE / HEAD BODY BGCOLOR=" white "?php $script = getenv ("PATH_TRANSLATED"); if(!$script) {echo" BR B ERROR:
Script Name needed / B BR ";} else {if (ereg("(\.php|\.inc)$",$script)) {echo" H1 Source of: $PATH_INFO / H1 \n HR \n"; highlight_file($script);} else {echo "H1 ERROR:
Only PHP or include script names are allowed / H1 ";}} echo" HR Processed: ".date("Y / M/d H:i:s",time());? / BODY / HTML
Then you can use an URL like the one below to display a colorized version of a script located in "/ path / to / script.php" in your web site.
http: / /your.server.com / source / path / to / script.php
