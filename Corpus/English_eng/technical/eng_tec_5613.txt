Valgrind Output
Valgrind Shows the output of valgrind. Valgrind detects: use of uninitialized memory; reading/ writing memory after it has been free'd; reading/ writing off the end of malloc'd blocks; reading/ writing inappropriate areas on the stack; memory leaks & mdash; where pointers to malloc'd blocks are lost forever; passing of uninitialised and/ or unaddressable memory to system calls; mismatched use of malloc/ new/ new [] vs free/ delete/ delete []; some abuses of the POSIX pthread API.
