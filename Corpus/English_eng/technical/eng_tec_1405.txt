Calculate
Defines the calculation settings for spreadsheets.
Defines the behaviour of spreadsheets with iterative references, the date settings, the number of decimal places, and if capitalisation or lower cases are to be considered when searching within sheets.
Iterative references
In this section you can delimit the number of approximation steps carried out during iterative calculations.
In addition, you can specify the degree of precision of the answer.
Iterations
Specifies whether formulae with iterative references (formulae that are continuously repeated until the problem is solved) are calculated after a specific number of repetitions.
If the
Iterations
box is not marked, an iterative reference in the table will cause an error message.
Example:
Calculating the cost of an item without the value-added tax.
Type the text 'Selling price' in cell A5, the text 'Net' in cell A6, and the text 'Value-added tax' in cell A7.
Now type a selling price (for example, 100) in cell B5.
The net price should be shown in cell B6 and the value-added tax should be shown in cell B7.
=B5-B7
in B6 to calculate the net price, and type the formula
=B6*0.175
in cell B7 to calculate the value-added tax.
Status
Bar.
A
B
5
Selling Price
100
6
Net
=B5-B7
7
Tax
=B6*0,15
Steps
Sets the maximum number of iteration steps.
Minimum Change
Specifies the difference between two consecutive iteration step results.
If the result of the iteration is lower than the minimum change value, then the iteration will stop.
Date
Select the start date for the internal conversion from days to numbers.
30/12/1899 (default)
Sets 12/30/1899 as day zero.
01/01/1900 (StarCalc 1.0)
Sets 01/01/1900 as day zero.
Use this setting for StarCalc 1.0 spreadsheets containing date entries.
01/01/1904
Sets 01/01/1904 as day zero.
Use this setting for spreadsheets that are imported in a foreign format.
Case sensitive
Specifies whether to distinguish between upper and lower case in texts when comparing cell contents.
Example:
Type the text 'Test' in cell A1; and the text 'test' in B1.
Then type the formula &quot; =A1=B1 &quot; in cell C1.
If the
Case sensitive
box is marked, FALSE will appear in the cell; otherwise, TRUE will appear in the cell.
The EXACT text function is always case-sensitive, independent of the settings in this dialogue box.
Decimal places
Standard
number format.
The numbers are displayed as rounded numbers, but are not saved as rounded numbers.
Precision as shown
Precision as shown
option is not marked, the displayed numbers are rounded, but they are calculated internally using the non-rounded number.

Search criteria = and < > must apply to whole cells
box is marked, $[officename] Calc behaves exactly as Microsoft Excel when searching cells in the database functions.
.* in following position:
Search result:

Finds win, but not win95, os2win, or upwind
win.*
Finds win and win95, but not os2win or upwind

Finds win and os2win, but not win95 or upwind

Search criteria = and < > must apply to whole cells
is not enabled, the &quot; win &quot; search pattern acts like &quot; .*win.* &quot; .
The search pattern can be at any position within the cell when searching with the Calc database functions.
Enable regular expressions in formulae
Specifies that regular expressions are enabled when searching and also for character string comparisons.
database functions
, and to VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP and SEARCH.
Automatically find column and row labels
Specifies that you can use the text in any cell as a label for the column below the text or the row to the right of the text.
The text must consist of at least one word and must not contain any operators.
Example:
Cell E5 contains the text &quot; Europe &quot; .
Below, in cell E6, is the value 100 and in cell E7 the value 200.
If the
Automatically find column and row labels
box is marked, you can write the following formula in cell A1: =SUM(Europe).
