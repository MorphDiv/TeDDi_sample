Find Record
Searches database tables and forms.
In forms or database tables, you can search through data fields, list boxes, and check boxes for specific values.
When searching a table, the data fields of the current table are searched.
When searching in a form, the data fields of the table linked with the form are searched.
%PRODUCTNAME
.
If you want to use the SQL server to search in a database, then you should use the
Form-based Filters
icon on the
Form Bar
.
The search function is also available for table controls.
When calling the search function from a table control, you can search each column of the table control corresponding to the database columns of the linked database table.
Search for
Specifies the type of search.
Text:
Enter the search term in the box or select it from the list.
The text under the cursor is already copied into the
Text
combo box.
Note that while running a search in a form, tabs and line breaks cannot be processed.
Your search terms will be saved as long as the table or the formula document is open.
If you are running more than one search and you would like to repeat the search term, you can select a previously used search term from the combo box.
Field content is NULL
Specifies that fields will be found that contain no data.
Field content is not NULL
Specifies that fields will be found that contain data.
Where to search
Specifies the fields for the search.
Form
Specifies the logical form in which you want the search to take place.
Form
combo box is only visible if the current document is a form document with more than one logical form.
It does not appear during a search in tables or queries.
Form documents may contain multiple logical forms.
These are individual form components, which are each linked to a table.
Form
combo box contains the names of all logical forms for which controls exist.
All Fields
Searches through all fields.
If you are running a search in a table, all fields in the table will be searched.
If you are running a search in a form, all fields of the logical form (entered under
Form
) will be searched.
If you are running a search in a table control field, all columns that are linked to a valid database table field will be searched.
All Fields
option will only search for the fields linked to data sources in the form document.
Single field
Searches through a specified data field.
Settings
Defines settings to control the search.
Position
Specifies the relationship of the search term and the field contents.
The following options are available:
anywhere in the field
Returns all fields containing the search pattern anywhere in the field.
beginning of field
Returns all fields containing the search pattern at the beginning of the field.
end of field
Returns all fields containing the search pattern at the end of the field.
entire field
Returns all fields containing the search pattern as an exact match to the contents of the field.
Wildcard expression
check box is marked, this function is not available.
Apply field format
Specifies that all field formats are considered when searching in the current document.
Field formats are all visible formats that are created using the following possibilities:
in table design mode for field properties,
in data source view on column formatting,
in forms on control properties.
Apply field format
check box is marked, the data source view of the table or form is searched using the formatting set there.
If the check box is not marked, the database is searched using the formatting saved in the database.
Example:
Apply field format
option is on:
Apply field format
Search Pattern
on
&quot; Feb &quot; is returned, but not &quot; 2 &quot; .
off
&quot; 2 &quot; is returned, but not &quot; Feb &quot; .
It is recommended that you always search using field formatting.
The following examples show possible issues when searching without field formatting.
These issues depend on the database used and only occur for certain internal default formatting:
Search Results
Cause
&quot; 5 &quot; returns &quot; 14:00:00 &quot; as a time
Time fields are not defined for dBASE databases and must be simulated.
To internally display the time &quot; 14:00:00 &quot; , a 5 is necessary.
&quot; 00:00:00 &quot; returns all records of a standard date field
The database stores a date value internally using a combined date/time field.
entire field
option is selected under
Position
.
The view shown does not match what is stored internally.
For example, if value 45.789 is stored in the database as a field of type Number/Double and the shown formatting is set to display only two decimals, &quot; 45.79 &quot; is only returned in searches with field formatting.
In this case, standard formatting is formatting that refers to the internally stored data.
It is not always visible to the user, especially if it is used for simulating data types (for example, time fields in dBASE databases).
This depends on the database used and the individual data type.
Searching with field formatting is appropriate if you only want to find what is actually shown.
This includes fields of type Date, Time, Date/Time and Number/Double.
Apply field format
is appropriate for larger databases with no formatting issues, because it is faster.
Apply field format
is on, then you will receive a &quot; 1 &quot; for marked check boxes, a &quot; 0 &quot; for unmarked check boxes, and an empty string for undefined (tri-state) check boxes.
If the search has been carried out with
Apply field format
set to off, you will see the language-dependent default values &quot; TRUE &quot; or &quot; FALSE &quot; .
Apply field format
when searching in list boxes, you find the text displayed in list boxes.
If you do not use
Apply field format
, you will find the contents corresponding to the standard field format.
Match case
Specifies that upper and lower case are taken into consideration during the search.
Search backwards
Specifies that the search process will run in reverse direction, from the last to the first record.
From top / From bottom
Restarts the search.
A forwards search restarts with the first record.
A backwards search restarts with the last record.
Wildcard expression
Allows a search with a * or ? wildcard.
You can use the following wildcards:
Wildcards
Meaning
Example
?
for exactly one arbitrary character
&quot; ?loppy &quot; returns &quot; Floppy &quot;
&quot; M?ller &quot; returns, for example, Miller and Moller
*
for 0 or more arbitrary characters
&quot; *-* &quot; returns &quot; ZIP-Drive &quot; and &quot; CD-ROM &quot;
&quot; M*er &quot; returns all entries starting with an &quot; M &quot; and ending in &quot; er &quot; (for example, Miller, Moller, Mather)
Wildcard expression
is enabled.
When the option is not enabled, the wildcard characters are processed like normal characters.
Regular expression
Searches with regular expressions.
The same regular expressions that are supported here are also supported in the
%PRODUCTNAME
Find & Replace dialogue box
.
Searching with regular expressions offers more options than searching with wildcard expressions.
If you search with regular expressions, the following characters correspond to those used in searches with wildcards:
Search with wildcard expression
Search with regular expressions
?
.
*
.*
State
State
line shows the records returned by the search.
If the search reaches the end (or the beginning) of a table, the search is automatically continued at the other end.
In very large databases, finding the record in reverse search order can take some time.
In this case, the status bar informs you that the records are still being counted.
Search / Cancel
Starts or cancels the search.
If the search is successfully completed, the corresponding field in the table is highlighted.
You can continue the search by clicking the
Search
button again.
You can cancel a search process by clicking the
Cancel
button.
Close
%PRODUCTNAME
.
If several tables or forms are open, you can set different search options for each document.
When you close the documents only the search options of the document last closed are saved.
