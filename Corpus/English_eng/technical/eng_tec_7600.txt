Active substance Ibafloxacin 30 mg Ibafloxacin 150 mg Ibafloxacin 300 mg Ibafloxacin 900 mg
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Tablet
4.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
4.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterial quinolone ATCvet code:
QJ 01 MA Ibaflin contains ibafloxacin as active ingredient.
Ibafloxacin is a synthetic antimicrobial substance of the fluoroquinolone class.
Ibafloxacin is a broad spectrum, bactericidal antibiotic.
Its action results from inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase.
The most abundant metabolite is 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin, which is also microbiologically active.
Ibafloxacin and 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin act synergystically.
For ibafloxacin (parent compound), MIC values ranging from 0.032 – 0.5 µg/ ml are observed for canine isolates of E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, strains of Pasteurella spp. and Salmonella spp.
A strain which is resistant to a fluoroquinolone will also be resistant to other members of the class of fluoroquinolones.
4.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
After oral administration in dogs, ibafloxacin is rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma levels of microbiologically active compounds obtained at 1-2 hours after administration.
Terminal plasma half- life is approximately 4-5 hours.
Ibaflin can be administered at any time of the day without consequences for efficacy.
However, it is preferred to administer the tablet at feeding time to ensure maximal bioavailability.
The main excretory route is via urine and faeces.
After multiple oral administration, steady state is reached after the first or second dosing and no accumulation or induction of biotransformation enzymes occurs.
5.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
5.1 Target species
Dogs
2/ 42 5.2 Indications for use
Ibaflin is indicated for the treatment of the following conditions in dogs:
Dermal infections (pyoderma – superficial and deep, wounds, abscesses) caused by susceptible strains of Staphylococci, E. coli, and Proteus mirabilis.
Acute, uncomplicated urinary tract infections, caused by susceptible strains of Staphylococci, Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., E. coli and Klebsiella spp.
Respiratory tract infections (upper tract) caused by susceptible strains of Staphylococci, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp.
5.3 Contra-indications
Do not use in dogs during the period of growth as articular cartilage may be affected.
This period depends on the breed.
For the majority of breeds the use of ibafloxacin is contra-indicated in dogs less than 8 months of age and in giant breeds less than 18 months.
Do not use in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in dogs with a history of seizures.
5.4 Undesirable effects
Diarrhoea, soft faeces, vomiting, dullness and anorexia have been observed with low frequency.
These effects were mild and transient.
5.5 Special precautions for use
Heavy reliance on a single class of antibiotic may result in the induction of resistance in a bacterial population.
It is prudent to reserve the fluoroquinolones for the treatment of clinical conditions which have responded poorly, or are expected to respond poorly, to other classes of antibiotic.
Ibaflin should only be used based on susceptibility testing.
Do not use in dogs with known quinolone hypersensitivity.
Pyoderma is mostly secondary to an underlying disease.
It is advisable to determine the underlying cause and to treat the animal accordingly.
5.6 Use during pregnancy and lactation
Can be used during pregnancy.
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during lactation.
The influence on fertility in male breeding dogs has not been studied.
5.7 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Fluoroquinolones should not be used in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in dogs with a history of seizures.
Antacids can interfere with gastro-intestinal absorption of quinolones.
Antagonism may be observed with nitrofurantoin.
5.8 Posology and method of administration
Oral use, 15 mg ibafloxacin/ kg once daily.
The duration of treatment depends on the nature and severity of the infection and on the response.
In most cases, a 10-day treatment course will be sufficient.
If necessary and depending on the clinical response, treatment can be continued until the response is considered to be adequate.
The treatment should be reconsidered if at 5 days no improvement in the clinical condition is observed.
If in cases of deep pyoderma, sufficient improvement is not seen after a treatment course of 21 days, it is recommended that the treatment is reconsidered.
3/ 42 To ensure a correct dosage body weight should be determined as accurately as possible to avoid underdosing.
The following dosage scheme is advised:
Body weight (kg)
Dosage (number of tablets)
mg administered
1 2 3 4 5 6-10 11-15 16-20 21-30 31-40 41-60
Ibaflin 30 mg Ibaflin 150 mg 0.5 1 1.5 2 0.5 1 1.5
Ibaflin 300mg 1 2
Ibaflin mg 0.5 1
900
15 30 45 60 75 150 225 300 450 600 900
5.9 Overdose
Target animal safety studies in dogs of 8 months of age demonstrated that, when administered orally at 45 mg/ kg/ day (three times the recommended dose) for a period of 90 days, ibafloxacin produced no observable adverse effects.
No specific antidotes for ibafloxacin (or other quinolones) are known, therefore, in case of overdosage symptomatic treatment should be given.
5.10 Special warnings for each target species

OTHER INFORMATION
For animal treatment only.
Medicinal advice should be sought in the event of accidental ingestion, particularly by a child.
Ibafloxacin is a broad spectrum bactericidal antibiotic from the quinolone group.
Its action results from inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase.
After oral administration in dogs, ibafloxacin is rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma levels of microbiologically active compounds obtained at 1-2 hours after administration.
Terminal plasma half-life is approximately 4-5 hours.
The main excretory route is via urine and faeces.
After multiple oral administration, steady state is reached after the first or second dosing and no accumulation or induction of biotransformation enzymes occurs.
Target animal safety studies in beagle dogs of 8 months of age demonstrated that, when administered orally at 45 mg/ kg/ day (three times the recommended dose) for a period of 90 days, ibafloxacin produced no observable adverse effects.

OTHER INFORMATION
For animal treatment only.
Ibafloxacin is a synthetic antimicrobial substance of the fluoroquinolone class.
Ibafloxacin is a broad spectrum antibiotic with bactericidal action resulting from inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase.
The most abundant metabolite is 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin, which is also microbiologically active. lbafloxacin and 8- hydroxy-ibafloxacin act synergistically.
For ibafloxacin (parent compound), MIC values ranging from 0.032 – 0.5 µg/ ml are observed for canine isolates of E. coli, Staphylococcus spp. and Proteus mirabilis.
In cats, relevant susceptible micro-organisms are E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., Pasteurella spp., Proteus spp. and Klebsiella spp.
(MIC ≤ 0.5 µg ibafloxacin/ ml).
After oral administration in cats, ibafloxacin is rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma levels observed at 1 hour when administered without food and 2 hours when administered with food.
In dogs the maximum plasma levels were observed at 2 hours when administered with or without food.
Terminal plasma half- life is approximately 3-5 hours.
The overall absorption was higher in dogs and cats when administered with food.
The gel should therefore be administered at feeding time to ensure maximal bioavailability.
The main excretory routes are via urine and faeces.
After multiple oral administration, steady state is reached after the first dosing and no accumulation occurs in dogs whereas modest accumulation is observed in cats.
When administered orally at 75 mg/ kg/ day (five times the recommended dose) for a period of 90 days in dogs, ibafloxacin was well tolerated.
When administered over a period of 30 days to healthy cats, Ibaflin oral gel produced vomiting/ regurgitation and salivation at doses of 15 to 75 mg/ kg.
