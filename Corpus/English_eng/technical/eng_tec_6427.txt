Introduction
What is & kappname;
& kappname; is a fast and easy to use image viewer for KDE.
Gwenview features three main modes: Browse, View, and Full Screen. Browse Mode lets you navigate through your computer showing thumbnails of your images, View Mode lets you view images one at a time, and Full Screen lets you make quick slideshows.
Image loading is handled by the Qt library, so & kappname; supports all image formats your Qt installation supports. & kappname; correctly displays images with an alpha channel (transparency) as well as animations.
& kappname; supports the displaying and editing of EXIF comments in JPEG images. Lossless JPEG transforms such as rotations and mirroring are also supported.
It features a folder tree window and a file list window to provide easy navigation of your file hierarchy. & kappname; uses docked windows, so you can alter its layout any way you wish. You can also browse your images in full-screen mode, or embedded within & konqueror; using the Image View and Kpart.
