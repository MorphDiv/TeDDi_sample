(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
Sets the element handler functions for the XML parser parser. start_element_handler and end_element_handler are strings containing the names of functions that must exist when xml_parse() is called for parser.
The function named by start_element_handler must accept three parameters: start_element_handler (resource parser, string name, array attribs)
The first parameter, parser, is a reference to the XML parser calling the handler.
The second parameter, name, contains the name of the element for which this handler is called.
If case-folding is in effect for this parser, the element name will be in uppercase letters.
The third parameter, attribs, contains an associative array with the element' s attributes (if any).
The keys of this array are the attribute names, the values are the attribute values.
Attribute names are case-folded on the same criteria as element names.
Attribute values are not case-folded.
The original order of the attributes can be retrieved by walking through attribs the normal way, using each().
The first key in the array was the first attribute, and so on.
The function named by end_element_handler must accept two parameters: end_element_handler (resource parser, string name)
The first parameter, parser, is a reference to the XML parser calling the handler.
The second parameter, name, contains the name of the element for which this handler is called.
If case-folding is in effect for this parser, the element name will be in uppercase letters.
If a handler function is set to an empty string, or FALSE, the handler in question is disabled.
TRUE is returned if the handlers are set up, FALSE if parser is not a parser.
Note:
Instead of a function name, an array containing an object reference and a method name can also be supplied.
