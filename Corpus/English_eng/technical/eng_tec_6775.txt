Monthly Statistics
If this is checked, you will have much greater control over how KNemo handles monthly statistics. You can set different start dates and make billing periods span 1 - 6 months. If you uncheck this option, KNemo will recalculate all billing periods as monthly statistics.
Custom billing periods
Billing start date:
By default, this shows the start date of the current month or billing period. If you change the date, KNemo will recalculate billing periods from that date forward. Any billing periods before that date will remain unmodified. If you set an erroneous date, just select an earlier good billing date, and KNemo will repair it.
Months per billing period:
Traffic Notifications

Update interval
Update interface information every
Set how often KNemo polls interfaces for information. A lower value will speed up reaction to changes, but it will also increase CPU load.
Autosave interval:
Save interface statistics every n seconds. If 0, KNemo will only save statistics when it closes.

Statistics directory:
KNemo will log interface statistics in this directory.
Traffic
Traffic activity threshold:
If you are on a network with a lot of low-level traffic, you can increase this value so the tray icon does not constantly report activity.
packets/ sec
Traffic Rate Visualization
If checked, the transmit and receive colors will change according to the traffic rate. As the traffic rate increases, the color will change from the default color, to the max rate color.
Change color according to max visual rate
If this is checked, the Netload bar graphs will use a constant scale based on the maximum rates below. If unchecked, the bar graphs will change scale according to recent traffic rates.
Always scale bar graphs to max visual rate
Max Visual Rate
The maximum incoming rate for this connection. This does not affect the actual traffic rate, only how KNemo displays it.
KiB/ sec
Color:
The maximum outgoing rate for this connection. This does not affect the actual traffic rate, only how KNemo displays it.
