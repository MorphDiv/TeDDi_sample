, then select &quot; Text &quot; from the
Category
list.
Any numbers subsequently entered into the formatted range are interpreted as text.
The display of these &quot; numbers &quot; is left-justified, just as with other text.
If you have already entered normal numbers in cells and have afterwards changed the format of the cells to &quot; Text &quot; , the numbers will remain normal numbers.
They will not be converted.
Only numbers entered afterwards, or numbers which are then edited, will become text numbers.
If you decide to enter a number directly as a text string, enter an apostrophe (') first.
For example, for years in column headings, you can enter '1999, '2000 and '2001.
The apostrophe is not visible in the cell, it only indicates that the entry is to be recognised as a text string and not as a number.
This is useful if, for example, you enter a telephone number or bank sort code that begins with a zero (0), because zeroes (0) at the start of a sequence of digits are removed in normal number formats.
