Tasktop
Cross-application task manager
(c) 2009, Mandriva, Mathieu Dupuy
Bugs have to be reported at http: / /qa. mandriva. com
Tasktop is a cross-application task manager. It lets you create tasks and associate resources to them, such as files, Web pages, emails, contacts etc. Tasktop builds upon Nepomuk, the KDE metadata layer.

The connection to the Nepomuk server could not be established. The application will not be able to run properly. Please check from the KDE System Settings that the Nepomuk server has been started.
