Saving Settings & Profiles
General Settings
When you close down & konqueror; your current View menu settings (such as the View Mode, Use index. html and Show Hidden Files items) are not automatically saved as the default options; however, you can have & konqueror; remember these settings by selecting Settings Save View Profile "Web Browsing"... and the current setting will become the default option to be used the next time & konqueror; is started.
But you can also specify different View menu settings for an individual folder. To do this check the View Properties Saved in Folder box in the Settings menu, change the View settings to whatever you want then uncheck the View Properties saved in Folder box. Doing this creates a. directory file in that folder to hold the folder View settings. Use the Settings Remove Folder Properties option to remove the folder specific settings (or just delete the. directory file).
One nice use of this feature is if you have a folder full of pictures. You can set that particular folder to display thumbnails of the pictures (by choosing Icon View and Preview Show Previews from the View menu) when you open it, while not displaying images as thumbnails in other folders.
View Profiles
& konqueror; can save a whole set of options as a View Profile. Some view profiles are part of the standard & konqueror; installation, such as Web Browsing and File Management, but you can add your own, too.
To modify a view profile (say, the Web Browsing profile), load the profile with Settings Load View Profile Web Browsing, and change the & konqueror; settings to whatever you want. Now select Settings Save View Profile "Web Browsing".... In the dialog which appears, you can change the name of the profile, which will create a new profile with that name, or you can leave the name as it is to modify the current profile. If you select Save URLs in profile, the current & URL; will be loaded when you load that view profile. This functions in a similar way to the Home Page in many web browsers. If you want & konqueror; to start up with an empty window enter about: blank into the location bar before saving the profile.
You can create a desktop icon to start & konqueror; with your new profile. First create a desktop icon by dragging the & konqueror; icon from the K menu onto the desktop and selecting Copy Here. Then right click on the new icon, select Properties... and change Program Name in the Execute tab page to kfmclient openProfile MyNewProfile, MyNewProfile being what you called the new profile. Then in the General tab page change the name to something like MyNewProfile and pick a more suitable icon.
