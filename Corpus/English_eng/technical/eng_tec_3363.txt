(PHP 3 = 3.0.9, PHP 4)
Size is expressed in pixels.
Foreground is the color in which the text will be painted.
Background is the color to which the text will try to fade in with antialiasing.
No pixels with the color background are actually painted, so the background image does not need to be of solid color.
The coordinates given by x, y will define the origin (or reference point) of the first character (roughly the lower-left corner of the character).
This is different from the imagestring(), where x, y define the upper-right corner of the first character.
Refer to PostScipt documentation about fonts and their measuring system if you have trouble understanding how this works.
Space allows you to change the default value of a space in a font.
This amount is added to the normal value and can also be negative.
Tightness allows you to control the amount of white space between characters.
This amount is added to the normal character width and can also be negative.
Angle is in degrees.
Antialias_steps allows you to control the number of colours used for antialiasing text.
Allowed values are 4 and 16.
The higher value is recommended for text sizes lower than 20, where the effect in text quality is quite visible.
With bigger sizes, use 4.
It 's less computationally intensive.
Parameters space and tightness are expressed in character space units, where 1 unit is 1 / 1000th of an em-square.
Parameters space, tightness, angle and antialias are optional.
This function returns an array containing the following elements:
0
lower left x-coordinate
1
lower left y-coordinate
2
upper right x-coordinate
3
upper right y-coordinate
