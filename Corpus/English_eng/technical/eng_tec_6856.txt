Read Error Rate
Frequency of errors while reading raw data from the disk. A non-zero value indicates a problem with either the disk surface or read/write heads
Throughput Performance
Average efficiency of the disk
Spinup Time
Time needed to spin up the disk
Start/Stop Count
Number of spindle start/stop cycles
Reallocated Sector Count
Count of remapped sectors. When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it marks the sector as "reallocated" and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area)
Read Channel Margin
Margin of a channel while reading data.
Seek Error Rate
Frequency of errors while positioning
Seek Timer Performance
Average efficiency of operations while positioning
Power-On Hours
Number of hours elapsed in the power-on state
Spinup Retry Count
Number of retry attempts to spin up
Calibration Retry Count
Number of attempts to calibrate the device
Power Cycle Count
Number of power-on events
Soft read error rate
Frequency of errors while reading from the disk
Reported Uncorrectable Errors
Number of errors that could not be recovered using hardware ECC
High Fly Writes
Number of times a recording head is flying outside its normal operating range
Airflow Temperature
Airflow temperature of the drive
G-sense Error Rate
Frequency of mistakes as a result of impact loads
Power-off Retract Count
Number of power-off or emergency retract cycles
Load/Unload Cycle Count
Number of cycles into landing zone position
Current internal temperature of the drive
Hardware ECC Recovered
Number of ECC on-the-fly errors
Reallocation Count
Number of remapping operations. The raw value of this attribute shows the total number of (successful and unsuccessful) attempts to transfer data from reallocated sectors to a spare area
Current Pending Sector Count
Number of sectors waiting to be remapped. If the sector waiting to be remapped is subsequently written or read successfully, this value is decreased and the sector is not remapped. Read errors on the sector will not remap the sector, it will only be remapped on a failed write attempt
Uncorrectable Sector Count
The total number of uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector. A rise in the value of this attribute indicates defects of the disk surface and/or problems in the mechanical subsystem
UDMA CRC Error Rate
Number of CRC errors during UDMA mode
Write Error Rate
Number of errors while writing to disk (or) multi-zone error rate (or) flying-height
Soft Read Error Rate
Number of off-track errors
Data Address Mark Errors
Number of Data Address Mark (DAM) errors (or) vendor-specific
Run Out Cancel
Number of ECC errors
Soft ECC correction
Number of errors corrected by software ECC
Thermal Asperity Rate
Number of Thermal Asperity Rate errors
Flying Height
Height of heads above the disk surface
Spin High Current
Amount of high current used to spin up the drive
Spin Buzz
Number of buzz routines to spin up the drive
Offline Seek Performance
Drive's seek performance during offline operations
Disk Shift
Shift of disk is possible as a result of strong shock loading in the store, as a result of falling (or) temperature
Number of errors as a result of impact loads as detected by a shock sensor
Loaded Hours
Number of hours in general operational state
Load/Unload Retry Count
Loading on drive caused by numerous recurrences of operations, like reading, recording, positioning of heads, etc
Load Friction
Load on drive caused by friction in mechanical parts of the store
Total number of load cycles
Load-in Time
General time for loading in a drive
Torque Amplification Count
Quantity efforts of the rotating moment of a drive
Number of power-off retract events
GMR Head Amplitude
Amplitude of heads trembling (GMR-head) in running mode
Temperature of the drive
Endurance Remaining
Number of physical erase cycles completed on the drive as a percentage of the maximum physical erase cycles the drive supports
Uncorrectable ECC Count
Number of uncorrectable ECC errors
Good Block Rate
Number of available reserved blocks as a percentage of the total number of reserved blocks
Head Flying Hours
Time while head is positioning
Read Error Retry Rate
Number of errors while reading from a disk
