Description
reportview is not intended to be used directly.
reportview is a small program that asks KWeatherService to display a weather report. Information shown includes the temperature, wind speed and air pressure.
KWeatherService is a DCOP service used by both reportview and the & kweather; panel applet to provide weather data. There is no need to start KWeatherService separately; reportview will start the service itself if needed.
