Select printer from database
The foomatic printer database contains various manufacturer provided PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files and also can generate PPD files for a large number of (non PostScript) printers. But in general manufacturer provided PPD files provide better access to the specific features of the printer.
Provide PPD file
PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files can often be found on the driver disk that comes with the printer. For PostScript printers they are often part of the Windows ® driver.

Try to transfer the current settings
Use the new PPD (Postscript Printer Description) as is.
This way all current option settings will be lost. The default settings of the new PPD will be used.
Try to copy the option settings over from the old PPD.
This is done by assuming that options with the same name do have the same meaning. Settings of options that are not present in the new PPD will be lost and options only present in the new PPD will be set to default.
