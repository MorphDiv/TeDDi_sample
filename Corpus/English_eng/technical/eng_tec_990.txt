Letter Wizard
Starts the wizard for a letter template.
You can use this template for both business and personal correspondence.
$[officename] comes with sample templates for personal or business letters, which you can customise to your own needs with the help of the wizard.
The wizard leads you step-by-step in creating a document template and offers numerous layout and design options.
The preview gives you an impression of how the finished letter will appear according to the settings you choose.
Within the wizard, you can modify your entries and options at any time.
You may also skip an entire page or even all the wizard pages, in which case the current (or default) settings will remain in effect.
Personal
letter option, some pages which contain elements specific to business letters will not be included in the wizard dialogue box.
Back
Allows you to view the selections that you made on the previous steps.
The current settings will be saved.
Next
Saves the current settings and continues to the next page.
Finish
According to your selections, the wizard creates a new document template and saves it on your hard disc.
$[officename] creates a new document based on the existing templates with the &quot; Untitled X &quot; name (X stands for the consecutive numbering) and displays it on the work area.
$[officename] saves the current settings in the wizard according to the chosen template.
These settings are used as the default settings the next time you activate the wizard.
