Note of the Day
This add-in automatically creates a "Today" note for jotting daily thoughts down. As an example, a "Today" note created on February 28, 2013 would be called "Today: Thursday, February 28 2013".
If you leave a "Today" note unmodified, the add-in will automatically delete the note.
To customize the content of the default "Today" note, create a new note and change the title of the note to "Today: Template". Change the content of the template note to whatever you like. New "Today" notes will then use the content of your "Today: Template" note.

Using template notes
Template Notes
Template Note Usage
Template notes are used to define the content for newly created notes. Templates are just like regular notes with some additional features.
You can define a single main template note and one for each notebook you have. These templates define the content of every new note you create:
Every new note you create in
Every new note created in a notebook will have the content of that notebook's template note, if any. If no template note for a notebook is defined, the default note content will be used.
To create or modify a template note:
Main template note
Open
Notebook template note
Right click on a notebook in the main window and select
Template Note Features
A template note is like an ordinary note except that it is not shown in note lists and has a template bar at the top.
Template note
Template note window
The template bar has the following features:
Convert to regular note
Press this button to turn the template into a regular note, visible in the list of notes. This action is similar to deleting a template note.
Save Size
If you check this box, the size of a newly created note will be identical to that of the template note. When this checkbox is not checked, new notes' windows will have the default size.
Save Selection
If this box is checked, new notes will have not only the content of the template note, but also its selection. Use this option if you want a certain part of the content in the new note to be initially selected.
Save Title
This checkbox lets you base the title of new notes on a template note's title. With this box checked, a new note will have the template note's title with a unique number appended. Otherwise the default title will be used.

After creating a new note, a new window will appear with the title "New Note N". At the top of the note is a toolbar with several buttons and text. Directly below this toolbar is the content area of the note.

The note can be edited by clicking in the content area and using the keyboard to add and remove content. The first line is considered the title of the note. By default this is populated with the text "New Note N". The title is changed by clicking in the content area on the first line and using the keyboard to change the title. By default, focus is given to the content area upon creation of a new note, so you can immediately start editing the note without the need to click on the content area with the mouse.
