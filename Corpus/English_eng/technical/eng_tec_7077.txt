In Memory of Raphael Higino
The release of GNOME 2.22 is dedicated to Raphael Higino, member of the GNOME translation team and GNOME Brazil.
Raphael Higino
Raphael Higino was a long-time contributor to GNOME's Brazillian translation effort and was very passionate about GNOME. He was a very dependable member of the team and was always willing to lend a guiding hand to new contributors. He had made a number of very good friends in the community. Raphael passed away last year in a motorcycle accident at only 24 years of age. His dedication, hard work, and companionship will always be cherished by the community and all those whose lives he touched.

What's New in Accessibility
Screenreading and Magnification Improvements


The screen magnifier has been improved and can now take advantage of technology like X compositing to allow smoother scrolling and fullscreen scrolling on hardware that supports it. There is also improved support for colorblind filters.
New Mouse Accessibility
GNOME 2.22 now includes a set of special accessibility enhancements for controlling the mouse. Features include:
the ability to capture the pointer within a region of the screen;
the ability to open the contextual menu with only one mouse button; and
the ability to perform different types of clicks (e.g. single click, double click, context click, and dragging) without using a mouse button (usually referred to as a

Looking Forward to GNOME 2.24
Development doesn't stop with GNOME 2.22. Work has already begun on GNOME 2.24, due to be released exactly six months after 2.22.
a new version of GNOME's Ekiga VoIP client featuring a revamped user interface and SIP presence support;
the Empathy instant messaging client utilising the Telepathy communications framework;
the often requested column and list views in GNOME's
the completion of the port from GNOME-VFS to GVFS; and
bug fixes, performance improvements, and memory improvements throughout the desktop.
Some of the exciting things to look forward to in GNOME 2.24 will hopefully include:

Installing GNOME
You can try out GNOME 2.22 with the LiveCD, which contains all of the software included in GNOME 2.22 on a single CD. You can boot your computer directly from the LiveCD without installing anything. The LiveCD can be downloaded from the GNOME
To install or upgrade your machine to GNOME 2.22, we recommend you install official packages from your vendor or distribution. Popular distributions will make GNOME 2.22 available very soon, and some already have development versions with GNOME 2.22 available. You can get a list of distributions that ship GNOME and discover the latest versions they ship on our
If you are brave and patient and would like to build GNOME from source, we recommend you use one of the build tools.
While it is possible to build GNOME directly from the release tarballs, we strongly recommend the use of one of the build tools above.

What's New For Developers
The GNOME 2.22 Developer Platform provides a stable base for independent software developers to create third-party applications. GNOME and its platform are licensed to allow the creation of both free and proprietary software to run on top of GNOME.
Libraries in the GNOME Platform are guaranteed to be API and ABI stable for the rest of the GNOME 2.x release series. Libraries in the GNOME Desktop do not have this guarantee, but most remain consistent from release to release.
GVFS and GIO
GVFS is a userspace virtual file system with backends for protocols like SFTP, FTP, DAV, SMB, ObexFTP. GVFS is the replacement for GNOME-VFS. GNOME-VFS should now be considered deprecated, and developers should not use it in new applications.
GVFS consists of two parts:
GIO, a new shared library that is part of GLib and provides the API for GVFS; and
GVFS itself, a new package containing backends for various file system types and protocols such as SFTP, FTP, DAV, SMB and ObexFTP.
GVFS/GIO aims to provide a modern, easy-to-use VFS system. Its goal is to provide an API that developers prefer over raw POSIX IO calls. Rather than cloning the POSIX IO API, it provides a higher-level, document-centric interface. As well as reading and writing files, GIO provides facilities for file monitoring, asynchronous IO, and filename completion.
GVFS works by running a single master daemon (gvfsd) that keeps track of the current GVFS mounts. Each mount is run in a separate daemon. (Some mounts share a daemon process, but most don't.) Clients talk to the mounts with a combination of D-Bus calls (on the session bus and using peer-to-peer D-Bus) and a custom protocol for file contents. Moving the backends out of process minimises dependency bloat for applications and makes the whole system more robust.
GVFS also offers a FUSE mountpoint in
Unlike GNOME-VFS, connections in GVFS are stateful. This means that a user only needs to enter his or her password once, not over and over again for each successive connection.
With the switch to GVFS, automounting and autostart are now handled directly by

Regressions
Although GVFS fixes a lot of problems that previously existed by using GNOME-VFS, there are currently some feature regressions. Most notable is the lack of fonts:// and themes:// targets.
These issues will be fixed as soon as possible. There are also some applications that still remain to be ported over to GVFS. The state of this port is

What's New For Administrators
PolicyKit Integration
PolicyKit is a new cross-desktop security framework. The purpose of PolicyKit is to provide a consistent way for user applications to gain extra privileges, e.g. for administrative applications.
Using PolicyKit, administrators can now configure system-wide settings. For example, you might allow some user to adjust the date and time of the clock, or you might grant specific users the ability to start and stop system services.
For users, control panels now feature unlock buttons next to settings they are not currently authorized to change. Clicking on the unlock button will ask the user to provide extra authorization credentials.

Better System Tools
GNOME's system administration tools now monitor for changes in the configuration files they're editing. This means that if another administrator changes the configuration, your display is updated to reflect those changes.

What's New For Users
The GNOME Project's focus on users and usability continues in GNOME 2.22 with its hundreds of bug fixes and user-requested improvements. The sheer number of enhancements makes it impossible to list every change and improvement made, but we hope to highlight some of the more exciting user-oriented features in this release of GNOME.

Introduction
GNOME 2.22 is the latest version of the GNOME Desktop: a popular, multi-platform desktop environment for your computer. GNOME's focus is ease of use, stability, and first class internationalization and accessibility support. GNOME is Free and Open Source Software and provides all of the common tools computer users expect of a modern computing environment, such as email, groupware, web browsing, file management, multimedia, and games. Furthermore, GNOME provides a flexible and powerful platform for software developers, both on the desktop and in mobile applications.
The GNOME Desktop is released every six months and contains many new features, improvements, bug fixes, and translations. GNOME 2.22 continues this tradition. To learn more about GNOME and the qualities that distinguish it from other computer desktop environments (such as usability, accessibility, internationalization, and freedom) visit the
