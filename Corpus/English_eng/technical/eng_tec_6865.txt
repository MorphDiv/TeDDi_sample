About
Even though it's extremely user-friendly, GNOME is a large and complex system, and thus, requires some learning to use to the fullest. To make that easier, we've provided some very useful documentation.
Developers
For those who develop, or are interested in developing GNOME and applications for GNOME. You will find developer documentation and information on how to get involved, and much more.
Administrators
Across the world, there are many large to small deployments of GNOME, with their specific needs, and system administrators to manage them. Here you will find information on tools and methods to work with many GNOME desktops.

Unique is a library for writing single-instance applications. If you launch a single-instance application twice, the second instance will either just quit or will send a message to the running instance. Unique makes it easy to write this kind of application by providing a base class, taking care of all the IPC machinery needed to send messages to a running instance, and also handling startup notification.
The GNOME Devtools Library package provides a docking system and several utilities useful to GNOME development tools and GNOME applications in general.
