EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ZACTRAN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Zactran?
Zactran is a solution for injection for cattle that contains the active substance gamithromycin (150 mg/ ml).
What is Zactran used for?
Zactran is an anibiotic.
It is used in cattle to treat or to prevent Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) caused by the bacteria Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni.
When using Zactran to prevent BRD the presence of the disease in the herd should be established first.
Zactran is given as a single subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.
The dose to use is calculated based on the weight of the animal being treated.
Animals weighing more than 250 kg will need to be injected at more than one site.
How does Zactran work?
The active substance of Zactran, gamithromycin, is an antibiotic of the macrolide group.
It works by blocking the bacteria’ s ribosomes, which are the parts of the cells where proteins are produced, and consequently inhibiting the growth of bacteria.
How has Zactran been studied?
Appropriate studies have been made to show the effectiveness of Zactran in cattle.
The main clinical studies were carried out on farms in a number of countries in Europe, as well as outside the EU.
For the treatment of BRD, the effect of Zactran was studied in comparison to another macrolide antibiotic (tulathromycin) already authorised in the EU, in cattle already affected by the disease.
For the prevention of BRD the effect of Zactran was studied in comparison to placebo (dummy treatment) in cattle which had been in contact with diseased animals on the same farm and, therefore, likely to also develop the disease.

What benefit has Zactran shown during the studies?
Zactran has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment and prevention of BRD, associated with Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni.
In the treatment of BRD Zactran has been shown to be as effective as tulathromycin.
What is the risk associated with Zactran?
After injection of Zactran, up to 45% of animals will show some swelling at the site of injection.
The animals may also show some signs of slight pain for one day.
The swelling generally resolves in 3 to 14 days but may persist in some animals for up to 35 days after treatment.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
People with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to similar antibiotics (macrolide class) should avoid contact with Zactran.
Zactran may cause irritation to the eyes or the skin.
Therefore, contact with skin or eyes should be avoided.
If Zactran comes in direct contact with the eyes, they should be flushed immediately with clean water.
Similarly, if Zactran comes into direct contact with skin the affected area should be washed immediately with clean water.
In case of accidental self-injection, medical advice should be sought immediately and the package leaflet or the label should be presented to the physician.
What is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption (withdrawal period)?
After the last administration of Zactran, cattle should not be slaughtered for 64 days.
What is the time to allow before milk can be taken from the animal for human consumption?
As the safety of Zactran in breeding animals has not been studied, the medicine should not be used in lactating cows or heifers producing milk for human consumption.
It should also not be used in pregnant cows or heifers which are intended to produce milk for human consumption within 2 months of calving.
Why has Zactran been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) concluded that the benefits of Zactran exceeded the risks for the therapeutic and preventive treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) associated with Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Histophilus somni, (the presence of the disease in the herd should be established before preventive treatment) and recommended that Zactran should be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about Zactran:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Zactran to Merial on 24/ 07/ 2008.
