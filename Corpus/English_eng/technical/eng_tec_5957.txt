MS Write Import Dialog
& Encoding
Select the encoding of the Write document. Try the Default Encoding (CP 1252), if unsure.
& Other encoding:
& Default encoding (CP 1252)
Most Write documents are stored using this encoding (also known as windows-1252). Select this if unsure.
& Advanced
These advanced options allow you to fine-tune the importing of formatting information. They compensate for differences between KWord and MS Write by adding extra formatting information (not found in the original document), to try to make the imported document look as close to the original as possible. It is safe to use the defaults, if unsure.
Compensate for & linespacing differences
Try to simulate Write's linespacing by adding some spaces before each paragraph.
Enable & image positioning
Use paragraph indentation to position images.
