ANNEX 1
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Aerinaze 2.5mg/ 120 mg modified-release tablets
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each tablet contains 2.5 mg desloratadine and 120 mg pseudoephedrine (as sulphate).
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Modified-release tablet.
Blue and white bilayer oval tablet with “ D12” branded to blue layer.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis when accompanied by nasal congestion.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and over:
The recommended dose of Aerinaze is one tablet twice a day.
The tablet may be taken with a full glass of water but must be swallowed entirely (without crushing, breaking or chewing it).
The tablet may be taken with or without food.
Aerinaze should not be used in children below the age of 12 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).
The duration of treatment should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have disappeared.
It is advisable to limit treatment to about 10 days, as during chronic administration the activity of pseudoephedrine may diminish.
After improvement of the congestive condition of the mucosae of the upper airway, treatment may be maintained with desloratadine alone, if necessary.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to adrenergic agents or to loratadine.
As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, it is also contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or during the 2 weeks following the stopping of such treatment.
Aerinaze is also contraindicated in patients with: • narrow-angle glaucoma, • urinary retention, • cardiovascular diseases such as ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmia and severe hypertension, • hyperthyroidism,
2 • a history of haemorrhagic stroke or with risk factors which could increase the risk of haemorrhagic stroke.
This is due to the alpha-mimetic activity of pseudoephedrine in combination with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitine, pergolide, lisuride, cabergoline, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or any other decongestant medicinal product used as a nasal decongestant, either by oral route or by nasal route (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazoline…).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Do not exceed the recommended dosage and the duration of treatment (see section 4.2).
Patients of 60 years or older are more likely to experience adverse reactions to sympathomimetic medicinal products, such as pseudoephedrine.
The safety and efficacy of the combination have not been established in this population, and there are insufficient data to give adequate dose recommendations.
Therefore the combination product should be used with caution in patients above 60 years of age.
Renal or hepatic impairment:
The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze has not been established in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, and there are insufficient data to give adequate dose recommendations.
The combination product is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.
Aerinaze should not be used in children below the age of 12 years (see section 4.2).
Patients should be informed that the treatment should be discontinued in case of hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological sign (such as headache or increased headache).
Central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension may be produced by sympathomimetic amines.
These effects may be more likely to occur in children, elderly patients, or in cases of overdose (see section 4.9).
Caution should be exercised in the following patient groups: • Patients receiving digitalis • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction, or positive anamnesis of bronchospasm.
Use with caution in patients with stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, and obstruction of the vesical cervix.
Caution should also be exercised in patients being treated with other sympathomimetics.
These include: • decongestants • anorexogenics or amphetamine-type psychostimulants • antihypertensive agents • tricyclic antidepressants and other antihistamines.
Caution should be exercised in patients suffering from migraine who are currently being treated with ergot alkaloid vasoconstrictors.
Pseudoephedrine sulphate carries the risk of abuse.
Increased doses may ultimately produce toxicity.
Continuous use can lead to tolerance resulting in an increased risk of overdosing.
Depression may follow rapid withdrawal.
3 Perioperative acute hypertension can occur if volatile halogenated anaesthetics are used during treatment with indirect sympathomimetic agents.
Therefore, if surgery is scheduled, it is preferable to discontinue treatment 24 hours before anaesthesia.
Athletes should be informed that treatment with pseudoephedrine could lead to positive doping tests.
The administration of Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours before skin tests since antihistamines maybe prevent or reduce other wise positive reaction to dermal reactivity index.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered.
Reversible and irreversible MAO inhibitor(s) may cause: risk of vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure.
Concurrent administration with sympathomimetic medicines may result in critical hypertension reactions.
The following combinations are not recommended: • bromocriptine • cabergoline • lisuride, pergolide: risk of vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure.
Dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergometrine: risk of vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure.
Other vasoconstrictors used as nasal decongestant, by oral or nasal route (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazoline…): risk of vasoconstriction.
Sympathomimetic medicines reduce the antihypertensive effect of α -methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, veratrum alkaloids, and guanethidine.
Antacids increase the rate of pseudoephedrine sulphate absorption, kaolin decreases it.
The interaction with Aerinaze and alcohol has not been studied.
However, in a clinical pharmacology trial desloratadine taken concomitantly with alcohol did not potentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol.
No significant differences were found in the psychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or with alcohol.
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, some interactions with other medicinal products can not be fully excluded.
Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Neither desloratadine nor the combination of loratadine and pseudoephedrine were teratogenic in animal studies.
The safe use of Aerinaze during pregnancy has not been established; however experience from a large number of exposed pregnancies in humans does not reveal any increase in the frequency of malformations as compared to the incidence in the general population.
4 Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine are both excreted in breast milk.
Decreased milk production in nursing mothers has been reported with pseudoephedrine.
Therefore Aerinaze should not be used in breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed with Aerinaze.
In clinical trials that assessed the driving ability, no impairment occurred in patients receiving desloratadine.
However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines.
It is not expected that pseudoephedrine sulphate impairs psychomotor performance.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In clinical trials involving 414 adults the most frequent of adverse events reported were insomnia (8.9%), dry mouth (7.2%) and headache (3.1%).
These and other undesirable effects reported during the clinical trials are listed in the following table.

4.9 Overdose
Symptoms:
Symptoms of overdose are mostly of a sympathomimetic nature.
Symptoms may vary from CNS depression (sedation, apnoea, diminished mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) to CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucination, tremors, convulsions) with possible fatal outcome.
Other symptoms may include: headache, anxiety, micturition difficulty, muscle weakness and tenseness, euphoria, excitement, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotension.
CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as are atropine-like symptoms (dry mouth, fixed and dilated pupils, flushing, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).
Some patients may present a toxic psychosis with delusions and hallucinations.
Treatment:
In the event of overdose, start symptomatic and supportive treatment immediately and maintain it for as long as necessary.
Adsorption of active substance remaining in the stomach may be attempted by administration of active charcoal suspended in water.
Perform gastric lavage with physiologic saline solution, particularly in children.
In adults, tap water can be used.
Remove as much as possible of the amount administered before the next instillation.
Desloratadine is not removed by haemodialysis and it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal dialysis.
After emergency treatment, continue to monitor the patient medically.
Treatment of the pseudoephedrine overdose is symptomatic and supportive.
Stimulants (analeptics) must not be used.
Hypertension can be controlled with an adrenoceptor-blocking agent and tachycardia with a
6 beta-blocking agent.
Short acting barbituates, diazepam or paraldehyde may be administered to control seizures.
Hyperpyrexia, especially in children, may require treatment with tepid water sponge baths or hypothermia blanket.
Apnoea is treated with respiratory assistance.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antihistamines – H1 antagonist, ATC code:
R06A X27.
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Nasal decongestants for systemic use group, ATC code:
R01BA52.
The pharmacodynamics of Aerinaze tablets are directly related to that of its components.
Desloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity.
After oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine H1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system.
Desloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies.
These include inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast cells/ basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.
Desloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system.
In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard measures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying.
In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to placebo.
Desloratadine given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg did not affect psychomotor performance in clinical trials.
Pseudoephedrine sulphate (d-isoephedrine sulphate) is a sympathomimetic agent with mostly α -mimetic activity in comparison with the β -activity.
Pseudoephedrine sulphate provides a nasal decongestant effect after oral administration due to its vasoconstrictive action.
It has an indirect sympathomimetic effect due primarily to the release of adrenergic mediators from the post-ganglionic nerve endings.
Oral administration of pseudoephedrine at the recommended dose can cause other sympathomimetic effects, such as increased blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of central nervous system excitation.
The clinical efficacy and safety of Aerinaze tablets was evaluated in two, 2-week multicentre, randomized parallel group clinical trials involving 1,248 patients 12 to 78 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis, 414 of whom received Aerinaze tablets.
In both trials, the antihistaminic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets as measured by total symptom score, excluding nasal congestion, was significantly greater than pseudoephedrine alone over the 2-week treatment period.
In addition, the decongestant efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, as measured by nasal stuffiness/ congestion, was significantly greater than desloratadine alone over the 2-week treatment period.
There were no significant differences in the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Desloratadine and Pseudoephedrine:
7 In a single dose pharmacokinetic study with Aerinaze, plasma concentration of desloratadine can be detected within 30 minutes of administration.
The mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (Tmax) for desloratadine occurred at approximately 4-5 hours post dose and mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of approximately 1.09 ng/ ml and 31.6 ng• hr/ ml, respectively, were observed.
For pseudoephedrine, the mean Tmax occurred at 6-7 hours post dose and mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC) of approximately 263 ng/ ml and 4,588 ng• hr/ ml, respectively, were observed.
Food had no effect on the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of desloratadine or pseudoephedrine.
The half-life for desloratadine is 27.4 hours.
The apparent half-life of pseudoephedrine is 7.9 hours.
Following oral administration of Aerinaze for 14 days in normal healthy volunteers, steady-state conditions were reached on day 10 for desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine.
For desloratadine, mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC (0-12 h)) of approximately 1.7 ng/ ml and 16 ng• hr/ ml were observed, respectively.
For pseudoephedrine, mean steady state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC (0-12 h)) of 459 ng/ ml and 4,658 ng• hr/ ml were observed.
Desloratadine:
In a series of pharmacokinetic and clinical trials, 6% of the subjects reached a higher concentration of desloratadine.
The prevalence of this poor metabolizer phenotype was greater among Blacks adults than Caucasians adults (18% vs.
2%) however the safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general population.
In a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study conducted with the tablet formulation in healthy adult subjects, four subjects were found to be poor metabolisers of desloratadine.
These subjects had a Cmax concentration about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of approximately 89 hours.
Desloratadine is moderately bound (83% - 87%) to plasma proteins.
Pseudoephedrine sulphate:
Its elimination half-life in humans, at an approximate urinary pH of 6, ranges from 5 to 8 hours.
The active substance and its metabolite are excreted in urine; 55-75% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged.
The rate of excretion is accelerated and the duration of action decreased in acidic urine (pH5).
In case of alkalinization of the urine, a partial resorption takes place.
A component interaction study demonstrated that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine following administration of pseudoephedrine alone was bioequivalent to pseudoephedrine exposure following administration of the Aerinaze tablet.
Therefore absorption of pseudoephedrine was not affected by the Aerinaze formulation.
Pseudoephedrine is presumed to cross the placenta and the haematoencephalic barrier.
The active substance is excreted in breast milk of lactating women.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
No pre-clinical studies have been performed with Aerinaze.
However, non-clinical data with desloratadine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction.
The lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with desloratadine and loratadine.
8 The combination of loratadine/ pseudoephedrine sulphate used in acute and multiple-dose studies, exhibited a low order of toxicity.
The combination was not more toxic than their individual components, and observed effects were generally related to the pseudoephedrine component.
During reproductive toxicity studies, the combination of loratadine/ pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic when administered orally to rats at doses up to 150 mg/ kg/ day and rabbits at doses up to 120 mg/ kg/ day.

Further information
1.
WHAT AERINAZE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Aerinaze tablets contain a combination of two medicines, an antihistamine and a decongestant.
Antihistamines help to reduce allergic symptoms by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body.
Decongestants help to clear nasal congestion.
Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as, sneezing, runny or itchy nose, and eyes, when accompanied by nasal congestion.
2.
BEFORE YOU TAKE AERINAZE
Do not take Aerinaze
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to desloratadine, loratadine, pseudoephedrine or to any of the
other ingredients of Aerinaze.
- if you are also receiving heart or blood pressure medicine.
- if you have glaucoma, difficulty in urinating, urinary tract blockage, high blood pressure, heart or
blood vessel disease, a history of stroke, or an overactive thyroid.
- Tell your doctor if you are receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (a class of antidepressant
agents) therapy or have stopped taking these types of medicines within the last 14 days.
Take special care with Aerinaze Certain conditions may make you unusually sensitive to the decongestant pseudoephedrine contained in this medicine.
Before taking Aerinaze, tell your doctor or pharmacist:
- if you are 60 years of age or older.
Older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of this
medicine.
- if you have eye problems (such as increased pressure in the eye or glaucoma), diabetes mellitus
(sugar diabetes), stenosing peptic ulcer (ulcer leading to the narrowing of the stomach, small intestine or esophagus), pyloral or duodenal blockage (intestine blockage), vesical cervix blockage
19 (bladder neck blockage), previous history of bronchospasm (difficulty breathing due to tightening of the lung muscles), prostate enlargement or problems with your liver, kidney, or bladder.
- if you are scheduled to have surgery, because you may have to stop taking Aerinaze for a few days.
- if you are taking digitalis, a medicine used to treat certain heart disorders, because the dosage may
have to be adjusted.
- if you are taking α -methyldopa, mecamylamine, reserpine, veratrum alkaloids and guanethidine for
blood pressure, because the dose may need to be adjusted.
- if you are taking decongestants (oral or nasal), appetite suppressants (diet pills), or amphetamines,
because together with Aerinaze, these medicines may raise your blood pressure.
- if you are taking ergot alkaloids (such as dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, or methylergometrine) for
migraines.
Together with Aerinaze, these medicines may raise your blood pressure.
- if you are taking linezolide (an antibiotic), bromocriptine (for infertility or Parkinson’ s disease),
cabergoline, lisuride and pergolide (for Parkinson’ s disease).
Together with Aerinaze, these medicines may raise your blood pressure.
- if you are taking antacids, because they may increase the effectiveness of Aerinaze.
- if you are taking kaolin (for diarrhoea), because it may lower the effectiveness of Aerinaze.
Tell your doctor if you experience or are diagnosed with any of the following: • high blood pressure • a fast or pounding heart beat • abnormal heart rhythm • feeling sick and headache or increase headache while using Aerinaze.
Your doctor may advise you to stop your treatment.
One of the medicines in Aerinaze, pseudoephedrine sulphate, has the potential to be abused and large doses of pseudoephedrine sulphate can be toxic.
Laboratory Tests Stop taking Aerinaze at least 48 hours before you have any skin tests.
Athletes taking Aerinaze may have positive doping-tests.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Taking Aerinaze with food and drink Aerinaze tablets may be taken with or without food.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine during pregnancy or breast-feeding.
