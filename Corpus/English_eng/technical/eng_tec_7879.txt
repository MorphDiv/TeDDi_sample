Full scan
Scan the complete scanning area including calibration strip. Be careful. Don't select the full height. For testing only.
Coarse calibration
Setup gain and offset for scanning automatically. If this option is disabled, options for setting the analog frontend parameters manually are provided. This option is enabled by default. For testing only.
Coarse calibration for first scan only
Coarse calibration is only done for the first scan. Works with most scanners and can save scanning time. If the image brightness is different with each scan, disable this option. For testing only.
Backtrack lines
Number of lines the scan slider moves back when backtracking occurs. That happens when the scanner scans faster than the computer can receive the data. Low values cause faster scans but increase the risk of omitting lines.

Number of scan lines to request in a SCSI read. Changing this parameter allows you to tune the speed at which data is read from the scanner during scans. If this is set too low, the scanner will have to stop periodically in the middle of a scan; if it's set too high, X-based frontends may stop responding to X events and your system could bog down.

Select the kind of test picture. Available options:
Solid black: fills the whole scan with black.
Solid white: fills the whole scan with white.
Color pattern: draws various color test patterns depending on the mode.
Grid: draws a black/white grid with a width and height of 10 mm per square.
Invert endianness
Exchange upper and lower byte of image data in 16 bit modes. This option can be used to test the 16 bit modes of frontends, e.g. if the frontend uses the correct endianness.
Read limit
Limit the amount of data transferred with each call to sane_read().
Size of read-limit
The (maximum) amount of data transferred with each call to sane_read().
Read delay
Delay the transfer of data to the pipe.
Duration of read-delay
How long to wait after transferring each buffer of data through the pipe.
Return-value of sane_read
Select the return-value of sane_read(). "Default" is the normal handling for scanning. All other status codes are for testing how the frontend handles them.
Loss of pixels per line
The number of pixels that are wasted at the end of each line.
Fuzzy parameters
Return fuzzy lines and bytes per line when sane_parameters() is called before sane_start().
Use non-blocking IO
Use non-blocking IO for sane_read() if supported by the frontend.
Offer select file descriptor
Offer a select filedescriptor for detecting if sane_read() will return data.
Enable test options

Bool test options
(1/6) Bool soft select soft detect

(2/6) Bool hard select soft detect
(2/6) Bool test option that has hard select and soft detect (and advanced) capabilities. That means the option can't be set by the frontend but by the user (e.g. by pressing a button at the device).
(3/6) Bool hard select
(3/6) Bool test option that has hard select (and advanced) capabilities. That means the option can't be set by the frontend but by the user (e.g. by pressing a button at the device) and can't be read by the frontend.
(4/6) Bool soft detect
(4/6) Bool test option that has soft detect (and advanced) capabilities. That means the option is read-only.
(5/6) Bool soft select soft detect emulated
(5/6) Bool test option that has soft select, soft detect, and emulated (and advanced) capabilities.
(6/6) Bool soft select soft detect auto
(6/6) Bool test option that has soft select, soft detect, and automatic (and advanced) capabilities. This option can be automatically set by the backend.
Int test options
