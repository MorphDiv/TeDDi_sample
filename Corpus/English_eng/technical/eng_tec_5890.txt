Tools Spelling...
This initiates the spellchecking program - a program designed to help the user catch and correct any spelling errors. Clicking on this entry will start the checker and bring up the speller dialog box through which the user can control the process. There are four settings lined up vertically in the center of the dialog with their corresponding labels just to the left. Starting at the top they are:
Unknown word:
Here, the spellchecker indicates the word currently under consideration. This happens when the checker encounters a word not in its dictionary - a file containing a list of correctly spelled words against which it compares each word in the editor.
Replace with:
If the checker has any similar words in its dictionary the first one will be listed here. The user can accept the suggestion, type in his or her own correction, or choose a different suggestion from the next box.
Language:
If you have installed multiple dictionaries, here you can select which dictionary/ language should be used.
On the right side of the dialog box are 6 buttons that allow the user to control the spellcheck process. They are:
Add to Dictionary
Pressing this button adds the Unknown word to the checker's dictionary. This means that in the future the checker will always consider this word to be correctly spelled.
Suggest
The checker may list here a number of possible replacements for the word under consideration. Clicking on any one of the suggestions will cause that word to be entered in the Replace with box, above.
Replace
This button has the checker replace the word under consideration in the document with the word in the Replace with box.
Replace All
This button causes the checker to replace not only the current Unknown word: but to automatically make the same substitution for any other occurrences of this Unknown word in the document.
Ignore
Activating this button will have the checker move on without making any changes.
Ignore All
This button tells the checker to do nothing with the current Unknown word: and to pass over any other instances of the same word.
This only applies to the current spellcheck run. If the checker is run again later it will stop on this same word.
Three more buttons are located horizontally along the bottom of the spellcheck dialog. They are:
Help
This invokes the & kde; help system starting at the & kate; help pages (this document).
Finished
This button ends the spellcheck process, and returns to the document.
Cancel
This button cancels the spellcheck process, all modifications are reverted, and you will return to your document.

This initiates the spellchecking program but it starts where your cursor is instead of at the beginning of the document.
Tools Spellcheck Selection...
Spellchecks the current selection.
Ctrl; I Tools Indent
This increases the paragraph's indentation by one step. The size of the step depends on the indentation settings.
Ctrl; Shift; I Tools Unindent
This reduces the paragraph's indentation by one step. The size of the step depends on the indentation settings.

Tools Align
