Inserting Data From Spreadsheets
Use the clipboard to copy the contents of a single cell.
You can also copy a formula from a cell into the clipboard (for example, from the input line of the formula bar) so that the formula can be inserted into a text.
To copy a cell range into a text document, select the cell range in the sheet and then use either the clipboard or drag-and-drop to insert the cells into the text document.
You will then find an OLE object in the text document, which you can edit further.
If you drag cells to the normal view of a presentation document, the cells will be inserted there as an OLE object.
If you drag cells into the outline view, each cell will form a line of the outline view.
If you just drag the cells you will move the cells.
The cells will only be copied if you press the Shift key when dragging.
When you copy a cell range from $[officename] Calc to the clipboard, the drawing objects, OLE objects and charts within this range are also copied.
They are also copied when you start a drag-and-drop action.
However, the objects will be inserted only if you drop them within the same document.
If you insert a cell range with an enclosed chart, the chart will keep its link to the source cell range only if you copied the chart and the source cell range together.
