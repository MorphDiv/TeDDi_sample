Returns record at position pos or empty string if no record exists at given position.
The yaz_record() function inspects a record in the current result set at the position specified.
If no database record exists at the given position an empty string is returned.
The type specifies the form of the returned record.
If type is "string" the record is returned in a string representation suitable for printing (for XML and SUTRS).
If type is "array" the record is returned as an array representation (for structured records).
If type is "raw" the record is returned in its original raw form.
Records in a result set are numbered 1, 2,... $hits where $hits is the count returned by yaz_hits().
