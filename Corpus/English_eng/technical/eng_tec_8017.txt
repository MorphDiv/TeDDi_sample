PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe.
Milky-white liquid.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.
Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with Official Guidance (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Focetria has been evaluated in adults aged 18-60 years and elderly over 60 years following a 0, 21 day schedule.
Adults and elderly:
0.5 ml.
A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks.
Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle.
No data are available in subjects below 18 years or in children.
Therefore health care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in that population.
For pregnant women, see section 4.6.
For further information, see section 5.1.
2 4.3 Contraindications
History of an anaphylactic (i. e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues of eggs, chicken proteins, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) of this vaccine.
However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need.
See section 4.4. for Special warnings and special precautions for use.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients and to eggs, chicken proteins, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.
If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection.
The vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or subcutaneously.
Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.
A protective response may not be induced in all vaccines (see section 5.1).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Focetria should not be given at the same time as other vaccines.
However, if co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs.
It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified.
The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment.
Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been observed.
The Western Blot technique disproves the results.
The transient false positive reactions could be due to the IgM response by the vaccine.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
No data have been generated with Focetria in pregnant women.
Therefore health care providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine to pregnant women taking into consideration official recommendations.
Data from vaccinations with seasonal interpandemic inactivated trivalent vaccines in pregnant women do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine.
The vaccine may be used during lactation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Focetria is unlikely to produce any effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
• Clinical trials
In clinical trials with different formulations (H5N3, H9N2 and H5N1) 542 subjects were exposed to thecandidate vaccine.
Of theses subjects, 464 subjects received the mock-up vaccine (A/ H5N1).
From the clinical trials with the pandemic vaccine, most of the reactions were mild in nature, of short duration and qualitatively similar to those induced by conventional seasonal influenza vaccines.
It is widely accepted that the adjuvant effect leading to increased immunogenicity is associated with a slightly higher frequency of local reactions (mostly mild pain) compared with conventional, nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines.
There were fewer reactions after the second vaccination compared with the first.
3 Adverse reactions from clinical trials with the mock-up vaccine are listed below (see section 5.1 for more information on mock-up vaccines).
The incidence of symptoms observed in subjects over 60 years of age was lower as compared to the 18-60 years old population.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:
Nervous system disorders Common (> 1/ 100, < 1/ 10): headache
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Common (> 1/ 100, < 1/ 10): sweating
Muscoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders Common (> 1/ 100, < 1/ 10): arthralgia and myalgia
General disorders and administration site conditions Common (> 1/ 100, < 1/ 10): injection site redness, injection site swelling, injection site induration, injection site ecchymosis and injection site pain, fever, malaise, fatigue and shivering
These reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment.
• Post-marketing surveillance
From Post-marketing surveillance with adjuvanted interpandemic trivalent vaccines with the similar composition of Focetria (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted with MF59C.1), the following adverse events have been reported:
Uncommon (> 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100):
Generalised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash.
Rare (> 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000):
Neuralgia, paraesthesia, convulsions, transient thrombocytopenia.
Allergic reactions, in rare cases leading to shock, have been reported.
Very rare (< 1/ 10,000):
Vasculitis with transient renal involvement and exudative erythema multiforme.
Neurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome.
Adverse event(s) from post-marketing surveillance with the pandemic vaccine: not applicable.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Influenza vaccine, ATC Code:
J07BB02
This section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccines following a two-dose administration.
Mock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating influenza viruses.
These antigens can be considered as ‘ novel’ antigens and simulate a situation where the 4 target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve.
Data obtained with a mock-up vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines.
A clinical trial was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant in 486 healthy adult volunteers.
Two doses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/ Vietnam/ 1194/ 2004) at 2 different dosages (7.5 and 15 µg hemagglutinin [HA]/ dose) with MF59C.1 adjuvant were administered three weeks apart.
The seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor** for anti-HA antibody in the adults measured by SRH were as follows:
anti-HA antibody
22 days after 1st dose
21 days after 2nd dose
Seroprotection rate Seroconversion rate Seroconversion factor * measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm ** geometric mean ratios of SRH
41% (95% CI:
33-49) 39% (95% CI:
31-47) 2.42 (2.02-2.89)
86% (95% CI:
79-91) 85% (95% CI:
79-91) 7.85 (6.7-9.2)
The seroprotection rate*, seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor ** for anti-HA antibody in subjects aged over 60 measured by SRH were as follows:
anti-HA antibody
22 days after 1st dose
21 days after 2nd dose
Seroprotection rate Seroconversion rate Seroconversion factor * measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm ** geometric mean ratios of SRH
53% (95% CI:
42-64) 45% (95% CI:
34-56) 2.85 (2.22-3.66)
81% (95% CI:
71-89) 71% (95% CI:
60-81) 5.02 (3.91-6.45)
The persistence of antibodies for the mock-up vaccines varies.
With the interpandemic trivalent vaccines it is usually 6-12 months, but for this vaccine no data are available yet with the H5N1 strain.
• Supportive Studies
In two dose finding studies 78 adults received an adjuvanted mock-up vaccine (H5N3 or H9N2).
Two doses of vaccine with H5N3 (A/ Duck/ Singapore/ 97) strain at 3 different dosages (7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/ dose) were administered three weeks apart.
Serum samples were tested against the original H5N3 and also a number of H5N1 isolates.
Serologic responses obtained with the SRH assay showed that 100% of subjects achieved seroprotection and 100% seroconverted after two 7.5 μ g injections.
The adjuvanted vaccine was also found to induce antibodies that cross-protected against the H5N1 strains isolated in 2003 and 2004, which exhibit some antigenic drift compared to the original strains.
Two doses of vaccine containing H9N2 (A/ chicken/ Hong Kong/ G9/ 97) strain at 4 different dosages (3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/ dose), were administered four weeks apart.
Serologic responses obtained with the Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay showed that 92% of subjects achieved seroprotection and 75% seroconverted after two 7.5 μ g injections.
Focetria has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that for scientific reasons, it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product.
The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.

These reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment.
• Post-marketing surveillance
From Post-marketing surveillance with adjuvanted interpandemic trivalent vaccines with the similar composition of Focetria (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted with MF59C.1), the following adverse events have been reported:
Uncommon (> 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100):
Generalised skin reactions including pruritus, urticaria or non-specific rash.
Rare (> 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000):
Neuralgia, paraesthesia, convulsions, transient thrombocytopenia.
Allergic reactions, in rare cases leading to shock, have been reported.
Very rare (< 1/ 10,000):
Vasculitis with transient renal involvement and exudative erythema multiforme.
Neurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome.
Adverse event(s) from post-marketing surveillance with the pandemic vaccine: not applicable.
This medicinal product contains thiomersal (an organomercuric compound) as a preservative and therefore, it is possible that sensitisation reactions may occur (see section 4.4).
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 16 Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Influenza vaccine, ATC Code:
J07BB02
This section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccines following a two-dose administration.
Mock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating influenza viruses.
These antigens can be considered as ‘ novel’ antigens and simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve.
Data obtained with a mock-up vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical efficacy and safety data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines.
A clinical trial was conducted with a H5N1 vaccine combined with MF59C.1 adjuvant in 486 healthy adult volunteers.
Two doses of vaccine containing H5N1 (A/ Vietnam/ 1194/ 2004) at 2 different dosages (7.5 and 15 µg hemagglutinin [HA]/ dose) with MF59C.1 adjuvant were administered three weeks apart.
The seroprotection rate* seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor ** for anti-HA antibody in the adults measured by SRH were as follows:
anti-HA antibody
22 days after 1st dose
21 days after 2nd dose
Seroprotection rate Seroconversion rate Seroconversion factor * measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm ** geometric mean ratios of SRH
41% (95% CI:
33-49) 39% (95% CI:
31-47) 2.42 (2.02-2.89)
86% (95% CI:
79-91) 85% (95% CI:
79-91) 7.85 (6.7-9.2)
The seroprotection rate* seroconversion rate* and the seroconversion factor ** for anti-HA antibody in subjects aged over 60 measured by SRH were as follows:
anti-HA antibody
22 days after 1st dose
21 days after 2nd dose
Seroprotection rate Seroconversion rate Seroconversion factor * measured by SRH assay ≥ 25 mm ** geometric mean ratios of SRH
53% (95% CI:
42-64) 45% (95% CI:
34-56) 2.85 (2.22-3.66)
81% (95% CI:
71-89) 71% (95% CI:
60-81) 5.02 (3.91-6.45)
The persistence of antibodies for the mock-up vaccines varies.
With the interpandemic trivalent vaccines it is usually 6-12 months, but for this vaccine no data are available yet with the H5N1 strain.
• Supportive Studies
In two dose finding studies 78 adults received an adjuvanted mock-up vaccine (H5N3 or H9N2).
Two doses of vaccine with H5N3 (A/ Duck/ Singapore/ 97) strain at 3 different dosages (7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/ dose) were administered three weeks apart.
Serum samples were tested against the original H5N3 and also a number of H5N1 isolates.
Serologic responses obtained with the SRH assay showed that 100% of subjects achieved seroprotection and 100% seroconverted after two 7.5 μ g injections.
The adjuvanted vaccine was also found to induce antibodies that cross-protected against the H5N1 strains isolated in 2003 and 2004, which exhibit some antigenic drift compared to the original strains.
Two doses of vaccine containing H9N2 (A/ chicken/ Hong Kong/ G9/ 97) strain at 4 different dosages (3.75, 7.5, 15 and 30 µg HA/ dose), were administered four weeks apart.
Serologic responses obtained with the Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay showed that 92% of subjects achieved seroprotection and 75% seroconverted after two 7.5 μ g injections.

Pharmacovigilance system
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market and for as long as the marketed product remains in use.
PSUR submission during the influenza pandemic:
During a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/ 2004 will not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time.
Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic.
Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be
21 vaccinated.
In addition, duration a pandemic, resources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Reports in the format as defined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the European Union may not be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue.
In consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared (Phase 6 of the WHO global Influenza preparedness plan) and the pandemic vaccine is used, the MAH shall submit periodic safety update reports with periodicity and format defined as follows:
Frequency of submission
- The clock will start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine.
- First data-lock point is 14 days later.
- Report submission is no later than day 22 (i. e. the following Monday).
- Reporting to be fortnightly for the first 3 months of the pandemic.
- Periodicity will be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-)Rapporteur at 3 monthly intervals.
Format The report shall include the following Tables of aggregate data using the agreed templates:
1.
Fatal and/ or life-threatening reactions – for each Preferred Term (PT), including the proportion of fatal reports
2.
3.
4.
Adverse Events of Special Interest (PTs) Serious unexpected reactions (PTs) All events occurring in the following age groups:
6-23 months, 2-8 years, 8-17 years, 18-60 years, > 60 years All events occurring in pregnant women
5.
6.
All events reported by patients that have been entered into the database by data-lock point A cumulative overview of all events reported during the period, stratified according to type of reporter (patient or health care professional), seriousness, expectedness, and whether spontaneous or solicited.
Presentation of data will take into consideration the following recommendations:
- Serious expected reactions will be reviewed by the MAH as part of their signal detection procedures
and will only form part of the report if an issue of concern arises.
- All tables will be based on number of events (presented on PT level, sorted by System Organ Class
[SOC]) and not number of cases.
- Tables 1 to 4 will be based on events reported from healthcare professionals only.
- In Tables 1 to 5, numbers will be provided for events received during the reporting period and
cumulatively.
- All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data.
Product-specific data can be
evaluated during signal work-up.
- No line listings are required – these can be provided in signal evaluation reports as necessary.
A short summary shall also be provided with the periodic safety update reports, in which any area of concern should be highlighted, signal work-up prioritised (in the event of multiple signals) and appropriate timelines for submission of a full signal evaluation report provided.
All signal evaluation reports should be provided, including those that were subsequently not identified as being signals.
A summary of vaccine distribution shall be included and provide details of the number of doses of vaccine distributed in:
i) ii) iii)
EU member states for the reporting period by batch number, EU member states cumulatively and the rest of the world

1.
WHAT FOCETRIA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Focetria is a vaccine against a pandemic influenza (flu).
It has to be used for the prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease
2.
BEFORE YOU RECEIVE FOCETRIA
Do not take Focetria if you:
- have experienced serious allergic reaction (i. e. life-threatening) to any of the constituents of Focetria,
- are allergic (hypersensitive) to influenza vaccines or any of the ingredients of Focetria,
- are allergic to eggs, chicken protein,
- are allergic to any antibiotic, formaldehyde, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and
polysorbate 80.
Take special care with Focetria if you:
- feel feverish,
- have any illness or infection,
- are having immunosuppressive therapy, e. g. corticosteroid treatment or chemotherapy for cancer, or if
you have any condition which makes you prone to infections (immunodeficiency conditions), In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR, as vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Focetria should not be given at the same time as other vaccines (if another vaccine is required at the same time, then the injection should be carried out on a different limb.
In such cases, the side effects may be more intense).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding In a severe pandemic situation, the administration of the vaccine is recommended in pregnant women, irrespective of their stage of pregnancy.
The vaccine may be used during lactation.
Driving and using machines The vaccine is unlikely to produce any effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
35 3.
HOW TO RECEIVE FOCETRIA
Your doctor or nurse administers the vaccine.
A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be injected into the upper arm (deltoid muscle).
A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Focetria can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Common (in more than 1 out of 100 people, but less than 1 in 10).
Common side effects include: redness, swelling, pain at the site of injection, bruising, hardening of the skin injection site.
In some cases the effects may also include raised temperature, malaise (generally feeling unwell), shivering, tiredness, headache, sweating, pain in muscles and joints.
These reactions usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment.
If they persist, CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR.
Uncommon:
(in more than 1 out of 1,000 people, but less than 1 in 100).
Uncommon side effects may include: generalised skin reactions including itching, bumps on the skin or a non-specific rash.
Rare (in more than 1 out of 10,000 people, but less than 1 in 1,000).
Rare side effects include: numbness or tingling sensations, involuntary muscle contractions or transient thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count in the blood which can result in bleeding or bruising).
Allergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock.
Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases.
Very rare (in less than 1 in 10,000).
Very rare side effects include: vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney problems) and exudative Stevens-Johnson syndrome (erythema multiforme).
Neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), neuritis (inflammation of nerves) and a type of paralysis known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor.
5.
HOW TO STORE FOCETRIA
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Do not use Focetria after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the label after EXP.

FURTHER INFORMATION
What Focetria contains
- Active Substance:
36 Focetria does not contain live virus particles and so it cannot cause Pandemic influenza.
The active ingredients of the vaccine are purified viral proteins (called haemagglutinin and neuraminidase).
They are isolated from the surface of influenza virus particles, which are grown in hen’ s eggs and inactivated with formaldehyde.
These viral proteins are prepared from the strain of influenza virus that complies with the WHO recommendations and EU decision in an officially declared Pandemic situation.
One dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine contains at least 7.5 micrograms of haemagglutinin from the following recommended influenza virus strain:
A/ Vietnam/ 1194/ 2004 (H5N1)
- Adjuvant:
The vaccine contains an ‘ adjuvant’ (a compound containing squalene) to stimulate a better response.
The adjuvant includes also polysorbate 80 and sorbitan trioleate in a citrate buffer.
- Other Ingredients:
The other ingredients are: sodium chloride, potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium phosphate dihydrate, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, calcium chloride dihydrate, sodium citrate, citric acid and water for injections.
What Focetria looks like and contents of the pack Focetria is a milky-white liquid.
It is provided in a ready-to-use syringe, containing a single dose (0.5 ml) for injection, Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
