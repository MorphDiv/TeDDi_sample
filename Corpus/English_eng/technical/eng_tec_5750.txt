Killbots
Classic
The rules used in the original BSD command line version of robots. Nothing fancy, just the basic game elements: no fastbots, no safe teleports, no pushing junkheaps, and a huge game grid. Due to its larger width, it is recommended that you use a theme with narrower tiles to better fit your screen.
Daleks
An approximation of the rules used in Daleks, a robots-like game for early Apple computers. The hero is allotted one energy each round that can be used to power the sonic screwdriver. All other special features are disabled.
The default Killbots game type. Includes a medium size grid, safe teleports, fast enemies and pushable junkheaps.
Easy
An easier version of the "Killbots" game type. Includes a bigger game grid prepopulated with junkheaps, a starting stash of energy and an increasing energy cap.
Energy Crisis
The player starts with 30 energy and cannot earn more. How many rounds can you survive and how many points can you collect before your energy and luck run out?

Tutorial Course
Welcome to the tutorial course for Kolf!
To hit the ball, press and hold the Down Arrow or left mouse button. How long you hold down the mouse button or key determines strength of the shot.
To aim the putter, press the Left (rotate counterclockwise) and Right (rotate clockwise) Arrow keys or use the mouse.
Bridges Bridges can have walls on the top, bottom, left, or right.
Everything Here's a hole that has it all. Have fun with Kolf! -- Jason Katz-Brown
Slopes Slopes are slanted areas of ground that push the ball in the direction that they slope. This direction is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info.
Hit the ball onto the slope and let it roll into cup.
Try out these different types of slopes.
The steepness of a slope is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info. Steepness goes from 8 (steepest) to 1 (shallowest).
Walls Bounce the ball off of the red walls.
Sand Sand is yellow, and slows your ball down.
Puddles (Water) Hitting into a puddle (blue) adds a penalty stroke to your score, and your ball is placed outside the puddle.
Windmills Windmills (brown base with moving arm) have brown walls (or half walls). The speed of the windmill arm may vary for each hole.
Black Holes Black Holes transport the ball to their exit, and eject it at a speed in direct relation to the speed your ball was traveling. Choose Hole- > Show Info to see which Black Hole goes to which exit and the direction the ball will come out.
Floaters Floaters are moving platforms that carry a ball that lands on it. Floaters' speeds vary.
