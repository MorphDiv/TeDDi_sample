The Kipi Send Images plugin is a tool for sending images directly by e-mail.
KDE
Kipi
Introduction
With this Kipi-plugin you can e-mail the selected images with your favorite e-mail agent. A resizing items operation is possible. You can use drag and drop to add more images in the list to send.
Image Selection Dialog
Upon opening of the plugin from the host application the Images window will appear with your pre-selected images already in the list to be sent. With the Add Images button a file browser opens to add more files as needed in the usual file selection manner. The image under the cursor in the list is displayed on the right side.
You can use drag and drop capability between the host application window and the image file list for add new items to e-mail.
When clicking on the second button Remove Images the selected images (highlighted in the list) will be removed from the send list.
When you have finished selecting your files, click OK to open the'new e-mail 'dialog window of your favorite e-mail client. You just need to add the addressee and the subject. The selected images will be already there as attachments.
Be sure not to overload your own or your addresses e-mail transmission limit, most providers limit the e-mail size to some megabytes of data. Use several e-mails if you want to send a lot of data.
The Image Selection Dialog
Mail Dialog
The mail dialog is used to change the settings of the images to be sent. These settings will be remembered when you close the plugin until you change them.
Select your favorite e-mail client from the drop-down menu. (If you use Thunderbird, the field below will be available to select the correct path according to your installation).
If you want to use GMail service, you need to install GMailAgent in your computer, available at this url.
If you select Add Comments in the Attached File the comments included with the images will be merged to a text file and attached in the mail.
The next 3 items allow you to set-up the image quality to be sent. Select one of those. The New Images Compression ratio can be chosen with the slider or the value box. 75% is a standard compression ratio for JPEG files. Setting compression to 100% will result in a lossless compression at the cost of the largest file size. The difference in file size between 90% and 100% can be quite dramatic, whereas the gain in quality is minor. Very good quality is already obtained with 85% compression.
The PNG format on New Images Format drop-down menu is not well adapted to reduce photographic images file size, but it is best suited for compressing lossless items like TIFF file format. PNG must be used if you use a speed internet dialup and if you want preserved the photo quality. Else, JPEG is the recommended format.
If you choose JPEG as New Images Format and if the original files were in JPEG format, then the original Exif data included is preserved in e-mailed images.
