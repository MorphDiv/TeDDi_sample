3-D View
Chart Wizard
or in the context menu of a chart you can choose a chart type.
Opens a dialogue box to edit the properties of a three dimensional view for Column, Bar, Pie, and Area charts.
For Line and X-Y (Scatter) charts you can see 3-D lines.
The chart preview responds to the new settings that you enter in the dialogue box.
When you leave the dialogue box with OK, the settings are applied permanently.
When you leave the dialogue box with Cancel or Escape, the chart returns to the state when you opened the dialogue box.
Format - 3-D View
to set perspective, appearance and illumination.
Perspective
Enter the values for rotation of the chart on the three axes and for a perspective view.
Set all angles to 0 for a front view of the chart.
Pie charts and doughnut charts are shown as circles.
With Right-angled axes enabled, you can rotate the chart contents only in x- and y-directions, that is, parallel to the chart borders.
An x value of 90, with y and z set to 0, provides a view from top down to the chart.
With x set to -90, you will see the bottom of the chart.
The rotations are applied in the order first x, then y, last z.
When shading is enabled and you rotate a chart, the lights are rotated as if they are fixed to the chart.
The rotation axes always relate to the page, not to the chart's axes.
This is different from some other chart programs.
Select the Perspective check box to view the chart in central perspective as through a camera lens instead of using a parallel projection.
Set the focus length with the spin button.
100% gives a perspective view where a far edge in the chart looks approximately half as big as a near edge.
Older versions of %PRODUCTNAME cannot display the percentage of perspective the same way as the current version.
Right-angled axes
If Right-angled axes is enabled, you can rotate the chart contents only in x- and y-directions, that is, parallel to the chart borders.
Right-angled axes is enabled by default for newly created 3-D charts.
Pie and Doughnut charts do not support right-angled axes.
X rotation
Sets the rotation of the chart on the x-axis.
The preview responds to the new settings.
Y rotation
Sets the rotation of the chart on the y-axis.
The preview responds to the new settings.
z rotation
Sets the rotation of the chart on the z-axis.
The preview responds to the new settings.
perspective
Mark the Perspective box to view the chart as through a camera lens.
Use the spin button to set the percentage.
With a high percentage nearer objects look bigger than more distant objects.
Appearance
Select a scheme from the list box.
By selecting a scheme, the check boxes and the light sources are set accordingly.
If you mark or unmark a combination of check boxes that is not given by the Realistic or Simple scheme, you create a Custom scheme.
Shading
to use the Gouraud method for rendering the surface, otherwise a flat method is used.
The flat method sets a single colour and brightness for each polygon.
The edges are visible, soft gradients and spot lights are not possible.
The Gouraud method applies gradients for a smoother, more realistic look.
Object Borders
to draw lines along the edges.
Rounded Edges
to smooth the edges of box shapes.
Scheme
Select a scheme from the list box, or mark any of the check boxes below.
Shading
Applies Gouraud shading if marked, or flat shading if unmarked.
Object borders
Shows borders around the areas by setting the line style to Solid.
Rounded Edges
Edges are rounded by 5%.
Illumination
Set the light sources for the 3-D view.
Click any of the eight buttons to switch a directed light source on or off.
By default, the second light source is switched on.
It is the first of seven &quot; normal &quot; , uniform light sources.
The light source number one projects a specular light with highlights.
For the selected light source, you can then choose a colour and intensity from the list box just below the eight buttons.
The brightness values of all lights are added, so use dark colours when you enable multiple lights.
The small preview inside this tab page has two sliders to set the vertical and horizontal position of the selected light source.
The light source always aims to the middle of the object.
The button in the corner of the small preview switches the internal illumination model between a sphere and a cube.
Use the Ambient light list box to define the ambient light which shines with a uniform intensity from all directions.
preview right bar
Drag the right slider to set the vertical height and direction of the selected light source.
preview bottom bar
Drag the bottom slider to set the horizontal position and direction of the selected light source.
preview right bottom button
Click to switch between an illumination model of a sphere or a cube.
Light source
Click to enable or disable the specular light source with highlights.
Click to enable or disable the uniform light source.
Select a colour for the selected light source.
Select a colour using the colour dialogue box.
Ambient light
Select a colour for the ambient light.
Select a colour using the colour dialogue box.
