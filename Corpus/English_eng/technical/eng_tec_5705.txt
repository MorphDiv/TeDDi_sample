Introduction
& kmplot; is a mathematical function plotter for the & kde; Desktop. It has a powerful built-in parser. You can plot different functions simultaneously and combine them to build new functions.
Examples
Examples
& kmplot; supports several different types of plots:
Explicit cartesian plots of the form y = f(x).
Parametric plots, where the x and y components are specified as functions of an independent variable.
Polar plots of the form r = r(thgr;).
Implicit plots, where the x and y coordinates are related by an expression.
Explicit differential plots.
& kmplot; also provides some numerical and visual features like:
Filling and calculating the area between the plot and the first axis
Finding maximum and minimum values
Changing function parameters dynamically
Plotting derivatives and integral functions.
These features help in learning the relationship between mathematical functions and their graphical representation in a coordinate system.
& kmplot; supports parametric functions and functions in polar coordinates. Several grid modes are supported. Plots may be printed with high precision in the correct scale.
