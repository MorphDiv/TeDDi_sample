(PHP 3, PHP 4)
mysql_free_result() will free all memory associated with the result identifier result.
mysql_free_result() only needs to be called if you are concerned about how much memory is being used for queries that return large result sets.
All associated result memory is automatically freed at the end of the script 's execution.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
For downward compatibility mysql_freeresult() can also be used.
This is deprecated, however.
