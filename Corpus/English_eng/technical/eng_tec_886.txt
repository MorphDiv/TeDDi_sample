Working with Groups
You can combine several graphic objects into a group so that you can use them like a single object.
You can move, transform, resize, distort, or convert all objects in a group together, and you can enter the group any time to change the individual objects.
You can change the properties (line size, fill colour, and more) of all objects in a group together, and you can enter the group and change the individual objects.
Groups can also be nested to form groups within other groups.
To group objects
Select the objects together that you want to group.
Hold down Shift while you click the individual objects.
Right-click any of the selected objects to open the context menu.
In Impress or Draw, choose Group.
In Calc or Writer, choose Group â€“ Group.
To select the objects, you can also drag a selection frame around the objects.
For example, you can group all of the objects in a company logo to move and resize the logo as a single object.
After you have grouped objects, selecting any part of the group selects the entire group.
To enter a group
Right-click any object of the group.
In Impress or Draw, choose Enter Group.
In Calc or Writer, choose Group - Edit Group.
Now you can select and edit a single object in the group.
You can add or delete objects to and from a group in this mode.
The objects that are not part of the group are shown with dimmed colours.
To exit a group
Right-click any object of the group.
In Impress or Draw, choose Exit Group.
In Calc or Writer, choose Group - Exit Group.
To exit a group in Draw or Impress, you can also double-click anywhere outside the group.
To ungroup a group
Right-click any object of the group.
In Impress or Draw, choose Ungroup.
In Calc or Writer, choose Group - Ungroup.
Now you can select and edit all objects as individual objects.
