The data fields are divided by separators.
Text in the data fields is divided by quotation marks.
Path to text files
Enter the path to the text file or files.
If you just want one text file, you can use any extension of the file name.
If you enter a folder name, the text files in that folder must have the extension *.csv to be recognised as files of the text database.
Browse
Click to open a file selection dialogue box.
Plain text files (*.txt)
Click to access txt files.
'Comma separated value' files (*.csv)
Click to access csv files.
Custom
Click to access custom files.
Enter the extension in the text box.
Field separator

Text separator
Enter or select the character that identifies a text field in the text file.

Thousands separator
Enter or select the character that is used as a thousands separator in the text file, for example a comma (1,000), or a dot-on-the-line (1.000).
