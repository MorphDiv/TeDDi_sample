Introduction
& kapptemplate; generates & kde; templates to help you start easily & kde; programming.
& kapptemplate; offers you a few basic templates projects and also picks up KDevelop templates if some are installed on your machine.
As default you will find:
A simple & kde; 4 & GUI; template
A & kde; 4 KPart template
A Qt4 main window based template
A PyQt4 application
A Pykde; 4 application
A Ruby (korundum4) template
A plasma applet template
Answer the wizard questions on each page and generate your template.
A README file in each template will allow you to find out how to build the template. It will also give you links for tutorials related to the project. After the project is generated, & kapptemplate; 's job is finished and you are on your own to build it.
Using & kapptemplate;
& kapptemplate; is a wizard. The first page of the wizard explains you that & kapptemplate; will generate a base project. Click Next to start generating your project. Cancel will stop the program and quit it. Help will display this help handbook in & khelpcenter;.
