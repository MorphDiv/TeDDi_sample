Network configuration This module allows you to configure your TCP/ IP settings.

Advanced Device Information
Set advanced setting for the network device
Description:
IP address of the network device
Broadcast:
Simply enter a short human-readable description for this device
The Broadcast is a special address. All devices of a network respond if packages are sent to this address.
Configure Interface
TCP/ IP Address
Netmask:
The netmask defines a range of IP numbers which will build a subnet inside the network.
IP address:
An IP address is an unique identifier of a networking device in an TCP/ IP network
IP address for the network device
Here you should enter the IP address for the network interface. Please note: If your network is connected to the internet, you should only enter IP addresses you have been given by your provider. Otherwise, you should enter one of the IP addresses which are explicitly reserved for private use. Most small private networks use class C networks, which allow up to 255 computers in your network. So simply use addresses like 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.171 and so on for your computers. Class C networks: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255, for example 192.168.0.13. Class B networks: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, for example 172.28.2.5 Class A networks: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, for example 10.5.12.14 Please ensure that all IP addresses you give to your computers are unique; you will have many problems if the same address is assigned to more than one network device.
Subnetmask of the network device
Please enter the desired subnetmask for the interface here. For small private networks, 255.255.255.0 will most often be a reasonable default value. This field will change from a popup box to a combo box as soon as you enable the advanced settings below.
255.255.255.0
255.255.0.0
255.0.0.0
255.255.255.128
255.255.255.192
255.255.255.240
255.255.255.248
The boot protocol this network device should use
dhcp
bootp
Manual:
Use a static IP address. Use the fields below to enter the values
Sets this interface to use static IP settings. In this case, please use the fields below to enter the desired values manually.
Automatic:
Use a dynamic IP address
Using an dynamic IP address causes this device to get a free IP address automatically. The interface will try to contact an DHCP- or BOOTP-Server during the boot process. Rendevouz is not supported yet.
Activate when the computer starts
Ensures that this interface gets activated during boot time
Ensures that this interface gets activated during boot time. Otherwise, you will have to active the interface manually after you have logged in after the boot process.
