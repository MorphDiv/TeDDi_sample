Introduction
This module is used to configure desktop effects for & kde;.
This panel is divided into three tabs: General, All Effects and Advanced.
General tab
At the top of this tab is a checkbox labeled Enable desktop effects. If there is no mark in front of this checkbox, then all visual effects of this panel are disabled. To edit any of these effects, simply place a mark in this checkbox.
Below that checkbox there are some common settings for the desktop effects like improved window management, shadows, various animations, effects for desktop and window switching and the animation speed.
All Effects tab

Advanced tab
On this tab you can select a Compositing type (OpenGL or XRender) and set some options for the selected type.
