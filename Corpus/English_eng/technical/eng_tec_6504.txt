Temperature unit
The unit of temperature used for showing weather. Valid values are 'kelvin', 'centigrade' and 'fahrenheit'.
Distance unit
The unit of distance used for showing weather (for example for visibility or for distance of important events). Valid values are 'meters', 'km' and 'miles'.
Speed unit
The unit of speed used for showing weather (for example for wind speed). Valid values are 'ms' (meters per second), 'kph' (kilometers per hour), 'mph' (miles per hour), 'knots' and 'bft' (Beaufort scale).
Pressure unit
The unit of pressure used for showing weather. Valid values are 'kpa' (kilopascal), 'hpa' (hectopascal), 'mb' (millibar, mathematically equivalent to 1 hPa but shown differently), 'mm-hg' (millimiters of mercury), 'inch-hg' (inches of mercury), 'atm' (atmospheres).
Default location
The default location for the weather applet. The first field is the name that will be shown. If empty, it will be taken from the locations database. The second field is the METAR code for the default weather station. It must not be empty and must correspond to a &lt;codegt; tag in the Locations.xml file. The third field is a tuple of (latitude, longitude), to override the value taken from the database. This is only used for sunrise and moon phase calculations, not for weather forecast.
