Scissors tool
Intelligent Scissors tool icon in the Toolbox
The Intelligent Scissors tool is an interesting piece of equipment: it has some features in common with the Lasso, some features in common with the Path tool, and some features all its own. It is useful when you are trying to select a region defined by strong color-changes at the edges. To use the Scissors, you click to create a set of "control nodes", also referred to as anchors or control points, at the edges of the region you are trying to select. The tool produces a continuous curve passing through these control nodes, following any high-contrast edges it can find. If you are lucky, the path that the tool finds will correspond to the contour you are trying to select.
Unfortunately, there seem to be some problems with the edge-following logic for this tool, with the result that the selections it creates tend to be pretty crude in a lot of cases. A good way to clean them up is to switch to

Holding down this key while clicking and dragging disables this feature, and the control node will be placed at the position of the mouse pointer.
Tool handling
Using Intelligent Scissors
Each time you left-click with the mouse, you create a new control point, which is connected to the last control point by a curve that tries to follow edges in the image. To finish, click on the first point (the cursor changes to indicate when you are in the right spot). You can adjust the curve by dragging the control nodes, or by clicking to create new control nodes. When you are satisfied, click anywhere inside the curve to convert it into a selection.
As said above when you click with this tool you drop points. The selection boundary is driven by these control points. During creation you can move each one by clicking and dragging, except the first and the last one. The selection is closed when you are clicking the last point over the first one. When the selection is closed the pointer shape changes according to its position: inside
You have to notice that you can get only one selection; if you create a second selection, the first one is erased when you validate the second one.
Be sure not to click inside the curve until you are completely done adjusting it. Once you have converted it into a selection, undoing takes you back to zero, and you will have to start constructing the curve again from scratch if you need to change it. Also be sure not to switch to a different tool, or again all of your carefully created control nodes will be lost. (But you still can transform your selection into a path and work it with the Path tool.)
To move the selection, see

If this option is enabled, dragging a control node during placement will indicate the path that will be taken by the selection boundary. If it is not enabled, the node will be shown connected to the previous node by a straight line while you are dragging it around, and you won't see the resulting path until you release the pointer button. On slow systems, if your control nodes are far apart, this may give a bit of a speed-up.

Magic Wand
Magic Wand tool icon in the Toolbox
The Fuzzy Select (Magic Wand) tool is designed to select areas of the current layer or image based on color similarity.
When using this tool, it is very important to pick the right starting point. If you select the wrong spot, you might get something very different from what you want, or even the opposite.
The Wand is a good tool for selecting objects with sharp edges. It is fun to use, so beginners often start out using it a lot. You will probably find, however, that the more you use it, the more frustrated you become with the difficulty of selecting exactly what you want, no more, no less. More experienced users find that the

Using Magic Wand tool: selected pixels are contiguous
It starts selecting when you click at a spot in the image, and expands outwards like water flooding low-lying areas, selecting contiguous pixels whose colors are similar to the starting pixel. You can control the threshold of similarity by dragging the mouse downward or to the right: the farther you drag it, the larger you get the selected region. And you can reduce the selection by dragging upwards or to the left.
To move the selection see

Select Transparent Areas
This option gives the Magic Wand the ability to select areas that are completely transparent. If this option is not checked, transparent areas will never be included in the selection.

This option becomes relevant when you have several layers in your image, and the active layer is either semi-transparent or is set to another Layer Mode than Normal. If this is the case, the colors present in the layer will be different from the colors in the composite image. If the
Threshold
This slider determines the range of colors that will be selected at the moment you click the pointer on the initial point, before dragging it: the higher the threshold, the larger the resulting selection. After the first button-press, dragging the pointer downward or to the right will increase the size of the selection; dragging upward or to the left will decrease it. Thus, you have the same set of possibilities regardless of the Threshold setting: what differs is the amount of dragging you have to do to get the result you want.

Free Selection icon in the Toolbox
The Free Selection tool, or Lasso, lets you create a selection by drawing it free-hand with the pointer, while holding down the left mouse button (or, for a stylus, pressing it against the tablet). When you release the mouse button, the selection is closed by connecting the current pointer location to the start location with a straight line. You can go outside the edge of the image display and come back in if you want to. The Lasso is often a good tool to use for

The Free Selection tool is much easier to use with a tablet than with a mouse.
A new possibility came up with GIMP-2.6: the polygonal selection. Instead of click-and-dragging to draw a free hand selection, you can click only. This creates an anchor point. Then moving the mouse pointer draws a line with a new anchor point that you can move as long as you don't click again (the mouse pointer comes with the moving cross). Clicking again anchors this point and creates a segment. By pressing the

Selection tools are designed to select regions from the active layer so you can work on them without affecting the unselected areas.

Replace mode will cause any existing selection to be destroyed or replaced when the new selection is created.

Subtract mode will remove the new selection area from any existing selection regions.
