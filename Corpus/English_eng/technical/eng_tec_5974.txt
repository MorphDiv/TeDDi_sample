Konqueror
Behavior
General & konqueror; Behavior
On this page you find settings for home and start page and the behavior of tabbed browsing both for & konqueror; 's file manager and browser mode.
When Konqueror starts
This option determines which page is displayed when & konqueror; starts, the introduction page, your home page, a blank page or your bookmarks page.
Home page
This is the & URL; (eg; a folder or a web page) where & konqueror; in browser mode will jump to when the Home Page button in the toolbar is pressed. You can set a path that is your Home page by typing into the text field, or using the browse icon to select a local folder. & konqueror; needs to be restarted for changes to take effect.
When & konqueror; is used in file manager mode, the Home Page button in the toolbar is replaced by a Home Folder button which makes it jump to your local home folder instead.
Open links in new tab instead of in new window
& konqueror; defaults to a single window per page, but has the capability to open multiple tabs inside a single window. & konqueror; also, by default, has a & MMB; shortcut to open any link in a new window. If you enable Open links in new tab instead of in new window you can & MMB; click on a link to have it open in a new tab.
Open popups in new tab instead of in new window
Whether or not JavaScript popups if allowed shall open in a new tab or in a new window.
Open as tab in existing Konqueror when URL is called externally
When you click a & URL; in another & kde; program or call kfmclient to open a & URL;, the current desktop will be searched for a non-minimized & konqueror; and, if found, the & URL; opened as a new tab within it. Otherwise a new & konqueror; window will be opened with the required & URL;.
Open new tabs in the background
If you are using tabbed browsing, you can choose if a newly opened tab becomes the active (front) tab, or goes to the back. On a slow Internet connection, or while browsing a page that has a list of headlines or other links in a list, you may like to have the new tabs load in the background while you continue reading. In this case, enable this setting. If you prefer to go straight to the new page, leaving the old one in the background to return to later, disable it.
Open new tab after current tab
This will open a new tab opened from a page after the current tab, instead of after the last tab.
Hide the tab bar when only one tab is open
This will display the tab bar only if there are two or more tabs. Otherwise it will always be displayed.
Show close button on tabs
This will display close buttons inside each tab instead of websites' icons.
Middle-click on a tab to close it
When you click on a tab using the middle mouse button or mouse wheel, it will close that tab. & konqueror; needs to be restarted for changes to take effect.
Confirm when closing windows with multiple tabs
If you close a window in & konqueror; that has multiple tabs open, & konqueror; will ask you if you're sure that you meant to close it. You can toggle on and off this behavior with the Confirm when closing windows with multiple tabs check box.
Activate previously used tab when closing the current tab
When checking this the previous used or opened tab will be activated when you close the current active tab instead of the one right to the current tab.
