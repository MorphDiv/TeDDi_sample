An initial dose of 2 mg/ kg (2.0 ml/ 100 kg) is followed by a maintenance dose of 1 mg/ kg (1.0 ml/ 100 kg) given every 12 hours.
Treatment can be continued for a maximum of 14 consecutive days.
In case of prophylactic treatment, a maximum duration of treatment of 7 consecutive days is sufficient.
Bodyweight and dosage must be accurately determined to avoid overdosing.
The gel is administered orally by inserting the nozzle of the syringe through the interdental space and depositing the required amount of gel on the back of the tongue.
Before administration, the syringe should be adjusted to the calculated dosage by setting the ring on the plunger.
It is advisable to administer the product before feeding.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
ATCvet code:
QM01AE90
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Vedaprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) belonging to the propionic acid derivate group.
Vedaprofen inhibits the prostaglandin synthesis enzyme system (cyclo-oxygenase enzyme) and thus possesses anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties.
Studies in the horse have demonstrated potent inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PG E2) synthesis in exudate and thromboxane B2 synthesis in serum and exudate.
Vedaprofen contains an asymmetric carbon atom and, therefore, is a racemic mixture of a (+) enantiomer and a (-) enantiomer.
Both enantiomers contribute to therapeutic actions of the compound.
The (+) enantiomer is more potent in inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.
Both enantiomers are equipotent PGF2α antagonists.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Vedaprofen is rapidly absorbed following oral administration.
Bioavailability after oral administration is 80-90%, but is reduced significantly if medication is administered with food.
The terminal half-life following oral administration is 350-500 minutes and no accumulation occurs following repeated oral dosing.
Steady state is reached quickly following onset of treatment.
Vedaprofen is highly bound to plasma proteins and extensively metabolised.
The most abundant metabolite is a monohydroxylated derivative.
All metabolites of vedaprofen were shown to be less active than the parent compound as determined by a thromboxane B2 formation inhibition assay.
Approximately 70% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine.
