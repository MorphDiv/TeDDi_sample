For to make coarse mesh texture, increase the ribbon spacing and/or decrease the ribbon width.
For to strain ribbons hard, decrease the shadow depth.
Ribbon width
With this option you can set the tape width in pixel between 0.0 and 256.0. In default, 30.0 pixels is set.
Ribbon spacing
With this option you can set the distance to the neighboring ribbon or the size of black square hole in pixel between 0.0 and 256.0. In default, 10.0 pixels is set.
Shadow darkness
With this option you can set the darkness at crossings of lower ribbon in percentage. Lower value shows ribbons thinner. 75.0 percent is the default value.
Shadow depth
With this option you can set the bent strength of ribbons in percentage. Higher value shows ribbons more wavy, lower value for flat surface. The actual effect is limited by the
Thread length
With this option you can set the regularity of stripe texture. If this value is shorter than the summary of the ribbon width and twice of the ribbon spacing, the surface of ribbon becomes speckled. Set this value in pixel on range between 0.0 to 256.0. The default value is 200.0.
Thread density
With this option you can set the density of fiber-like parallel short stripes on the surface of ribbons. To populate stripes increase this value. 50.0 percent is the default value.
Thread intensity
With this option you can set the opacity of stripe texture. Lower value shows threads vague. To clear off threads set the value to 0.0 percent. The default value is 100.0 percent.

From left to right: original image, map, resulting image
Map has three stripes: a solid black area, a vertical gradient area, a solid white area. One can see, on the resulting image, that image zones corresponding to solid areas of the map, are not blurred. Only the image zone corresponding to the gradient area of the map is blurred.

It uses a blur map. Unlike other maps, this filter doesn't use grey levels of this blur map.

Convolve
You can use two types of convolution. That's the first parameter you have to set:
With white noise
White noise is an acoustics name. It's a noise where all frequencies have the same amplitude. Here, this option is used to create patterns.
With source image
The source image will be blurred.
Effect image
That's the map for blur or pattern direction. This map must have the same dimensions as the original image. It must be preferably a grayscale image. It must be present on your screen when you call filter so that you can choose it in the drop-list.
Blurring with vertical gradient map
With a vertical gradient map, vertical lines are blurred.
Blurring with a square gradient map
The gradient map is divided into four gradient triangles: each of them has its own gradient direction. In every area of the image corresponding to gradient triangles, only lines with the same direction as gradient are blurred.
Texture example
The
Filter length
When applying blur, this option controls how important blur is. When creating a texture, it controls how rough texture is: low values result in smooth surface; high values in rough surface.
Action example of Filter Length on blur
On the left: a vertical line, one pixel wide (zoom 800%). On the right: the same line, after applying a vertical blur with a Filter Length to 3. You can see that blur width is 6 pixels, 3 pixels on both sides.
Filter Length example on texture
On the left: a texture with Filter Length=3. On the right, the same texture with Filter Length=24.
Noise magnitude
This options controls the amount and size of White Noise. Low values produce finely grained surfaces. High values produce coarse-grained textures.
Action example of Noise Magnitude on texture
Noise magnitude = 4
Integration steps
This options controls the influence of gradient map on texture.
Action example of Integration Steps on texture
On the left: Integration Steps = 2. On the right: Integration Steps = 4.
Minimum value
Maximum value
Both values determine a range controlling texture contrast: shrunk range results in high contrast and enlarged range results in low contrast.
Action example of min/max values on texture
Minimum value = -4.0. Maximum value = 5.0.

Mask radius
This parameter controls the size of the pixel neighbourhood over which the average intensity is computed and then compared to each pixel in the neighborhood to decide whether or not to darken it. Large values result in very thick black areas bordering the regions of white and much less detail for black areas. Small values result in less toner overall and more details everywhere.
With this option, you can set photocopy sharpness, from 0.0 to 1.0.
Percent black
This parameter controls the amount of black color added to the image. Small values make the blend from color regions to blackened areas smoother and dark lines themselves thinner and less noticeable. Larger values make the lines thicker, darker and sharper. The maximum value makes the lines aliased. The best, most natural results are usually achieved with an intermediate value. Values vary from 0.0 to 1.0.

Example for the

The Cubism plug-in modifies the image so that it appears to be constructed of small squares of semitransparent tissue paper.

You can find this filter through

Tile size
This variable determines the size, in pixels, of the squares to be used. This is, in effect, the size of the little squares of tissue paper used in generating the new image. The slider can be used, the exact pixel size can be entered into the text box, or the arrow buttons can be used.
Tile saturation
This variable specifies how intense the color of the squares should be. This affects the opacity of the squares. A high value will render the squares very intensely and does not allow lower squares to show through. A lower value allows the lower squares to be more visible through the higher ones and causes more blending in the colors. If this is set to 0 and Use Background Color is not checked, the entire layer will be rendered black. If it is checked and the value here is zero, the background color will fill the entire layer.
Use background color
This filter creates its tiles from all the colors of the image and paint them with a color scale which depends on the Tile Saturation. With a low Tile Saturation, this color scale lets the background color appear: default is black as you can see by setting Tile Saturation to 0. When this option is checked, the background color of the Toolbox is used. If your image has an Alpha channel, this color scale will also be transparent.

You can place one or several vectors. You can set their direction and their strength. They will act on the corresponding area of the image.
Vectors
In the left windows (Vectors) you can manage your vectors. By default, a vector is at center. Vectors are red when they are active, and grey when they are not with a white point at tip.

This Preview gives you an idea of the action of the various vectors. The slider on the right border lets you change the luminosity of this preview.
Type
You have there some types to arrange the brush strokes within the selected vector domain. Describing them is difficult, but you can see the result in the Preview.
A Voronoi's diagram consists in partitioning a plane with n master points into n polygons where each polygon has only one of these n master points and where any given other point of the polygon is closer to the master point than to any other. So each polygon limit is midway between two master point. Here is an example of a Voronoi's diagram:
Angle
Direction of the selected vector. This slider has the same action as right-clicking (see above).

This slider acts on the influence domain of the selected vector. This influence lowers with distance. Strength is showed with the vector length.
