Shortcuts
Opens a dialog which allows you to configure the & krusader; key bindings.
With the Import shortcuts and Export shortcuts buttons you can load and save a Key-binding profile. This allows & krusader; to have the Total Commander, Midnight Commander, foo-commander, or your custom Key-bindings. The only limitation is that global & kde; key-bindings and some & krusader; key-bindings can not be changed yet, as well as some features in foo-commander that we either do not have or need. The Key-bindings are stored in $KDEDIR/ share/ apps/ krusader, foo. keymap. info contains a description, foo. keymap is an ini file that holds the Key-bindings. Until & krusader; -1.70.1 this was a binary file, & krusader; is backwards compatible for importing this legacy binary format. If a *. keymap. info text file exists, & krusader; will display it, showing additional information regarding the loaded Key-bindings file. Here you have a chance to exit without importing the proposed Key-bindings file.
A Total Commander Key-bindings file is provided. Please upload your favorite Key-bindings schemes so that they become available for the & krusader; community. Thanks!
