Actions for new devices
Introduction
This module allows you to set up the actions you want to associate when you plug new devices.

You will see listed all of the possible actions that are available when devices are plugged in. Please note that they will only be available under certain conditions.
Add This will ask you to supply a name for your new action, then will open that action for editing. If you do not supply all the required details in that dialog, then your action will be deleted.
Edit This will allow you to change the Name, Icon, command to execute and the conditions the action must match to be shown.
Discard / Cannot be deleted / Remove This will do different actions, depending on if it was supplied with your system or created by you. You can only discard changes to system wide actions, if there are no changes then these actions cannot be deleted. User created actions are completely removed, including all changes.
Add Action
The Add button brings you a dialog to enter the new action name.

The action name should correctly describe the action. After entering a name and clicking OK, the Edit Action dialog will show to allow you to set up the action properties.
Edit Action
This dialog allows you to change the settings of the action you selected.

This includes the icon, the action name, the action command and the various parameters. You can change the icon by clicking on it.
The parameters are displayed in a tree, the top item having to be true in order for the action to be shown.
Edit parameter
Parameter type
This controls what can be contained inside it, or what matching is performed to check if it is true.
Property Match
Compares the specified property of the Device (using Device type and Value name) and using the evaluator, compares it against the text provided.
Content Conjunction
All sub-properties of this must be true for it to be true itself.
Content Disjunction
Any sub-property of this may be true for it to be true itself.
Device interface match
Checks to see if the Device can be classed as the selected Device type.
Device type
These are the possible device types supported by & kde; on your system. They are used in both Property and Device interface matches.
Value name
This is a list of all possible property names for the selected device type. It also provides the selection of the value evaluator (which is either Equals or Contains), and allows entry of the text to be compared with.
Reset Parameter
Reverts any unsaved changes you have made to this parameter.
Save Parameter changes
Saves the changes you have made to the parameter.
This includes the icon, the action name, the action command and the various requirements. You can change the icon by clicking on it. The requirements are displayed in a tree, the top item having to be true in order for the action to be shown. Each item can be either a "Container" or a "Requirement", which is selected when that item was added. Only Containers can have items below them.
Containers can be one of two types, which will determine how they match their conditions. Either all or at least one of the conditions must match.
Requirements can also be different types. If the device matches them, they are true, otherwise they are false.
Add Requirement
This is only available for containers and allows you to select type of the requirement, and provide some of its initial details.
Edit Requirement
This can only be performed when a valid item is selected. It allows you to edit the various details of that particular item type.
Delete Requirement
This is available for all items, except the root item. If a container contains any requirements, they will also be deleted.
Edit Requirement
This dialog allows you to change the various details about a container and will display different information, depending on what type of item it is.
Container Type
You can only change one setting, the logic match. This is either "All must match" or "Any can match". This will be used when determining if the container is true.
This has many settings, with additional ones available for some sub-types.
Restriction Type
Only two settings are available: Is Value Type and Compare Value To. Is Value Type checks to ensure the device is of the selected device type. Compare Value To compares a value of the device with what you specify.
You can select the device type here. This is used for limiting the selection of values for comparing values, and direct matches for the device type selected.
This is only visible for "Compare value to". It allows you to select a device value to check.
Equals/ Does Not Equal
This determines what kind of match we are looking for when comparing the value. The text to check is specified beside it.
