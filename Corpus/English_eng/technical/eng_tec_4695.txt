(PHP 4)
session_start() creates a session or resumes the current one based on the current session id that's being passed via a request, such as GET, POST, or a cookie.
If you want to use a named session, you must call session_name() before calling session_start().
This function always returns TRUE.
Note:
If you are using cookie-based sessions, you must call session_start() before anything is output to the browser.
session_start() will register internal output handler for URL rewriting when trans-sid is enabled.
If a user uses ob_gzhandler or like with ob_start(), the order of output handler is important for proper output.
For example, user must register ob_gzhandler before session start.
Note:
Use of zlib.output_compression is recommended rather than ob_gzhandler()
