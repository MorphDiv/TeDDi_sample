EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
METACAM
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report.
Its purpose is to explain how the assessment done by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) on the basis of the documentation provided, led to the recommendations on the conditions of use.
This document cannot replace a face-to-face discussion with your veterinarian.
If you need more information about your animal’ s medical condition or treatment, contact your veterinarian.
If you want more information on the basis of the CVMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Metacam?
Metacam exists as an oral suspension (0.5 mg/ ml, 1.5 mg/ ml and 15 mg/ ml), a solution for injection (5 mg/ ml and 20 mg/ ml) and chewable tablets (1 mg and 2.5 mg).
What is Metacam used for?
Metacam is used to relieve inflammation and pain in both acute and chronic musculo-skeletal disorders.
Metacam is used in cattle for acute respiratory infection with appropriate antibiotic therapy to reduce clinical signs; use in diarrhoea in combination with oral re-hydration therapy to reduce clinical signs in calves of over one week of age and young, non-lactating cattle and as supportive therapy in the treatment of acute mastitis, in combination with antibiotics.
In pigs indications are use in non-infectious locomotor disorders to reduce the symptoms of lameness and inflammation and for supportive therapy in the treatment of septicaemia and toxaemia around farrowing (mastitis-metritis-agalactia syndrome) with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
Metacam is used in horses and dogs for the relief of inflammation and relief of pain in both acute and chronic musculo-skeletal disorders.
In horses, Metacam is also used for the relief of pain associated with colic.
In dogs Metacam is also used to reduce post-operative pain and inflammation following orthopaedic and soft tissue surgery.
The indication in cats is reduction of post-operative pain after a spay operation and minor soft tissue surgery.

Metacam contains meloxicam, which belongs to a class of medicines called non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Meloxicam acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.
As the prostaglandins are substances that trigger inflammation, pain, exudation and fever, meloxicam reduces those responses.
How has the effectiveness of Metacam been studied?
Appropriate studies have been made to show the effectiveness in the various target animals.
What are the side effects of Metacam?
In cattle and pigs, subcutaneous, intramuscular as well as intravenous administration is well tolerated; only a slight temporary swelling at the injection site following subcutaneous administration was observed in less than 10% of the cattle treated in clinical studies.
In horses, anaphylactoid (hypersentivity) reactions can occur and should be treated symptomatically.
A temporary swelling at the injection site can occur but resolves without intervention.
In dogs and cats, occasional side effects of Metacam are those seen with NSAIDs, such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, blood appearing in the stools and apathy (lack of vitality).
In dogs, these side effects occur usually within the first week of treatment and are generally transient (temporary).
They disappear once treatment has stopped.
In very rare cases, they may be serious or fatal.
What are the precautions for the person who gives the medicine or comes into contact with the animal?
People who are hypersensitive (allergic) to NSAIDs should avoid contact with Metacam.
If the product is accidentally swallowed by a person, the advice of a doctor should be sought immediately.
What is the time to allow before the animal can be slaughtered and the meat used for human consumption (withdrawal period)?
After the last administration of Metacam cattle should not be slaughtered for 15 days and the milk not used for 5 days.
Pigs and horses should not be slaughtered for 5 days.
Why has Metacam been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) decided that the benefits of Metacam are greater than any risks of treatment and they recommended that Metacam should be given a marketing authorisation.
The benefit-risk balance may be found in module 6 of this EPAR.
Other information about Metacam:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Metacam to Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Germany on 7 January 1998.
Information on the prescription status of this product may be found on the label of the carton.
