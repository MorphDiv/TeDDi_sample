List Box Wizard:
Field Link
Indicates through which fields tables of values and list tables are linked.
The value table is the table of the current form where the list field is inserted.
The list table is the table whose data is to be shown in the list field.
Both tables must be linked over a mutual data field.
These links are to be entered on this page of the Wizard.
The field names must not necessarily be the same (this depends upon how the field names are defined in both tables), but both fields must have the same field type.
