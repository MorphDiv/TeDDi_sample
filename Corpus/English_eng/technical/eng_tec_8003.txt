EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
OPTIMARK
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is OptiMARK?
OptiMARK is a solution for injection that contains the active substance gadoversetamide.
It is available in a pre-filled syringe and in a vial (500 micromoles per millilitre).
What is OptiMARK used for?
OptiMARK is for diagnostic use.
It is used in patients who are undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a special type of scan where images of the internal organs are taken.
OptiMARK is used to obtain a clearer scan in patients who have, or are thought to have abnormalities in the brain, spine or liver.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is OptiMARK used?
OptiMARK should only be given by a doctor who has experience in using MRI.
It is given as an intravenous injection (into a vein) of 100 micromoles per kilogram body weight.
OptiMARK allows images to be taken for up to an hour, although the best time to take a scan after injection depends on the location and type of abnormality that is being examined.
When looking at certain abnormalities in the brain, OptiMARK may need to be used at a higher dose, or the dose may need to be repeated.
OptiMARK is not recommended for use in children below 2 years of age, because of a lack of information on safety and effectiveness in this group.
How does OptiMARK work?
The active substance in OptiMARK, gadoversetamide, contains gadolinium, a ‘ rare earth’ metal element.
Gadolinium is used as a ‘ contrast enhancer’ to help obtain better images with MRI scans.
MRI is an imaging method that relies on the tiny magnetic fields produced by water molecules in the body.
Once injected, gadolinium interacts with the water molecules.
As a result of this interaction, the water molecules give a stronger signal, and this helps to obtain a brighter picture.
In OptiMARK, the gadolinium is bound to another chemical in a ‘ chelate ’ (a type of chemical) so that the metal is not released in the body but stays ‘ trapped’ in the chelate until it is eliminated from the body in the urine.
How has OptiMARK been studied?
The effects of OptiMARK were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
OptiMARK has been studied in four main studies involving a total of 804 adults who had, or were thought to have abnormalities in the brain or spine (two studies in 401 patients) or in the liver (two 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

In all studies, the effects of OptiMARK were compared with those of gadopentetate dimeglumine (another contrast agent containing gadolinium).
The main measure of effectiveness was the difference in the ability to see the abnormalities on MRI scans taken with and without the contrast agent.
Each scan’ s clarity was scored on a four-point scale.
The scans were analysed by three radiologists (specialised physicians) who did not know what treatment the patient had received beforehand, to make sure the findings were as accurate as possible.
What benefit has OptiMARK shown during the studies?
In all studies, OptiMARK was as effective as the comparator contrast agent in improving the ability to see abnormalities on the scans.
Both medicines were associated with similar improvements in the score given to the scans.
In the two studies of brain and spine abnormalities taken together, scans taken with OptiMARK had a score increase of 0.63 points on average (from a ‘ baseline ’ of 1.58 points without OptiMARK).
This compared with a very similar increase of 0.66 points with the comparator contrast agent, from a baseline of 1.60 points.
In the studies of liver abnormalities, both medicines increased the score by an average of 0.38 points from a baseline of 1.82 points.
What is the risk associated with OptiMARK?
The most common side effects with OptiMARK (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are dizziness, headaches, dysgeusia (taste disturbances) and feeling hot.
For the full list of all side effects reported with OptiMARK, see the Package Leaflet.
OptiMARK should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to gadoversetamide, any of the other ingredients or other medicines containing gadolinium.
It should also not be used in patients who have severe problems with their kidneys or in liver transplant patients, due to a risk of a condition called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), which causes thickening of the skin and connective tissues.
Why has OptiMARK been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that OptiMARK’ s benefits are greater than its risks for use with MRI of the central nervous system and liver.
The Committee recommended that OptiMARK be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about OptiMARK:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for OptiMARK to Tyco Healthcare Deutschland GmbH on 23 July 2007.
