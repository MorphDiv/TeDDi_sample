Introduction
& kwordquiz; is a tool that gives you a powerful way to master new vocabularies. It may be a language or any other kind of terminology.
Easy to use
With & kwordquiz; you build your own vocabulary documents in a simple and intuitive way. The basic layout is a two-column spreadsheet where you type vocabulary entries in one form that you know and in another form that you want to learn. You change the titles of the columns to reflect what you are practicing.
Practice modes
Before you start a quiz you select how you want to practice. & kwordquiz; offers five different modes to make practicing more efficient. The different modes make it possible to have the quiz go through your vocabulary in sequential or random order in one or both directions.
Quiz types
When you have entered your vocabulary and selected a mode you are ready to start a quiz. Maybe you want to start with a flashcard session, then you can move on to a multiple choice quiz or do the powerful question and answer quiz. You get instant feedback on correct and incorrect answers and you have the option to repeat any errors, further improving your learning efficiency. If you need a little extra help you can use the hint function.
Vocabulary documents
& kwordquiz; can open several types of vocabulary data. The default format is. kvtml, a file format shared by several & kde; programs. & kwordquiz; can also open. wql files created by & kwordquiz; for & Windows;,. csv files with comma separated text, and. xml. gz files created by Pauker (http: / /pauker. sourceforge. net).
& kwordquiz; can save your vocabulary documents several different formats. The default is the. kvtml format used by other & kde; programs. Another available option is comma separated text. csv.
You can have several files open at the same time and easily copy or move entries between files.

The Main Window
The Main Window
The Vocabulary Editor
The vocabulary document area has the appearance of a spreadsheet-like grid. The grid consists of cells organized in two columns and a number of rows. Each column and row has a header. The column headers are used to specify the titles of the vocabulary document. They can be set by selecting Vocabulary Column Titles.... The row headers number the rows consecutively.
The column headers can also be used to sort the vocabulary. Simply click on the header of the column you want to sort by.
You can click in a cell of the grid to make it the active cell. You can select several cells for copying or other editing by dragging over them with the left mouse button down. To select entire rows click in the header.
The Vocabulary Editor
The Vocabulary Editor
In the document you build a vocabulary of pair-wise entries in the two columns. You can enter text into the active cell simply by starting to type. The cell will now be in edit mode and you can select all or part of the text. You can also edit a cell by double-clicking it or pressing F2 and make changes directly in the cell.
When you have finished typing one entry, press the return key and the next cell will automatically become active. Hence, it's easy to quickly type several entries. You can customize this behavior by selecting Settings Configure & kwordquiz;.... When you reach the bottom row of the grid, a new row will be added as you press return, so you can just continue to type. When a new window is created it has 20 rows, but there is really no limit to the number of rows you can have in a document.

Fill-in-the-blank
'Fill-in-the-blank 'is a powerful way to practice in & kwordquiz;. It is a special kind of question and answer quiz that needs to be described in more detail. In order to use this feature you must turn it on in the configuration dialog.
Consider the following table. It could be a vocabulary in & kwordquiz;:
English
German
1
We own a computer
Wir besitzen einen Computer
2
Wir [besitzen] einen Computer
3
Wir [besitzen einen] Computer
4
Wir [besitzen] einen [Computer]
The important thing to note is the placement of the brackets. They tell & kwordquiz; how the quiz should be performed.
In 1. there are no brackets. Assuming English is the question and German the answer you have to give the entire expression'Wir besitzen einen Computer 'for a correct answer.
In 2. & kwordquiz; would display the question but also'Wir........ einen Computer '. For a correct answer it is sufficient to write'besitzen'.
3. shows that a blank can consist of more than one word. The correct answer is'besitzen einen '.
In 4. there are two separate blanks. To specify that in the answer you have to write'besitzen; Computer ', i. e separate the blanks with a semicolon in order to get a correct answer.
Marked blanks are only of relevance if they appear in the answer. Otherwise the brackets are ignored. Furthermore, brackets have no effect in multiple choice quizzes. To simplify the creation of'Fill-in-the-blank 'vocabularies there are menu commands to mark and unmark blanks. Of course you can also just type the brackets. & kwordquiz; checks the syntax. If the text appears in red there is something wrong with the brackets and a quiz cannot be started.
The'Fill-in-the-blank 'features can be turned on and off in the Configuration dialog. Turning them of will make it possible to use fonts that map other characters to the positions of the brackets. It will also speed up performance slightly.
Printing
& kwordquiz; provides the ability to print vocabulary documents in several different ways. When selecting File Print... you are presented with the standard & kde; print dialog. In order to get access to the special & kwordquiz; features you need to click on the Optionsgt; gt; to see the Vocabulary Options tab.
