(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns the string "msec sec" where sec is the current time measured in the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (0:00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT), and msec is the microseconds part.
This function is only available on operating systems that support the gettimeofday() system call.
Both portions of the string are returned in units of seconds.
Example 1. microtime() example
function getmicrotime() {list($usec, $sec) = explode( "",microtime()); return ((float)$usec + (float)$sec);} $time_start = getmicrotime(); for ($i=0; $i 1000; $i++) {/ /do nothing, 1000 times} $time_end = getmicrotime(); $time = $time_end - $time_start; echo "Did nothing in $time seconds";
