Introduction
Gametype:
Arcade, Sport
Number of possible players:
Ten
& kappname; is a miniature golf game with 2d top-down view. Courses are dynamic, and up to 10 people can play at once in competition.
& kappname; comes with a tutorial course. Playing this course is the easiest way to get started.
How to Play
Objective:
Put the ball into the hole with the least possible hits.
& kappname; 's game-play is simple. It is the easiest to learn how to play hands-on, and thus a tutorial course is included to guide you through the basics. This chapter will guide you through this tutorial. To start the tutorial, choose Help Tutorial.
Hitting the Ball
To aim the ball, either line up the mouse behind the ball so the putter aims in the direction you want to hit it or press one of the Left Arrow (counterclockwise) or Right Arrow (clockwise) keys, to rotate the putter.
To rotate the putter more quickly with the keyboard, hold down & Shift; while pressing or holding the arrow keys. To rotate more slowly, hold down & Ctrl;.
To hit the ball, press and hold either the & LMB; or Down Arrow key. The longer you hold down the key or button, the more strength the putt will have. It will take practice to get a good feel for speed.
To stop the putt while you are still holding moving the putter back in your stroke, press Esc;.
Hit the ball into the hole to move on to the next.
Slopes
Slopes are slanted areas of the course that the golf ball rolls down in an expected manner. The light of the golf course is from the upper-left, so the brightest slopes will push the ball towards the upper-left corner of the hole. Choose Hole Show Info to see an arrow that points in the direction the slope will roll the ball.
On this tutorial hole, hit the ball onto the upward-pointing slope and let it roll into the cup to move onto the next hole.
Directions
On the next hole, experiment with the other kinds of slopes. There are elliptical, vertical, horizontal, and diagonal slopes in & kappname;. Hit the ball into the hole.
Steepness
The next tutorial hole has two slopes of differing steepness. If you choose Hole Show Info, the steepness of the slope will appear as a number from 1-8, where 8 is steepest and 1 is shallowest. Hit the ball into the hole and continue to the next hole.
Walls
Balls bounce of walls as one would expect them to, with a little bit of dampening. Deflect the ball off the walls and into the cup to advance to the next hole.
Puddles and Sand
Puddles
Puddles are blue. When your ball rolls into a puddle, a penalty stroke is added to your score and you must then choose where you want to take your next shot from: either next to the puddle or from the same place as where you just took the last shot.
Sand
Sand is yellow. Balls roll through sand very slowly.
Hit the ball around the puddles and through the sand into the hole to continue to the next tutorial hole.
Windmills
Windmills are compound objects with brown border walls and a moving arm on one side. Half-walls create the opening to the windmill, which the black arm swings across. It takes practice to be able to time the stroke of the ball to pass through the opening. Hit the ball through the windmill into the hole to continue.
Black Holes
When you hit your ball into a black hole, it is transported to the exit and ejected at the angle of the exit at a speed directly relational to the speed your ball was going. Choose Hole Show Info to see which Black Hole goes to which exit and which direction the ball will come out of the exit. The rim around Black Holes are the same color as their corresponding exits. Hit the ball into the black hole, which will then eject the ball into the cup so you can go to the next hole.
Floaters
Floaters are moving platforms that carry a ball that lands on it. Floaters' speeds vary. This one is a pretty slow floater, but you still must time your shot so you can go over the wall and into the cup.
Bridges
Bridges are simple - they just lift the ball above the things below them, like slopes, sand, and puddles. They can have brown walls on their perimeter.
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
Here's in-depth description of & kappname; 's basic features.
Starting a Game
To start a game, choose Game New. This opens a dialog where you can configure your new game.
More third-party & kappname; courses are available at the & kappname; website. See the & kappname; user-uploaded courses page.
Players Page
To add a player to your game, click the New Player button.
The text boxes in the grass area are the names of the players in this game. To change the name of the players, change the text in the text boxes. To change the ball color of the players' balls, click the middle button that has a color rectangle, and a dialog will open where you can select the new ball color. The rectangle on the button is the current player's ball color.
To remove a player, click the Remove button next to the player's name.
Course Page
To choose the course that you want to play, click its entry in the list box on the left of this page. & kappname; comes with many built-in courses that you can play.
To add a course that you have downloaded or made, click on the Add... button on the bottom of this page, and choose the course file in the file dialog.
Options Page
On this page you can choose whether or not this game will be played in Strict mode. In strict mode, there is no undo, moving holes, or editing of the course. This mode is generally for competition. Only in strict mode are high scores kept.
Saved Games
& kappname; can keep a history of your rounds that are still in progress and save them to disk so you can load them and play them later. Saved games include the current hole, names and colors of all players in game, and the scores of the players.
Saving Your Game
To save your game while still playing, choose Game Save Game. If you have not saved a game on this game before, you will be prompted for the file to save to.
Loading Your Game
To load the game that you saved, choose Game Load.... You can then choose the saved game to open.
Practicing
There are a few features that make practicing your golf easier. These features are not enabled during strict mode.
Undo
To undo a bad shot, choose Hole Undo Shot.
Switching Holes
The Go menu contains many menu items for switching to different holes that are quite self explanatory. See the Go menu reference.
Putting Options
& kappname; has a few ways to putt. The basic putting method is described above.
The mouse is enabled by default. This means that whenever the mouse is moved, the putter aligns to the line between the mouse and ball.
If you prefer to only use the keyboard and arrow keys, you can disable mouse putting by unchecking Settings Enable Mouse for Moving Putter.
Advanced Putting
Advanced putting can be enabled by checking Settings Enable Advanced Putting. This putting mode is slightly more challenging than the regular click-and-hold mode, and can be used with either the mouse or keyboard.
To putt in this mode:
Click or press the Down Arrow key once to begin the swing. The putting indicator will appear, and the strength gauge will start filling up with a color, which changes as the gauge fills up.
Click or press the Down Arrow key when the strength gauge has filled up the amount that you want. The farther around the circle the strength gauge has filled up, the stronger the putt will be. It takes practice to be able to get the correct strength on putts.
After this, the color in the putting indicator will start to wind down back to where it started.
Click or press the Down Arrow key again when the strength-indicator is as close as possible to the center line of the putting indicator.
The closer the final click (or key press) is, the more true the putt is to the original line.

Frequently asked questions
I want to change the way this game looks. Can I?
No. At this moment & kappname; features only one theme.
Can I use the keyboard to play the game?
Yes. Use the directional keys to control the putter.
I cannot figure out what to do here! Are there hints?
No. & kappname; does not have a hint feature.
I want to design my own golf course. Can I?
Yes, you can. To enter the edit mode use Ctrl; E Hole Edit on the menubar. Click here for more details.
Course Editor
& kappname; comes with a versatile editor for its course file format. Courses can have any number of holes, and there is no limiting the creativity of the course designer.
Creating a New Course
To create a new course, choose Game New. Go to the Course page of the dialog, and choose the Create New course. Make sure that, under the Options page of the dialog, Strict mode is unchecked.

Adding Holes
Choose Hole New to add a new hole at the end of the course.
You can restore a hole to a blank state, similar to when it was first created, by choosing Hole Clear.
Two items will appear on new holes: a cup, and a white ball. The white ball marks where players' balls start the hole.
Editing Basics
The basic building block of & kappname; courses is the object. Holes are made up of a bunch of objects. Objects can be moved to any location, and the different kinds of objects each have different properties you can set.
To start editing a hole, toggle the Hole Edit menu item, or press the pencil icon on the toolbar. To leave editing mode, uncheck this menu item (or the toolbar icon).
Adding Objects
To add a new object to the course, choose its name in the list box labeled Add object:. The object will appear in the center of the course.
Bridges and signs will cover up new objects if they were already in the center of the hole.
You can add more than one cup to a hole! Doing so can create interesting hole designs.
Some & kappname; objects are available as plugins. If you add these objects to your course, course players will need to download the plugin.
Third-party & kappname; plugins are available at the & kappname; website. See the & kappname; plugins download page.
Moving and Resizing Objects
Move your mouse cursor over the object that you want to move, and the mouse cursor will change to a hand cursor. Then click and drag the object to where you want it.
Puddles, sand, floaters, bridges, and signs can be resized by dragging the small circle at their lower-right corner.
Walls can be moved by clicking and dragging their endpoints, or you can move the whole wall by clicking and dragging on the middle part of the wall as normal.
Objects' Settings
Objects' properties can be changed in the area at the lower-right corner of the & kappname; window. To edit an object, move your mouse cursor over it until the cursor changes to the hand cursor. Then click. Various controls for that object will appear in the lower-right corner of the & kappname; window.
General Hole Settings
To edit general hole settings, click an area of the hole that is not covered by an object. When this is possible, the cursor will be the normal pointer cursor.
Course name:
This is the name that is shown in the new game dialog and in the About Course dialog.
Course author:
This is the author name that is shown in the About Course dialog.
Par:
The par of the hole.
Maximum:
The maximum number of strokes a player can take on the hole.
Show border walls
Whether or not to show walls around the border of the hole.
Type
Choose the type of the slope - Vertical, Horizontal, Diagonal, Opposite Diagonal, Circular. Diagonal and opposite diagonal slopes are triangles, while circular slopes are circles. Vertical and horizontal slopes are rectangles of course.
Reverse direction
Whether or not to reverse the slant of the slope. For example, consider an elliptical slope (a circular slope). When it is not reversed, it pushes balls outward like a mound. When it is reversed, it sucks balls inward like a hole.
Grade:
Choose the grade (steepness) of the slope by moving the slider so the grade moves towards 0 or 8, where 8 is steepest and 0 is flat. Steeper slopes push the ball more.
Unmovable
Whether or not this can be moved by other objects, like floaters.
If a floater overlaps with this object at any point on this path, and the slope is large and thus wo n't move the floater, you must make the slope Unmovable, or & kappname; will suffer poor performance!
Puddles and Sand have the same configuration options as each other.
Enable show/ hide
Checking this enables the flashing of this puddle or sand.
Show/ Hide speed
The more towards Fast the slider is, the faster the puddle or sand flashes.
Bridges, Windmills, Floaters, and Signs
Bridges, windmills, floaters, and signs all have similar settings for configuring on which sides there are border walls. To show the wall on a side, check the check box for that side.
There are also some more specific options for windmills, floaters, and signs.
Windmill on bottom
Whether or not the black windmill arm is on bottom or top - the default is that it is on the bottom. The two half-walls will always be with the arm. Note that you cannot enable a border wall on the side that the arm is.
Speed
The more towards Fast the slider is, the faster the black windmill arm moves.
The path the floater moves along is shown by the wall it's connected to.
Moving speed
The more towards Fast the slider is, the faster the floater moves. If the slider is all the way at the Slow end, the floater will stop.
Signs
Sign HTML:
You can enter any valid & HTML; here. For example, entering Hit it & lt; igt; softlylt; /igt; towards the slope! will create the text Hit it softly towards the slope!.
