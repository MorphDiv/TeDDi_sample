Options
Use this dialogue box to define some options that are available for specific chart types.
The contents of the Options dialogue box vary with the chart type.
Align data series to:
In this area you can choose between two y-axis scaling modes.
The axes can only be scaled and given properties separately.
Primary y-axis
This option is active as default.
All data series are aligned to the primary y-axis.
Secondary y-axis
Changes the scaling of the y-axis.
This axis is only visible when at least one data series is assigned to it and the axis view is active.
Settings
Define the settings for a bar chart in this area.
Any changes apply to all data series of the chart, not to the selected data only.
Spacing
Defines the spacing between the columns in percent.
The maximum spacing is 600%.
Overlap
Defines the necessary settings for overlapping data series.
You can choose between -100 and +100%.
Connection Lines
For &quot; stacked &quot; and &quot; percent &quot; column (vertical bar) charts, mark this check box to connect the column layers that belong together with lines.
Show bars side by side
If two axes are shown in a bar chart, and some data series are attached to the first axis, while some other data series are attached to the second axis, then both sets of data series are shown independently, overlapping each other.
The bars from different data series are shown as if they were attached only to one axis.
Clockwise direction
Clockwise direction
check box to draw the pieces in the opposite direction.
Starting angle
Drag the small dot along the circle or click any position on the circle to set the starting angle of a pie or doughnut chart.
The starting angle is the mathematical angle position where the first piece is drawn.
The value of 90 degrees draws the first piece at the 12 o'clock position.
A value of 0 degrees starts at the 3 o'clock position.
In 3-D pie and doughnut charts that were created with older versions of the software, the starting angle is 0 degrees instead of 90 degrees.
For old and new 2-D charts the default starting angle is 90 degrees.
When you change the starting angle or the direction, only current versions of the software show the changed values.
Older versions of the software display the same document using the default values:
Always counterclockwise direction and a starting value of 90 degrees (2-D pie charts) or 0 degrees (3-D pie charts).
Degrees
Enter the starting angle between 0 and 359 degrees.
You can also click the arrows to change the displayed value.
Plot missing values
Sometimes values are missing in a data series that is shown in a chart.
You can select from different options how to plot the missing values.
The options are available for some chart types only.
Leave gap
For a missing value, no data will be shown.
This is the default for chart types Column, Bar, Line, Net.
Assume zero
For a missing value, the y-value will be shown as zero.
This is the default for chart type Area.
Continue line
For a missing value, the interpolation from the neighbour values will be shown.
This is the default for chart type X-Y.
Include values from hidden cells
Mark to also show values of currently hidden cells within the source cell range.
