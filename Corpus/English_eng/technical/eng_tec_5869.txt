Introduction
& choqok; is a micro-blogging client which currently supports Identi. ca/ Laconica and Twitter. com services.
Micro-blogging is a form of multimedia blogging that allows users to send brief text updates or micro media such as photos or audio clips and publish them. These can be viewed either by anyone or by a restricted group, which can be decided by the user. These messages can be submitted by a variety of means, including text messaging, instant messaging, email, digital audio or the web.
Using & choqok;
Getting Started
In the & choqok; main window there are some timelines allowing you to see what your friends have posted, replies to them and direct messages sent and received from friends. You can also post a new message.
All of this will be available when you configure at least one account in & choqok;.
Here's a screenshot of the & choqok; main window
& choqok; main window
You have one tab per account, on the screenshot you can see a tab with the alias identica and another with the alias twitter.
On top of the tab you can choose to send a direct message to someone who is subscribed to your account. You can send direct messages to other users of the same service, as long as both of you are subscribed to each other. If you leave Direct message to unchecked your message will be posted publicly and all your friends will read it. If you check it, you will then choose a name in the list and the private message will only be posted to this person.
The text area allows you to post your message which must have less than 140 characters. The number of characters left is displayed in green on bottom right under the text area. The color changes to orange when you reach the 30 characters limit then to red when you reach 0. If your message is longer than 140 characters, you'll be asked if you want to post it anyway. If you agree, it'll be posted up to 140 characters.
The Home tab displays the timeline which consists in all posts you and your friends wrote. A post using Identi. ca is called a dent while a post using Twitter is called a tweet.
The Reply tab displays posts that are replies to you.
All the private messages you sent will be displayed in the Outbox tab while the received ones will be displayed in the Inbox tab.
Searching
You can search through services for something (anything that the service-search api can offer to a client).
This function is available via the File Search menu (shortcut: Ctrl; F) For example you can search for a special word in all users' posts:

Simply enter your desired unique alias, username and password and click the OK button. This will check your credentials and, if everything is okay, your account will be ready to use.
You can configure other accounts subsequently.
Special Features
You can disable the timeline updating of & choqok; (the timeline is the list of posts by you and your friends).
Another special feature is the ability to notify the user about new received posts.
