Run SQL command directly
In Native SQL mode you can enter SQL commands that are not interpreted by $[officename], but are instead passed directly to the data source.
If you do not display these changes in the design view, you cannot change back to the design view.
For native SQL, the SQL string is forwarded directly to the connected database system without a previous evaluation by $[officename].
For example, if you access a database through an ODBC interface, the SQL string is passed to the ODBC driver and processed by it.
