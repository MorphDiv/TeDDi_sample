CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium.
For the peadiatric population: sugammadex is only recommended for routine reversal of rocuronium induced blockade in children and adolescents.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Sugammadex should only be administered by, or under the supervision of an anaesthetist.
The use of an appropriate neuromuscular monitoring technique is recommended to monitor the recovery of neuromuscular blockade.
As is normal post-anesthetic practice following neuromuscular blockade it is recommended to monitor the patient in the immediate post-operative period for untoward events including re-occurrence of blockade (see section 4.4).
When certain medicinal products that may cause displacement interactions are administered parenterally within a period of 6 hours of sugammadex, the patient should be monitored for signs of re-occurrence of blockade (see section 4.4 and 4.5).
The recommended dose of sugammadex depends on the level of neuromuscular blockade to be reversed.
The recommended dose does not depend on the anaesthetic regimen.
Sugammadex can be used to reverse different levels of rocuronium or vecuronium induced neuromuscular blockade:
Adults
Routine reversal:
A dose of 4 mg/ kg sugammadex is recommended if recovery has reached at least 1-2 post-tetanic counts (PTC) following rocuronium or vecuronium induced blockade.
Median time to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 is around 3 minutes (see section 5.1).
A dose of 2 mg/ kg sugammadex is recommended, if spontaneous recovery has occurred up to at least the reappearance of T2 following rocuronium or vecuronium induced blockade.
Median time to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 is around 2 minutes (see section 5.1).
2 Using the recommended doses for routine reversal will result in a slightly faster median time to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 of rocuronium when compared to vecuronium induced neuromuscular blockade (see section 5.1).
Immediate reversal of rocuronium-induced blockade:
If there is a clinical need for immediate reversal following administration of rocuronium a dose of 16 mg/ kg sugammadex is recommended.
When 16 mg/ kg sugammadex is administered 3 minutes after a bolus dose of 1.2 mg/ kg rocuronium bromide, a median time to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 of approximately 1.5 minutes can be expected (see section 5.1).
There is no data to recommend the use of sugammadex for immediate reversal following vecuronium induced blockade.
Re-administration of sugammadex:
In the exceptional situation of re-occurrence of blockade post-operatively (see section 4.4) after an initial dose of 2 mg/ kg or 4 mg/ kg sugammadex, a repeat dose of 4 mg/ kg sugammadex is recommended.
Following a second dose of sugammadex, the patient should be closely monitored to ascertain sustained return of neuromuscular function.
Re-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium after sugammadex:
A waiting time of 24 hours should be taken into account (see section 4.4).
Additional information on special population
Renal impairment:
For mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 and < 80 ml/ min): the dose recommendations are the same as for adults.
The use of sugammadex in patients with severe renal impairment (including patients requiring dialysis (CrCl < 30 ml/ min)) is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Elderly patients:
After administration of sugammadex at reappearance of T2 following a rocuronium induced blockade, the median time to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 in adults (18-64 years) was 2.2 minutes, in elderly adults (65-74 years) it was 2.6 minutes and in very elderly adults (75 years or more) it was 3.6 minutes.
Even though the recovery times in elderly tend to be slower, the same dose recommendation as for adults should be followed (see section 4.4).
Obese patients:
In obese patients, the dose of sugammadex should be based on actual body weight.
The same dose recommendations as for adults should be followed.
Hepatic impairment:
For mild to moderate hepatic impairment: as sugammadex is mainly excreted renally no dose adjustments are required.
Studies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted and therefore patients with severe hepatic impairment should be treated with great caution (see section 4.4).
Paediatric population:
The data for the paediatric population are limited (one study only for reversal of rocuronium induced blockade at reappearance of T2).
Children and adolescents:
For routine reversal of rocuronium induced blockade at reappearance of T2 in children and adolescents (2-17 years) 2 mg/ kg sugammadex is recommended.
Other routine reversal situations have not been investigated and are therefore not recommended until further data become available.
Immediate reversal in children and adolescents has not been investigated and is therefore not recommended until further data become available.
3 Bridion 100 mg/ ml may be diluted to 10 mg/ ml to increase the accuracy of dosing in the paediatric population (see section 6.6).
Term newborn infants and infants:
There is only limited experience with the use of sugammadex in infants (30 days to 2 years), and term newborn infants (less than 30 days) have not been studied.
The use of sugammadex in term newborn infants and infants is therefore not recommended until further data become available.
Method of administration
Sugammadex should be administered intravenously as a single bolus injection.
The bolus injection should be given rapidly, within 10 seconds directly into a vein or into an existing intravenous line (see section 6.6).
Sugammadex has only been administered as a single bolus injection in clinical trials.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Monitoring respiratory function during recovery:
Ventilatory support is mandatory for patients until adequate spontaneous respiration is restored following reversal of neuromuscular block.
Even if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is complete, other medicinal products used in the peri- and postoperative period could depress respiratory function and therefore ventilatory support might still be required.
Should neuromuscular blockade reoccur following extubation, adequate ventilation should be provided.
Re-occurrence of blockade:
In clinical trials re-occurrence of blockade was reported mainly when sub-optimal doses (in dose finding studies) were administered.
In order to prevent re-occurrence of neuromuscular blockade, the recommended doses for routine or immediate reversal (see section 4.2) should be used.
Waiting times for re-administration with neuromuscular blocking agents after reversal with sugammadex:
If re-administration of rocuronium or vecuronium is required a waiting time of 24 hours is recommended.
If neuromuscular blockade is required before the recommended waiting time has passed, a nonsteroidal neuromuscular blocking agent should be used.
Renal impairment:
In patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min) the excretion of sugammadex or the sugammadex-rocuronium complex was delayed, however in these patients there were no signs of re-occurrence of neuromuscular blockade.
Data from a limited number of renally impaired patients requiring dialysis indicate an inconsistent decrease of plasma levels of sugammadex by haemodialysis.
The use of sugammadex in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended.
Interactions due to the lasting effect of rocuronium or vecuronium:
When medicinal products which potentiate neuromuscular blockade are used in the post-operative period special attention should be paid to the possibility of re-occurrence of blockade.
Please refer to the package leaflet of rocuronium or vecuronium for a list of the specific medicinal products which potentiate neuromuscular blockade.
In case re-occurrence of blockade is observed, the patient may require mechanical ventilation and re-administration of sugammadex (see section 4.2).
Potential interactions: • Capturing interactions:
4 Due to the administration of sugammadex, certain medicinal products could become less effective due to a lowering of the (free) plasma concentrations (see section 4.5, hormonal contraceptives).
If such a situation is observed, the clinician is advised to consider the re-administration of the medicinal product, the administration of a therapeutically equivalent medicinal product (preferably from a different chemical class) and/ or non-pharmacological interventions as appropriate. • Displacement interactions:
Due to the administration of certain medicinal products after sugammadex, theoretically rocuronium or vecuronium could be displaced from sugammadex.
As a result re-occurrence of blockade might be observed.
In this situation the patient must be ventilated.
Administration of the medicinal product which caused displacement should be stopped in case of an infusion.
In situations when potential displacement interactions can be anticipated, patients should be carefully monitored for signs of re-occurrence of blockade (approximately up to 15 minutes) after parenteral administration of another medicinal product occurring within a period of 6 hours after sugammadex administration.
Displacement interactions are at present only expected for a few drugs substances (toremifene, flucloxacillin and fusidic acid, see section 4.5).
Light anaesthesia:
When neuromuscular blockade was reversed intentionally in the middle of anaesthesia in clinical trials, signs of light anaesthesia were noted occasionally (movement, coughing, grimacing and suckling of the tracheal tube).
If neuromuscular blockade is reversed, while anaesthesia is continued, additional doses of anaesthetic and/ or opioid should be given as clinically indicated.
Hepatic impairment:
Sugammadex is not metabolised nor excreted by the liver; therefore dedicated studies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should be treated with great caution.
Use in Intensive Care Unit (ICU):
Sugammadex has not been investigated in patients receiving rocuronium or vecuronium in the ICU setting.
Use for reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents other than rocuronium or vecuronium:
Sugammadex should not be used to reverse block induced by nonsteroidal neuromuscular blocking agents such as succinylcholine or benzylisoquinolinium compounds.
Sugammadex should not be used for reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents other than rocuronium or vecuronium, since there are no efficacy and safety data for these situations.
Limited data are available for reversal of pancuronium induced blockade, but it is advised not to use sugammadex in this situation.
Delayed recovery:
Conditions associated with prolonged circulation time such as cardiovascular disease, old age (see section 4.2 for the time to recovery in elderly), or oedematous state may be associated with longer recovery times.
Allergic reactions:
Clinicians should be prepared for the possibility of allergic reactions and take the necessary precautions (see section 4.8).
Patients on a controlled sodium diet:
Each ml solution contains 9.7 mg sodium.
A dose of 23 mg sodium is considered essentially ‘ sodium- free’.
If more than 2.4 ml solution needs to be administered, this should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.
QTc-interval prolongation:
5 Two thorough QTc trials (N=146), both in conscious volunteers, demonstrated that sugammadex alone or in combination with rocuronium or vecuronium is not associated with QTc interval prolongation. The one-sided 95% upper confidence limits for the QTc difference to placebo were well below the 10 ms margin for each of the 12-13 evaluated timepoints in both studies.
In the clinical program, a few cases of QTc prolongation were reported (QTc > 500 msec or QTc increases > 60 msec) in clinical trials in which patients received sugammadex in combination with sevoflurane or propofol.
During anaesthesia several medicinal products with the potential to prolong QTc (e. g. sevoflurane) are administered.
The routine precautions for treating arrhythmia should be taken into consideration.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been conducted in adults with sugammadex and other medicinal products.
The information in this section is based on binding affinity between sugammadex and other medicinal products, non-clinical experiments and simulations using a model taking into account the pharmacodynamic effect of neuromuscular blocking agents and the pharmacokinetic interaction between neuromuscular blocking agents and sugammadex.
Based on in-vitro data and taking into consideration pharmacokinetics and other relevant information, no clinically significant pharmacodynamic interaction with other medicinal products is expected, with exception of the following:
For toremifene, flucloxacillin and fusidic acid displacement interactions could not be excluded (no clinically relevant capturing interactions are expected).
For hormonal contraceptives a clinically relevant capturing interaction could not be excluded (no displacement interactions are expected).
Interactions potentially affecting the efficacy of sugammadex (see also section 4.4):
Toremifene:
For toremifene, which has a relatively high affinity constant and relatively high plasma concentrations, some displacement of vecuronium or rocuronium from the complex with sugammadex could occur.
The recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 could therefore be delayed in patients who have received toremifene on the same day of the operation.
Intravenous administration of flucloxacillin and fusidic acid:
Intravenous administration of fusidic acid and high dose flucloxacillin (infusion of 500 mg or more), may cause some displacement of rocuronium or vecuronium from sugammadex.
The use of these medicinal products in the pre-operative phase may give some delay in the recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9.
The use of these medicinal products in the post-operative phase after routine reversal during the surveillance period of 6 hours (see section 4.4) should be avoided.
If administration of flucloxacillin or fusidic acid within this time period can not be avoided, ventilation should be closely observed, in particular during the first 15 minutes after dosing.
For re-administration of sugammadex see section 4.2.
Interactions potentially affecting the efficacy of other medicinal products (see also section 4.4):
Hormonal contraceptives:
The interaction between 4 mg/ kg sugammadex and a progestogen was predicted to lead to a decrease in progestogen exposure (34% of AUC) similar to the decrease seen when a missed daily dose of an oral contraceptive is taken 12 hours too late, which might lead to a reduction in effectiveness.
For estrogens, the effect is expected to be lower.
Therefore the administration of a bolus dose of sugammadex is considered to be equivalent to one missed daily dose of oral contraceptive steroids (either combined or progestogen only).
If sugammadex is administered at the same day as an oral contraceptive is taken reference is made to missed dose advice in the package leaflet of the oral contraceptive.
In the case of non-oral hormonal contraceptives, the patient must use an additional non hormonal contraceptive method for the next 7 days and refer to the advice in the package leaflet of the product.
Interference with laboratory tests:
6 In general sugammadex does not interfere with laboratory tests, with the possible exception of the serum progesterone assay and some coagulation parameters (activated partial thromboplastin time prothrombin time, prothrombin time (international normalized ratio)).
This interference was observed in plasma samples spiked with a concentration of sugammadex in the same range as obtained for Cmax after a dose of 16 mg/ kg.
The clinical relevance of these findings is uncertain as this has not been studied in patients.
Paediatric population
No formal interaction studies have been performed.
The above mentioned interactions for adults and the warnings in section 4.4 should also be taken into account for the paediatric population.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
For sugammadex no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development.
Caution should be exercised when administering sugammadex to pregnant women.
It is unknown whether sugammadex is excreted in human breast milk.
Animal studies have shown excretion of sugammadex in breast milk.
Oral absorption of cyclodextrins in general is low and no effects on the suckling child is anticipated following a single dose to the breast-feeding woman.
Sugammadex can be used during breast-feeding.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The safety of sugammadex has been evaluated based on an integrated safety database of approximately 1700 patients and 120 volunteers.
The most commonly reported adverse reaction dysgeusia (metal or bitter taste) was mainly seen after doses of 32 mg/ kg sugammadex or higher.
In a few individuals allergic-like reactions (i. e. flushing, erythematous rash) following sugammadex were reported of which one was a confirmed mild allergic reaction.

Dysgeusia
Anaesthetic complication:
Anaesthetic complications, indicative of the restoration of neuromuscular function, include movement of a limb or the body or coughing during the anaesthetic procedure or during surgery, grimacing, or suckling on the endotracheal tube.
See section 4.4 light anaesthesia.
Awareness:
In sugammadex treated subjects a few cases of awareness were reported.
The relation to sugammadex is uncertain.
Re-occurrence of blockade:
7 In the data-base of pooled phase I-III studies with a placebo group, the incidence of re-occurrence of blockade as measured with neuromuscular monitoring was 2% after sugammadex and 0% in the placebo group.
Virtually all of these cases were from dose-finding studies in which a sub-optimal dose (less than 2 mg/ kg) was administered (see section 4.4).
Additional information on special populations
Pulmonary patients:
In one clinical trial in patients with a history of pulmonary complications bronchospasm was reported as a possibly related adverse event in two patients and a causal relationship could not be fully excluded.
As with all patients with a history of pulmonary complications the physician should be aware of the possible occurrence of bronchospasm.
Paediatric population
A limited database suggests that the safety profile of sugammadex (up to 4 mg/ kg) in paediatric patients was similar to that in adults.
4.9 Overdose
In clinical studies, 1 case of an accidental overdose with 40 mg/ kg was reported without any significant undesirable effects.
In a human tolerance study sugammadex was administered in doses up to 96 mg/ kg.
No dose related adverse events nor serious adverse events were reported.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: all other therapeutic products, ATC code:
V03AB35
Mechanism of action:
Sugammadex is a modified gamma cyclodextrin which is a Selective Relaxant Binding Agent.
It forms a complex with the neuromuscular blocking agents rocuronium or vecuronium in plasma and thereby reduces the amount of neuromuscular blocking agent available to bind to nicotinic receptors in the neuromuscular junction.
This results in the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium.
Pharmacodynamic effects:
Sugammadex has been administered in doses ranging from 0.5 mg/ kg to 16 mg/ kg in dose response studies of rocuronium induced blockade (0.6, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.2 mg/ kg rocuronium bromide with and without maintenance doses) and vecuronium induced blockade (0.1 mg/ kg vecuronium bromide with or without maintenance doses) at different time points/ depths of blockade.
In these studies a clear dose-response relationship was observed.
Clinical efficacy and safety:
Sugammadex can be administered at several time points after administration of rocuronium or vecuronium bromide:
Routine reversal – deep neuromuscular blockade:
In a pivotal study patients were randomly assigned to the rocuronium or vecuronium group.
After the last dose of rocuronium or vecuronium, at 1-2 PTCs, 4 mg/ kg sugammadex or 70 mcg/ kg neostigmine was administered in a randomised order.
The time from start of administration of sugammadex or neostigmine to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 was:
Time (minutes) from administration of sugammadex or neostigmine at deep neuromuscular blockade (1-2 PTCs) after rocuronium or vecuronium to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9

36 49.9 46.0-312.7
Routine reversal – moderate neuromuscular blockade:
In another pivotal study patients were randomly assigned to the rocuronium or vecuronium group.
After the last dose of rocuronium or vecuronium, at the reappearance of T2, 2 mg/ kg sugammadex or 50 mcg/ kg neostigmine was administered in a randomised order.
The time from start of administration of sugammadex or neostigmine to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 was:
Time (minutes) from administration of sugammadex or neostigmine at reappearance of T2 after rocuronium or vecuronium to recovery of the T4/ T1 ratio to 0.9 Neuromuscular blocking agent Rocuronium

Reversal by sugammadex of the neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium was compared to the reversal by neostigmine of the neuromuscular blockade induced by cis-atracurium.
At the reappearance of T2 a dose of 2 mg/ kg sugammadex or 50 mcg/ kg neostigmine was administered.
Sugammadex provided faster reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium compared to neostigmine reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by cis-atracurium:

5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The sugammadex pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the total sum of non-complex- bound and complex-bound concentrations of sugammadex.
Pharmacokinetic parameters as clearance and volume of distribution are assumed to be the same for non-complex-bound and complex-bound sugammadex in anaesthetised subjects.
Distribution:
The steady-state volume of distribution of sugammadex is approximately 11 to 14 litres.
Neither sugammadex nor the complex of sugammadex and rocuronium bind to plasma proteins or erythrocytes, as was shown in vitro using male human plasma and whole blood.
Sugammadex exhibits linear kinetics in the dosage range of 1 to 16 mg/ kg when administered as an IV bolus dose.
Metabolism:
In preclinical and clinical studies no metabolites of sugammadex have been observed and only renal excretion of the unchanged product was observed as the route of elimination.
Elimination:
The elimination half-life (t½) of sugammadex in adults is 1.8 hours and plasma clearance is estimated to be 88 ml/ min.
A mass balance study demonstrated that > 90% of the dose was excreted within 24 hours.
96% of the dose was excreted in urine, of which at least 95% could be attributed to unchanged sugammadex.
Excretion via faeces or expired air was less than 0.02% of the dose.
Administration of sugammadex to healthy volunteers resulted in increased renal elimination of rocuronium in complex.
Special populations:
Elderly and renal impairment:
The pharmacokinetic parameters based on pharmacokinetic modelling in typical elderly and/ or renally impaired patients are presented below:
Typical subject (75 kg body weight) Adult Normal CrCL:

Paediatrics:
Pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients (n=51) with ages ranging from 0 to 17 years were evaluated using population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.
In patients under age 18, volume of distribution and clearance increase with increasing age.
Variability of plasma concentrations of sugammadex in paediatric patients is comparable to the variability in adult patients.
The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of two typical paediatric patients are summarised below:
PK Parameters of sugammadex in typical paediatric patients PK Parameter Elimination Half-Life (h) Volume of Distribution at Steady State (l)
Child (Age:8 yr) 0.9 3.1
Adolescent (Age:
15 yr) 1.7 9.1
Clearance (ml/ min)
41
71
Gender:
No gender differences were observed.
Race:
In a study in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed.
Limited data does not indicate differences in pharmacokinetic parameters in Black or African Americans.
Body weight:
Population pharmacokinetic analysis of adult and elderly patients showed no clinically relevant relationship of clearance and volume of distribution with body weight.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity potential, and toxicity to reproduction, local tolerance or compatibility with blood.
Sugammadex is rapidly cleared from most organs; however some retention of compound occurs in bone and teeth in the rat.
The most likely component involved in the reversible binding is hydroxy apatite, the inorganic matrix in these tissues.
Preclinical studies in young adult and mature rats have shown that this retention does not adversely affect tooth colour or bone quality, structure, turnover and development.
In juvenile rats whitish discoloration was observed in the incisors and disturbance of enamel formation was observed upon repeated dosing, however at exposure levels of 48-480 times the clinical exposure at 4 mg/ kg.

Sugammadex can be injected into the intravenous line of a running infusion with the following intravenous solutions: sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%), glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%), sodium chloride 4.5 mg/ ml (0.45%) and glucose 25 mg/ ml (2.5%), Ringers lactate solution, Ringers solution, glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) in sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%).
For paediatric patients Bridion can be diluted using sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) to a concentration of 10 mg/ ml (see section 6.3).
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

1.
WHAT BRIDION IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Bridion is one of a group of medicines called Selective Relaxant Binding Agents.
It is used to speed up the recovery of your muscles after an operation.
When you have some types of operation, your muscles must be completely relaxed.
This makes it easier for the surgeon to do the operation.
For this, the general anaesthetic you are given includes medicines to make your muscles relax.
These are called muscle relaxants, and examples include rocuronium bromide and vecuronium bromide.
Because these medicines also make your breathing muscles relax, you need help to breathe (artificial ventilation) during and after your operation until you can breathe on your own again.
Bridion is used to stop muscle relaxants working.
It does this by combining with the rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in your body.
Bridion is given to speed up your recovery from the muscle relaxant – for example, at the end of an operation to allow you to breathe normally earlier.
2.
BEFORE BRIDION IS GIVEN
You should not be given Bridion • if you are allergic (hypersensitve) to sugammadex or any of the other ingredients. → Tell your anaesthetist if this applies to you.
Take special care with Bridion • if you have kidney disease or had in the past.
This is important as Bridion is removed from your body by the kidneys. • if you have heart disease or have had it in the past. • if you have liver disease or have had it in the past. • if you have fluid retention (oedema). • if you are on a controlled salt diet. → Tell your anaesthetist if any of the above applies to you.
Taking other medicines → Please tell your anaesthetist if you are taking or have recently taken other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or herbal products.
Bridion may affect other medicines or be affected by them.
25 Some medicines reduce the effect of Bridion → It is especially important that you tell your anaesthetist if you have recently taken: • toremifene (used to treat breast cancer). • flucloxacillin (an antibiotic). • fusidic acid (an antibiotic).
Bridion can affect hormonal contraceptives • Bridion can make hormonal contraceptives - including the ‘ Pill’, vaginal ring, implants or a hormonal IntraUterine System (IUS) - less effective because it reduces how much you get of the progestogen hormone.
The amount of progestogen lost by using Bridion is about the same as missing one oral contraceptive Pill. → If you are taking the Pill on the same day as Bridion is given to you, follow the instructions for a missed dose in the Pill’ s package leaflet. → If you are using other hormonal contraceptives (for example a vaginal ring, implant or IUS) you should use an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method (such as a condom) for the next 7 days and follow the advice in the package leaflet.
Effects on blood tests In general, Bridion does not have an effect on laboratory tests.
However, it may affect the results of a blood test for a hormone called progesterone and some blood clotting tests.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding → Tell your anaesthetist if you are pregnant or might be pregnant.
You may still be given Bridion, but you need to discuss it first.
Sugammadex can be used during breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to drive or operate machinery after you have been given Bridion.
Bridion is not known to have an effect on alertness or concentration.
3.
HOW BRIDION IS GIVEN
The dose Your anaesthetist will work out the dose of Bridion you need based on: • your weight • how much the muscle relaxant medicine is still affecting you.
The usual dose is 2-4 mg per kg body weight.
A higher dose may be given if the anaesthetist wants you to recover faster.
The dose of Bridion for children is 2 mg/ kg (children and adolescents between 2-17 years old).
How Bridion is given Bridion will be given to you by your anaesthetist.
It is given into a vein (intravenously) as a single injection.
If more Bridion is given to you than recommended As your anaesthetist will be monitoring your condition carefully, it is unlikely that you will be given too much Bridion.
But even if this happens, it is unlikely to cause any problems.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicinal product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Bridion can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
26 If these side effects occur while you are under anaesthesic, they will be seen and treated by your anaesthetist.
Very common side effects (in more than 1 user in 10) • A temporary unpleasant taste in your mouth.
Common side effects (in 1 to 10 users in 100) • Light anaesthesia - you may start to come out of deep sleep, so need more anaesthetic.
This might cause you to move or cough at the end of the operation. • Your muscles may turn weak again after the operation (if a too low dose is administered).
Uncommon side effects (in 1 to 10 users in 1,000) • Being awake during the operation (anaesthesia awareness) • Shortness of breath due to muscle cramps of the airways (bronchospasm) occurred in patients with a history of asthma • Allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions - such as a rash or red skin.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
