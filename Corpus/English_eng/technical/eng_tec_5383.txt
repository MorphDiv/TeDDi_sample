These functions allow you to access Oracle8 and Oracle7 databases.
It uses the Oracle8 Call-Interface (OCI8)
This extension is more flexible than the standard Oracle extension.
It supports binding of global and local PHP variables to Oracle placeholders, has full LOB, FILE and ROWID support and allows you to use user-supplied define variables.
You will need the Oracle8 client libraries to use this extension.
Before using this extension, make sure that you have set up your Oracle environment variables properly for the Oracle user, as well as your web daemon user.
The variables you might need to set are as follows:
ORACLE_HOME
ORACLE_SID
LD_PRELOAD
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
NLS_LANG
ORA_NLS33
After setting up the environment variables for your webserver user, be sure to also add the webserver user (nobody, www) to the oracle group.
If your webserver doesn 't start or crashes at startup:
Check that Apache is linked with the pthread library:
# ldd / www / apache / bin / httpd libpthread.so.0 = / lib / libpthread.so.0 (0x4001c000) libm.so.6 = / lib / libm.so.6 (0x4002f000) libcrypt.so.1 = / lib / libcrypt.so.1 (0x4004c000) libdl.so.2 = / lib / libdl.so.2 (0x4007a000) libc.so.6 = / lib / libc.so.6 (0x4007e000) / lib / ld-linux.so.2 = / lib / ld-linux.so.2 (0x40000000)
If the libpthread is not listed you have to reinstall Apache:
# cd / usr / src / apache_1.3.xx # make clean # LIBS=-lpthread. / config.status # make # make install
Please note that on some systems like UnixWare it is libthread instead of libpthread.
PHP and Apache have to be configured with EXTRA_LIBS=-lthread.
You have to compile PHP with the option --with-oci8[ =DIR], where DIR defaults to your environmment variable ORACLE_HOME.
This extension has no configuration directives defined in php.ini.
The constants below are defined by this extension, and will only be available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.
Example 1.
OCI Hints
?php / / by sergo@bacup.ru / / Use option:
OCI_DEFAULT for execute command to delay execution OCIExecute( $stmt, OCI_DEFAULT); / / for retrieve data use (after fetch): $result = OCIResult($stmt, $n); if (is_object ($result)) $result = $result - load(); / / For INSERT or UPDATE statement use: $sql = "insert into table (field1, field2) values (field1 = 'value', field2 = empty_clob()) returning field2 into :field2"; OCIParse($conn, $sql); $clob = OCINewDescriptor($conn, OCI_D_LOB); OCIBindByName ($stmt, ":field2", $clob, -1, OCI_B_CLOB); OCIExecute($stmt, OCI_DEFAULT); $clob - save ("some text"); OCICommit($conn);?
You can easily access stored procedures in the same way as you would from the commands line.
Example 2.
Using Stored Procedures
?php / / by webmaster@remoterealty.com $sth = OCIParse ($dbh, "begin sp_newaddress (:address_id, '$firstname', '$lastname', '$company', '$address1', '$address2', '$city', '$state', '$postalcode', '$country', :error_code );end; "); / / This calls stored procedure sp_newaddress, with :address_id being an / / in / out variable and :error_code being an out variable. / / Then you do the binding:
OCIBindByName ($sth, ":address_id", $addr_id, 10); OCIBindByName ($sth, ":error_code", $errorcode, 10); OCIExecute ($sth);?
