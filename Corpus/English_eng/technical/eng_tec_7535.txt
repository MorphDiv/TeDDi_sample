*
CCID50 = the quantity of virus, which infects 50% of the cell cultures inoculated.

Thiomersal
0.15 mg
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for emulsion for injection
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Pigs
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
Active immunisation of pigs from the age of 10 weeks to prevent the mortality and clinical signs of Aujeszky’ s Disease and to reduce the excretion of Aujeszky’ s Disease field virus.
Passive immunisation of the progeny of vaccinated gilts and sows to reduce mortality and clinical signs of Aujeszky’ s Disease and to reduce the excretion of Aujeszky’ s Disease field virus.
- Active immunity:
The onset of immunity is from 3 weeks after basic vaccination.
The immunity lasts
for 3 months after basic vaccination.
4.3 Contraindications
None
4.4 Special warnings for each target species
None
2 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals Do not administer in conjunction with other medicinal products.
Vaccinate only healthy animals.
Each piglet of vaccinated gilts or sows should ingest a sufficient quantity of colostrum and milk.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals Wash and disinfect hands and equipment after use.
To the user:
This product contains mineral oil.
Accidental injection/ self injection may result in severe pain and swelling, particularly if injected into a joint or finger, and in rare cases could result in the loss of the affected finger if prompt medical attention is not given.
If you are accidentally injected with this product, seek prompt medical advice even if only a very small amount is injected and take the package insert with you.
If pain persists for more than 12 hours after medical examination, seek medical advice again.
To the physician:
This product contains mineral oil.
Even if small amounts have been injected, accidental injection with this product can cause intense swelling, which may, for example, result in ischaemic necrosis and even the loss of a digit.
Expert, PROMPT, surgical attention is required and may necessitate early incision and irrigation of the injected area, especially where there is involvement of finger pulp or tendon.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Slight, transient and local reactions up to 2 cm in diameter after first vaccination and up to 5 cm after second vaccination may occur up to 50% of the pigs.
In general these reactions disappear within 3 weeks post primary vaccination.
A transient increase in body temperature, up to about 40.5oC and lasting for up to 2 days, may occur in a small number of pigs after vaccination.
In very rare cases (< 1/ 100000), hypersensitivity can be observed.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Can be used during pregnancy and lactation.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No information is available on the compatibility of this vaccine with any other.
Therefore the safety and efficacy of this product when used with any other (either used on the same day or at different times) has not been demonstrated.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
For intramuscular use To reconstitute the vaccine, inject 3 ml of solvent into the small vial with the powder.
Shake gently to disolve the vaccine and transfer the disolved vaccine into the vial with the solvent.
To avoid foaming, shake gently the vial after reconstitution of the freeze-dried component in the liquid component.
Use sterile syringes and needles.
Administer by intramuscular injection of 1 dose (2 ml) per pig in the neck in the area behind the ear.
3 Basic vaccination of fattening pigs and breeding pigs (gilts, sows and boars): • Inject one dose per fattening pig from the age of 10 weeks.
A second dose may be injected 3 – 4 weeks after the first injection.
The presence of maternal antibodies against Aujeszky’ s Disease Virus may have a negative influence on the result of vaccination. • Inject one dose per breeding pigs (gilts, sows and boars) from the age of 10 weeks followed by a second injection 3 – 4 weeks after the first injection.
Re-vaccination of breeding pigs (gilts, sows and boars): • Inject one dose per gilt before the first mating, or • Inject one dose per gilt or sow during each gestation at 3 - 6 weeks before the expected date of farrowing. • Inject one dose per boar at least every 6 months.
For whole herd vaccination, an injection of one dose may be administered per gilt, sow and boar every 4 months.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Apart from an increase in the extent of the tissue reaction at the site of injection, no other undesirable effects have been observed.
4.11 Withdrawal period
Zero days
5.
IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
ATC vet code:
QI 09 AD 01
The active substance stimulates active immunity against Aujeszky’ s Disease in pigs.
By reconstitution of the immunogen in the oil emulsion, the stimulation of immunity after injection is prolonged.
Progeny of vaccinated gilts and sows derive a passive immunity via the colostrum and milk.
The gE- (glycoprotein E negative) characteristic of the vaccine virus makes it possible to distinguish between antibodies induced by vaccination with this product and those induced by field infection with Aujeszky’ s Disease Virus, if the vaccine is used in association with an appropriate diagnostic test.
Therefore, the product is suitable to be used in eradication programmes against Aujeszky’ s Disease field virus in pigs based on the presence or absence of antibodies against the gE-antigen of that virus.

OTHER INFORMATION
For animal treatment only.
The active substance stimulates active immunity against Aujeszky’ s Disease in pigs.
By reconstitution of the immunogen in the oil emulsion the stimulation of immunity after injection is prolonged.
Progeny of vaccinated gilts and sows derive a passive immunity via the colostrum and milk.
The presence of maternal antibodies against Aujeszky’ s Disease Virus may have a negative influence on the result of vaccination.
The gE- (glycoprotein E negative) characteristic of the vaccine virus makes it possible to distinguish between antibodies induced by vaccination with this product and those induced by field infection with Aujeszky’ s Disease Virus, if the vaccine is used in association with an appropriate diagnostic test.
Therefore, the product is suitable to be used in eradication programmes against Aujeszky’ s Disease field virus in pigs based on the presence or absence of antibodies against the gE-antigen of that virus.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
For any information about this veterinary medicinal product, please contact the local representative of the marketing authorisation holder.
