AND operator (logical)
AND Operator [Run-time]
Logically combines two expressions.
Syntax:
Result = Expression1 AND Expression2
Parameters:
Result:
A numerical variable that will contain the result of the combination.
Expression1, Expression2:
Boolean or numerical expressions that you want to combine.
True
if both expressions evaluate to
True
:
True
AND
True
returns
True
; for all other combinations the result is
False
.
The AND operator also performs a bitwise comparison of identically positioned bits in two numerical expressions.
Example:
Sub ExampleAnd
Dim A as Variant, B as Variant, C as Variant, D as Variant
Dim vVarOut as Variant
A = 10:
B = 8:
C = 6:
D = Null
vVarOut = A > B And B > C REM returns -1
vVarOut = B > A And B > C REM returns 0
vVarOut = A > B And B > D REM returns 0
vVarOut = (B > D And B > A) REM returns 0
vVarOut = B And A REM returns 8 due to the bitwise AND combination of both arguments
End Sub
