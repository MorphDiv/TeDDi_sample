Operators
Next
PHP supports one execution operator: backticks (``).
Note that these are not single-quotes!
PHP will attempt to execute the contents of the backticks as a shell command; the output will be returned (i.e., it won't simply be dumped to output; it can be assigned to a variable).
$output = `ls -al`; echo "pre $output / pre";
Note:
The backtick operator is disabled when safe mode is enabled or shell_exec() is disabled.
See also escapeshellcmd(), exec(), passthru(), popen(), shell_exec(), and system().
