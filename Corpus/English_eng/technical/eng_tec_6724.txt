Nibbles is a worm game for GNOME. The player controls a 2D worm while trying to get food. Getting food gives points, but hitting anything causes a loss of points. When all points are lost, the player loses.

Nibbles Objective
The objective of Nibbles is quite simple. You control the worm and if the worm runs into a wall or runs into itself, you die. You get ten lives before your game is over. You win by either beating your own high score (or a friend's) or by completing all the levels. It is also possible to play against worms with artificial intelligence.

Use relative motion
Rather than left sending your worm toward the left of the screen, right toward the right and so on, the left and right keys make the worm perform a left or right turn. For example, if the worm is moving to the left and you press the left control it turns to head toward the bottom of the screen.

Playing multiplayer Nibbles games
Multiplayer Nibbles games have pretty much the same rules as normal Nibbles games, except that you are now playing against human players. This means that other strategies might possibly be better than when playing against AI players.
Once a player has won, the game ends and you can return to the initial network game screen. Then you can play yet another game of addictive Nibbles multiplayer!
