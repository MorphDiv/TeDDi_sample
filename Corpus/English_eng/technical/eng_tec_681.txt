Special properties of a formatted field
Formatting:
You can set the
Formatting
property by clicking the
...
button in the
Formatting
line of the
Properties:
Formatted Field
dialogue box.
The
Number Format
dialogue box appears.
If the formatted field is connected to the text field of a database, the entries in this field will be treated as text.
If the formatted field is connected to a field of the database that can be displayed as a number, the input is treated as numbers.
The date and time are also handled internally as numbers.
Minimum value
and
Maximum value
:
You can enter the minimum and maximum numerical value for a formatted field.
The minimum and maximum values determine the output of existing data (Example:
Minimum value is 5, the connected database field contains the integer value 3.
The output is 5, but the value in the database is not modified) and the input of new data (Example:
Maximum value is 10 and you enter 20.
The input is corrected and 10 is written in the database).
If the fields are not filled in for
Minimum value
and
Maximum value
, no limits will be applied.
For formatted fields that are connected to a database text field, these two values and the
Default value
do not apply.
Default value:
This value is set for new records as the default value.
