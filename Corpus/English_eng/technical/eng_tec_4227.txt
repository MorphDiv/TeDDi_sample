(PHP 3 = 3.0.17, PHP 4)
Lists all tables in the requested range.
Returns an ODBC result identifier or FALSE on failure.
The result set has the following columns:
TABLE_QUALIFIER
TABLE_OWNER
TABLE_NAME
TABLE_TYPE
REMARKS
The result set is ordered by TABLE_TYPE, TABLE_QUALIFIER, TABLE_OWNER and TABLE_NAME.
The owner and name arguments accept search patterns ('% 'to match zero or more characters and '_' to match a single character).
To support enumeration of qualifiers, owners, and table types, the following special semantics for the qualifier, owner, name, and table_type are available:
If qualifier is a single percent character (%) and owner and name are empty strings, then the result set contains a list of valid qualifiers for the data source. (All columns except the TABLE_QUALIFIER column contain NULLs.)
If owner is a single percent character (%) and qualifier and name are empty strings, then the result set contains a list of valid owners for the data source. (All columns except the TABLE_OWNER column contain NULLs.)
If table_type is a single percent character (%) and qualifier, owner and name are empty strings, then the result set contains a list of valid table types for the data source. (All columns except the TABLE_TYPE column contain NULLs.)
If table_type is not an empty string, it must contain a list of comma-separated values for the types of interest; each value may be enclosed in single quotes (') or unquoted.
For example, "'TABLE' ,'VIEW'" or "TABLE, VIEW ".
If the data source does not support a specified table type, odbc_tables() does not return any results for that type.
See also odbc_tableprivileges() to retrieve associated privileges.
