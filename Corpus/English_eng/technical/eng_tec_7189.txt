Rounding Things Out
For 3.12 we have worked with our users to round out the GNOME 3 experience. An emphasis on filling in requested functionality has resulted in a number of changes, including the addition of wired networking to the system status area and the creation of user-configurable application folders. Many of the improvements to the software updates experience have also come about through dialog with users.
This release also includes many smaller changes that result in a much more polished, high-quality experience. Dialogs are now displayed in the

Popovers
GNOME 3.12 introduces a new interface element, called popovers. These overlaid bubbles are highly flexible and allow effective interface designs for many common tasks. They also lend themselves to imaginative and engaging design solutions. Popovers are used in a number of places in 3.12, and will become increasingly common in future versions.
Revamped Initial Setup Assistant
GNOME's initial setup assistant, which helps you get set up when you first run GNOME, has had a facelift for 3.12. Based on usability research funded by the
Upgraded Geolocation
GNOME's new geolocation framework was first introduced in the previous release. Since then it has received a number of updates. Cell tower positioning, GPS and nearby Wi-Fi access points have been added as methods for determining location (GPS is only supported when built into a 3G modem), making positioning more accurate.
Geolocation feedback and controls have also been added for 3.12. An icon is now displayed in the top bar when an application is using location services, and geolocation controls have also been added to the system status menu. More detailed privacy controls are planned for the future.

Restyled Tabs
Tabs have had a design refresh for 3.12. The new visual style works more harmoniously in a variety of contexts, such as when tab content has varied background colors, or when tabs are embedded in other widgets. They also make the most of the screen space available, and the new style offers clear visual hints about the ability to drag tabs.
New Bluetooth Settings

The new Bluetooth settings also include new, redesigned properties dialogs for Bluetooth devices.
Other Improvements
There are many other smaller enhancements to the core user experience for 3.12. These include:
Several technical improvements result in faster startup times.
An updated symbolic icon theme, with many improved icons.
Visual theme refinements, including smoother separators by window close buttons, improved backgrounds for pressed buttons, and more attractive floating toolbars.
Improved animations: several transitions have been animated for 3.12, the startup zoom animation has been refined, and animations for dragging windows to the screen edge have been greatly improved.
Improved keyboard navigation in the
The default wallpaper has been updated to use a new style that matches the default lock screen image. Like previous default wallpapers, this one subtly changes appearance over the course of the day.
Accessibility has been improved for links in labels, menus and the color chooser dialog.

The GNOME project is proud to present GNOME 3.10. The release comes six months after 3.8, and contains 34786 changes by approximately 985 contributors. It contains major new features as well as a large collection of smaller enhancements. 3.10 provides an improved experience for users, as well as new capabilities for application developers.

Integrated System Status
GNOME 3.10 features a new, redesigned system status area. In previous versions, the system status area was made up of a series of menus in the corner of the top bar. The new system status area replaces this with a single menu. This allows you to quickly get an overview of the state of your device, and provides a more focused top bar which only displays information that you care about. Among many improvements, the new menu provides easier mouse interaction, privacy enhancements, a new screen brightness slider, and a better airplane mode.
Header Bars
A new interface element has been introduced in 3.10: header bars. These merge titlebars and toolbars into a single element, giving more screen space to window content. Header bars also allow more dynamic application interfaces whose controls adjust to the current view, and they ensure that window close buttons are always present, irrespective of whether a window is maximized or unmaximized.
GNOME's mission to create a new set of core applications continues in GNOME 3.10. There is a whole collection of new applications in this version, including

The GNOME community is proud to present GNOME 3.8. This new release features numerous new features as well as a host of smaller enhancements.
3.8 is the result of 6 months of work by the GNOME Project and contains 35936 contributions by approximately 960 people. We think that it is the best version of GNOME to date.

GNOME 3.8 features a significant technological breakthrough in the way that animated graphics are rendered. By improving the coordination between the components responsible for displaying animated graphics, far greater efficiency and performance has been achieved. The result of this work is smooth and robust visual transitions and window resizing. Smoother video playback will also be found under some conditions.
Classic Mode
Classic mode is a new feature for those people who prefer a more traditional desktop experience. Built entirely from GNOME 3 technologies, it adds a number of features such as an application menu, a places menu and a window switcher along the bottom of the screen. Each of these features can be used individually or in combination with other GNOME extensions.
Details
GNOME 3.8 includes a huge number of smaller bug fixes and enhancements. Many details have been addressed to give a more polished experience, including new animated transitions, improved visuals and usability fixes. Many of these improvements were made as a part of the Every Detail Matters initiative, which fixed nearly 60 bugs during the 3.8 development cycle.
GNOME's applications have had a lot of improvements for 3.8. We are also releasing previews of two new applications.

In addition to this major achievement,
WebKit2 includes a new plugins system, which means that Flash is now supported. Plugins are also isolated, improving stability.

The page search interface has been improved, and is now more consistent with other GNOME 3 applications.
Media controls for HTML5 content have been revamped, so that they look better and are easier to use.
An undo close tab action has been added: this is a convenient way to get tabs back that you have accidentally closed.
The toolbar has gained a new tab button.


Automatic USB redirection is now included in all new virtual machines, and can be added to existing ones. This makes it possible to use USB devices (cameras, flash drive, etc) from inside a virtual machine.

Windows XP and Windows 7 express installations have been substantially improved. Copy and paste between the host system and the virtual machine now works out of the box, as does automatic adjustment of the virtual machine's screen resolution. Disk usage has also been made more efficient.
It is now possible to connect to virtual machines running on
There have been many user interface improvements and additions, including the ability to pause multiple virtual machines at the same time, improved multi-selection of virtual machines, additional options in the remote connection assistant, and support for changing the CD-ROM device/ISO from the properties view.

XDG Base Directory Specification Usage
Unix-like systems have traditionally lacked a standard way to store application or user data on a per-user basis. Consequently these data are often stored in an ad-hoc, inconsistent, and problematic way in "dot files" of the user's home directory.

Several applications (such as
