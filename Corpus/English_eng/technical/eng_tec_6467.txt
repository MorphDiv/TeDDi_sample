Print Server Configuration: CUPS
Start the print server configuration (now that you have chosen & CUPS;, this is equivalent to the configuration of the & CUPS; daemon) by clicking on the appropriate button. You can find it by moving the mouse slowly over the buttons and reading the tooltips. It should be the 11th from the left, or third from the right; its icon is a wrench.
The & CUPS; Server Configuration window pops up. It gives you a structured view of all the settings that apply to the & CUPS; daemon. The configuration file for that daemon is normally located in / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf. This is a plain ASCII file with a syntax similar to the configuration file of the Apache web server. It is a good idea to create a backup copy, just in case something goes wrong with the configuration through & kdeprint; /CUPS; Server Configuration dialogs:
cp / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf. bak
As this graphical user interface to edit the configuration file is such a new feature, you should have the second chance of resorting to the original file. So back it up, please.
Quick Help
One very nice feature is the Quick Help available. If you click on the little question mark (What's this?) on your window title bar, you'll see the cursor changing its form. Now click on a cupsd configuration setting field to find out what it means and what your options are. In most cases you should understand the meaning immediately, otherwise turn to the excellent & CUPS; documentation. (If your & CUPS; Daemon is running, you have it online on your own host at http: / /localhost:631/ documentation. html.
If & CUPS; is not running, but installed on your system you could find it in your own host's file system. The exact location depends on your & OS;, but on & Linux; the default is / usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ or / usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ documentation. html.)
Longer Help
For the best, most detailed and most recent information you should always refer to the original & CUPS; documentation. & CUPS; is, much like & kde; in a rapid development process. There are constantly new features being added. New features might for times be only configurable by directly editing the configuration files. The & kdeprint; & GUI; might not have caught up with & CUPS; development.
Just in case you want to look at the original configuration files of your & CUPS; system -- they are here:
These paths are based on the default installation. Your & OS; may have installed them to a different prefix, for example, / usr/ local/, but the hierarchy should still match that shown below.
/ etc/ cups/
The folder with the configuration files
/ etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf
The configuration file for the & CUPS; daemon
/ etc/ cups/ printers. conf
The configuration file that contains the information about your locally installed printers.
/ etc/ cups/ ppd/
The folder with & PPD; files of your installed printers.
The following links only work if your & CUPS; daemon is up and running. To access all the original & CUPS; documentation, go to:
http: / /localhost:631/ documentation. html
A page with all the links to the other documents.
http: / /localhost:631/ sam. html
Direct access to the & CUPS; Software Administrator Manual in HTML format.
http: / /localhost:631/ sam. pdf
Direct access to the & CUPS; Software Administrator Manual in PDF format.
http: / /www. cups. org/ documentation. html
The latest on line documentation from the & CUPS; web site.
The following links give you access to the same files (probably icons and graphics will be missing) even if your CUPS daemon is not up and running. You need, however, CUPS installed on your system. (Some distributions might place the files somewhere else -- you're on your own then to find out where...) To access all the original CUPS documentation, go to:
This documentation is available even when the & CUPS; daemon is not installed, although you may find images and icons are missing when you view the HTML files.
As noted above, the hierarchy below should be intact, but your & OS; may have installed & CUPS; to a different location.
/ usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ documentation. html
/ usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ sam. html
/ usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ sam. pdf
There are a few WebSites and Newsgroups discussing & CUPS; (and & Linux; Printing in General) and giving help to newbies at:
http: / /www. cups. org/ newsgroups. php
The & CUPS; website.
http: / /www. linuxprinting. org/ newsportal/
LinuxPrinting. org, the home of the Linuxprinting HOWTO and the & Linux; Printer Database
And finally, there will be a WebSite for & kdeprint; and related documentation, at http: / /kdeprint. sourceforge. net/
In the next section I will step you through most of the configuration options of & kdeprint; with & CUPS;.

The Tabs
Changing printer settings
Welcome to the & CUPS; Server Configuration
This is the Welcome Screen for your server configuration dialogs. Clicking onto one of the items of the tree view on left side of the screen opens the appropriate part of the configuration settings.
Every setting has a default value. The defaults let & CUPS; normally work as a fully functional client. The clients listen on TCP/ IP Port 631 for infos broadcast by & CUPS; servers on the LAN. This information let the clients print immediately after receiving them, without installing any driver or configuring any printer on the clients.
To configure a & CUPS; server (which is broadcasting its service to the LAN) you need to change settings from the defaults.
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server: welcome screen.
CUPS server configuration dialog: welcome screen
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server: welcome screen
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server: welcome screen
To select the default setting of any item just enable the checkbox on the right side of the screen. To set an item to a different value, disable the checkbox and then go on to do the setting you want on the left side of the screen.
The complete server configuration includes:
Server General Configuration
Server Log ging Configuration
Server Folders and Path Definitions
Server HTTP Configuration
Server Encryption and Certificate Support Configuration
Server Misc ellaneous Configuration
Network General Configuration
Network Clients Configuration
Browsing General Configuration
Browsing Connection Configuration
Browsing Masks Configuration
Browsing Timeouts Configuration
Browsing Relay Configuration
Security Configuration
Each of these configuration items will be described in the following sections of the manual.
Server General Configuration
The server general configuration is done on this screen. It includes:
Server name
Administrators email
Server user
Server group
Remote user name
The tab window to configure the & CUPS; server general settings lets you the change the default values. Click on the little question mark and then on one of the fields to get a Quick Help about the meaning of the setting.
If you are unsure, leave alone and turn to the original & CUPS; documentation first. If your & CUPS; daemon is already running, it is readable from the & konqueror; by pointing it to & URL; http: / /localhost:631/ documentation. html.
There, first make friends with the Software Administrator Manual. Otherwise, for example, if the & CUPS; daemon is not running, try looking in your local file system, by default at / usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ or / usr/ share/ doc/ cups/ documentation. html.
& CUPS; server general configuration dialog: ServerName, AdminMail, ServerUser, ServerGroup, RemoteUserName
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server general settings: ServerName, AdminMail, ServerUser, ServerGroup, RemoteUserName
Server Name
The hostname of your server, as advertised to the world. By default, & CUPS; will use the hostname of the system. To set the default server usd by clients, see the client. conf file.
For example, enter myhost. domain. com
This is the hostname that is reported to clients. Should you ever encounter strange problems in accessing the server, put here its IP address for troubleshooting. This way you eliminate any potential name resolution problems; and you can more easily nail the real problem down.
This is the email address to send all complaints or problems to. By default & CUPS; will use root@hostname.
For example, enter root@myhost. com.
Contrary to what the quickhelp suggests, it is also legal to send an email full of praise and enthusiasm about & CUPS; and & kdeprint; to the server administrator.
Server User
The user the server runs under. Normally this must be lp, however you can configure things for another user if needed.
The server must be initially run as root to support the default IPP port of 631. It changes users whenever an external program is run.
Enter for example lp.
This is the & UNIX; user account for filters and CGI programs to run under. (CGI programs are responsible for showing you the nice web administration interface accessible via http: / /localhost:631/).
There is no need to set the User directive to root, so never do this, as it only involves dangers. Should anyone discover security vulnerabilities in one of the used file filters, printer drivers or CGI programs, he could remotely execute arbitrary commands on your system with root user privileges. Always use an unprivileged account for the server directive User.
The group the server runs under. Normally this must be sys, however you can configure things for another group as needed.
Enter for example sys.
The name of the user assigned to unauthenticated accesses from remote systems. By default remroot.
This name will appear in log files and in queries about the job owner & etc;, for all resources and locations of the & CUPS; server that are configured to allow access without authentication. Authenticated entries will carry the authenticated names.
Server Logging Configuration
The server logging configuration is done on this screen. It includes:
Access log file setting
Error log file setting
Page log file setting
Log level setting
Max log file size setting
This is an important screen for you. Should you ever encounter problems: here is the place to set the Log level to debug, restart the & CUPS; daemon and then look at the Error log file defined here for entries that might give you an insight to the trouble.
& CUPS; server configuration dialog: Server logging
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server: Server logging
Access log file
This is where accesses to the server are logged. If this does not start with a leading /, then it is assumed to be relative to the server root.
You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon.
Enter a path, for example / var/ log/ cups/ acces_log.
The format of this file is stored in the so-called Common Log Format. This way you can use programs such as Webalyzer or any other Web access reporting tool to generate reports on the & CUPS; server activities.
To include the server name in the file name use a %s in the name. Example: / var/ log/ cups/ access_log-%s.

You see a separate line for each single access, showing the IP address of the accessing client, date and time of access, method of access (POST or GET), the requested resource, the & HTTP; version used by the client, status code and the number of transferred bytes. Status code 200 means successful-OK the 401 in the above example was an unauthorized access which was denied. For a detailed explanation of the log format go to the & CUPS; Software Administrator Manual.
Error log file
If this does not start with a leading /, then it is assumed to be relative to the server root. The default setting is / var/ log/ cups/ error_log.
Enter the path, for example / var/ log/ cups/ error_log.
The error log excerpt below shows you the part logged for printing the test page with the default setting of Log level to info. For an explanation of the Log Level setting see further below.

Page log file
If this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to the server root. The default is / var/ log/ cups/ page_log
Enter the path, for example / var/ log/ cups/ page_log.
The page log file has a line for every single page of every job printed.
Here is what some entries look like:

In this excerpt of the file you find information on the name of the printers (GIMP_print_stp_HP and DANKA_infotec_P450) used through this server, the user names (kdetest, kurt and root), the job-IDs (201 to 205), time of printing, page number inside the job and the number of copies for the pages. For example, job-ID 204 had 4 pages and 33 copies printed, job-ID 205 had 14 copies of just 1 page).
& CUPS; is dependent (for its calculation of the number of pages in a job) on passing the & PostScript; through the pstops filter. (See the kivio; Flowchart on the & CUPS; filter architecture for an idea about were this filter fits into the whole printing process.) More, pstops depends for the counting on a DSC conforming (DSC is Document Structuring Conventions, a standard defined by Adobe) to be sent by the client. In most cases this is working.
However, this page accounting does not work for any raw printer queues (as those, by definition, do n't use any filtering on the & CUPS; host and are by-passing pstops.) Every job going through a raw queue is counted as a 1-page-job (with possibly multiple copies). This is especially true for all Jobs sent from & Microsoft; & Windows; clients via Samba to the & CUPS; server, as those jobs are already arriving in the correct format for the printer, because the clients use the original printer driver.
I am still looking for someone who will write a nice & CUPS; page log analysing tool. It should generate a report with a graphical output similar to the Webalizer's access log reports. This way you could have nice statistics to be used for accounting about usage of printers, load dependent on daytime or weekday, users & etc; Anyone?
Log level
This setting controls the number of messages logged to the error log file. It can be one of the following:
debug2
Log everything.
debug
Log almost everything.
info
Log all requests and state changes.
warn
Log errors and warnings.
error
Log only errors.
none
Log nothing.
If you need to troubleshoot (or if you want to study the inner workings of & CUPS;), set the log level to debug or debug2. Then the error_log will have a lot more entries (not just errors, but also informational entries).
You can use this to watch live what & CUPS; is doing when you send a print job. In a & konsole; type:
kurt@transmeta: ~ > tail -f -n 100 / var/ log/ cups/ error_log
This will give you the last 100 lines (-n 100) of the file onto the screen and a realtime update (-f) of what is happening. The following listing shows the printing of a test page (some pieces have been cut off for space reasons... Try it yourself if you need more info):

Max log file size
Controls the maximum size of each log file before they are rotated. Defaults to 1048576 (1 Mb). Set this to 0 to disable log rotation.
Enter an size in bytes, for example 1048576
Server Folders Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server. Different folders are to be set here. Normally you do n't need to change anything in this section. In case you play around with fancy (TrueType, & PostScript; or other) fonts on your system, this is the place to do the settings for using those fonts when printing. Server folder settings include:
Executables: where to find the server executables
Configuration: where to find the server configuration files
Data: where to find the server data files
Temporary files: where to put the server temporary print files
Temporary Requests: where to find the server
Font Path: where to find the server fonts
& CUPS; server configuration dialog: & HTTP; configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server: & HTTP; configuration
Executables
The root folder for the scheduler executables. By default this is / usr/ lib/ cups (or / usr/ lib32/ cups on IRIX 6.5)
Configuration
The root folder for the scheduler. By default, / etc/ cups.
On the authors SuSE system, this is / usr/ share/ doc/ cups. It contains all the HTML or PDF documentation for & CUPS; which is available through the Web interface at http: / /localhost:631/ documentation. html
Data
The root folder for the & CUPS; data files. By default this is / usr/ share/ cups
It contains such things as banners, charsets, data, drivers, fonts, and pstoraster templates.
Temporary files
The folder to put temporary files in. This folder must be writable by the user defined on the previous screen. This defaults to either / var/ spool/ cups/ tmp or the value of the TMPDIR environment variable.
Temporary Requests
The folder where request files are stored. By default this is / var/ spool/ cups
Font path
The place to configure the & CUPS; server for handling your fancy fonts (TrueType or & PostScript;). & CUPS; will look here for fonts to embed in printfiles. This currently only affects the pstoraster filter, and the default is / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts.
To specify more than one folder, list them with double colons as separator. Do it like this:
/ path/ to/ first/ fontdir/: / path/ to/ second/ fontdir/: / path/ to/ last/ fontdir/
For the Font path directive to work as intended, the application that wants to print needs to:
Either correctly reference its desired fonts in the header of the generated & PostScript;
Or embed the font into the & PostScript; file.
Referencing the font by name leaves it up to the RIP and print device to respect and actually use it. RIP or printer can only use the desired font, if it is available on the system.
In the case of a & PostScript; printer, this needs to be a printer-resident font. If the printers does n't have this font, it will try and replace it by an adequately similar font.
In the case of a non & PostScript; printer, this is done by & CUPS; and its RIP -ing filtering system. & CUPS; will use the font path directive to grab the correct font when RIP -ing the & PostScript; in the pstoraster filter.
In the case of a & PostScript; output device, & CUPS; is just spooling the file (actually, it is passing it through the pstops filter for accounting or n-up purposes), not working on it. Therefore, if you print to a & PostScript; printer it is solely the printer's responsibility to use the font asked for. It ca n't, if the font is neither loaded into the printer nor embedded in the & PostScript;.
Server HTTP Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server & HTTP; settings is shown here.
& CUPS; server & HTTP; settings are the following ones:
the Document folder
the Default Language
the Default Charset
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server & HTTP; settings
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server & HTTP; settings
Document folder
The root folder for & HTTP; documents that are served. By default the compiled in folder, / usr/ share/ cups/ doc
Default Language
The default language, if not specified by the browser. If not specified, the current locale is used.
Use the two letter locale codes, for example en or de.
Default charset
The default character set to use. If not specified, this defaults to UTF-8. This can also be overridden directly in the HTML documents.
Server encryption support configuration
This is the dialog to configure the & CUPS; server security settings. The server encryption support settings are these:
Server certificate: the file to read containing the server's certificate
Server key: the file to read containing the server's key
& CUPS; server configuration dialog: security overview
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server: security settings
Server certificate
The file to read containing the server's certificate. Defaults to / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt.
Server key
The file to read containing the server's key. Defaults to / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key
Server Miscellaneous Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server miscellaneous settings is shown here. The following server settings are done through this screen:
Preserve job history: whether to preserve a job history for later re-view
Preserve job files: whether to preserve fully RIP -ed job files for later re-print
Printcap file: setting the name of and the path to a printcap file
RIP Cache: setting the size of the RIP cache in memory
Filter Limit: defining a filter limit
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server miscellaneous settings
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server miscellaneous settings
Preserve job history (after completion)
Whether or not to preserve the job history after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. The default is yes
Preserve job file (after completion)
Whether or not to preserve the job files after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. The default is no.
Printcap file
The name of the printcap file. The default is no filename. Leave this blank, to disable printcap file generation.
The printcap setting is only needed to satisfy older applications in need of such a file.
RIP cache
The amount of memory that each RIP should use to cache bitmaps. The value can be any real number, followed by k for kilobytes, m for megabytes, g for gigabytes, or t for tiles, where one tile is 256 x 256 pixels. The default value is 8m.
Filter limit
Sets the maximum cost of all job filters that can be run at the same time. A limit of 0 means no limit. A typical job may need a filter limit of at least 200. Limits less than the minimum required by a job force a single job to be printed at any time. The default limit is 0 (unlimited).
Network General Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server network settings is shown here. It includes:
Look for hostname on IP addresses
Port
Max request size
Timeout
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server network settings
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server network settings
Whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a fully-qualified hostname. This defaults to off, for performance reasons.
Enter here Ports and addresses that the server will listen to. The default port 631 is reserved for the Internet Printing Protocol, and is what we use here.
You can have multiple entries, to listen to more than one port or address, or to restrict access.
Unfortunately, most web browsers do n't support TLS or & HTTP; upgrades for encryption. If you want to support web-based encryption, you'll probably need to listen on port 443, the HTTPS port.
Use the Add and Remove buttons to add and remove entries from the list.
You can enter ports on their own, & eg; 631, or hostnames with ports, & eg; myhost:80 or 1.2.3.4:631.
Controls the maximum size of & HTTP; requests and print files. The default setting is 0, which disables this feature.
The timeout (in seconds) before requests time out. The default is 300 seconds.
Network Clients Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; network client settings is shown here. It includes:
Accept "Keep Alive" requests
KeepAliveTimeout:
MaxClients:
dialog to configure the & CUPS; network client settings
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; network client settings
Whether or not to support the Keep-Alive connection option. The default is on.
Keep alive timeout
The timeout (in seconds) before Keep-Alive connections are automatically closed. The default is 60 seconds.
Max number of clients
Controls the maximum number of simultaneous clients that will be handled. Defaults to 100.
Browsing General Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; browsing general settings is shown here. It includes:
Enable browsing
Use short names when possible
Use implicit classes
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; browsing general settings
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; browsing general settings
Whether or not to broadcast printer information to other & CUPS; servers. Enabled by default.
Whether or not to use short names for remote printers when possible (eg; printer instead of printer@host). Enabled by default.
Whether or not to use implicit classes.
Printer classes can be specified explicitly, in the classes. conf file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or both.
When Implicit classes are enabled, printers on the LAN with the same name (eg; Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN without a lot of administrative difficulties. If a user sends a job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available queue.
This option is enabled by default.
Browsing Connection Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server browsing connection is shown here. Browsing connection settings include:
Broadcast addresses: The (UDP) broadcast address to transmit printer information to
Broadcast Port: The port number to use for broadcasting
Poll addresses: The address(es) to poll for information about printers on servers that might not broadcast (or whose broadcasts might not reach your LAN due to routers in between).

Broadcast addresses
After pressing the Add button, you will see the following dialog to enter a new value for outgoing broadcasting browse packets. It is the same kind of dialog as for adding other & CUPS; server addresses to be polled for printer information.
Dialog to enter a new value for broadcasting browse packets to
Dialog to enter a new value for broadcasting browse packets to
This option specifies a broadcast address to be used. By default, browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces.
& HP-UX; 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless you have a Class A, B, C or D netmask (ie;, there is no CIDR support).
Broadcast port
The port used for UDP broadcasts. By default this is the IPP port; if you change this, you need to do it on all servers. Only one BrowsePort is recognized.
Poll addresses
Poll the named server(s) for printers.
Browsing Masks Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server allowed and/ or denied browse packets from other servers is shown here.
Browse allow:

Browse allow and Browse deny
Browse allow specifies an address mask to allow for incoming browser packets. The default is to allow packets from all addresses.
Browse deny specifies an address mask to deny for incoming browser packets. The default is to deny packets from no addresses.
Both Browse allow and Browse deny accept the following notations for addresses:
All
None
*. domain. com
. domain. com
host. domain. com
nnn. *
nnn. nnn. *
nnn. nnn. nnn. *
nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn
nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm
nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm
The hostname/ domain name restrictions will only work if you have turned hostname lookups on!
Browse order
Specifies the order of the allow/ deny comparisons.
Browsing Timeouts Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server browse timeout settings is shown here. Browse timeout settings include:
Browse Interval
Browse Timeout
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server browse timeout settings
dialog to configure the & CUPS; server browse timeout settings
Browse interval
The time between browsing updates in seconds. The default is 30 seconds.
Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates.
Set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are not advertised, but you can still see printers on other hosts.
Browse timeouts
The timeout (in seconds) for network printers - if we do n't get an update within this time, the printer will be removed from the printer list.
This number definitely should not be less than the browse interval period, for obvious reasons. Defaults to 300 seconds.
Browsing Relay Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server as a browsing relay is shown here. Browsing relay settings include:
Browser packets relay
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server as a browsing relay
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server as a browsing relay
Add Browse Relay dialog
The dialog to enter a new value for an address pair to define browsing relaying between a & CUPS; server and a network is shown here.
The dialog to enter a new value for an address pair to define browsing relaying between a & CUPS; server and a network
The dialog to enter a new value for an address pair to define browsing relaying between a & CUPS; server and a network
Relay browser packets from one address or network to another.
Security Configuration
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server security settings for any of the defined server locations is shown here. It contains the following settings, which may be defined separately for any valid resource (or location) of the & CUPS; server:
System Group:
Access Permissions:
Auth Type:
Auth Class:
Auth Group Name:
Encryption:
Allow:
Deny:
Order:
Valid resources (or locations) of the & CUPS; server are:
Server Root Location: /
Server Administration Location: / admin
All printers on the server: / printers
Any individual printer on the server: & eg; / printers/ infotec_P320
All printer classes on the server: / classes:
Any individual printer class on the server: & eg; / classes/ all_infotecs_P320_or_P450
Dialog to configure the & CUPS; server security settings for any of the defined server locations
dialog to configure the & CUPS; server security settings for any of the defined server locations
For all locations that are not defined separately the setting of the location above it is valid.
For example, you have a printer named infotec_P450 with no set security options. Then the security of the location / printers will take the responsibility for this printer as it is a sub-location of / printers. If, in turn there is no security set for / printers, then the security for / (the general security) of the server takes responsibility. Either you have set this for your purpose or the compiled-in default value takes over.
SystemGroup
The group name for System or printer administration access. The default varies depending on the operating system, but will be sys, system or root (checked for in that order).
Access Permissions
Access permissions for each folder served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to the document root.
Authorization Type
The authorization to use:
None
Perform no authentication.
Basic
Perform authentication using the & HTTP; Basic method.
Digest
Perform authentication using the & HTTP; Digest method.
Local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for Basic or Digest, when connecting to the localhost interface.
Authorization Class
The authorization class. Currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to the group set as system group), and group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
Authorization Group Name
The group name for Group authorization
Encryption
Whether or not to use encryption. This depends on having the OpenSSL linked into the & CUPS; library and scheduler.
Possible values are:
Always
Always use encryption (SSL)
Never
Never use encryption.
Required
Use TLS encryption upgrade.
IfRequested
Use encryption if the server requests it.
Allow
Allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address or network. Possible values are:
The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups, as described earlier.
Deny
Denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address or network. Possible values are:
Order
The order of the allow and deny processing.
Example: How To Define The Security For All Printers
The dialog to configure the & CUPS; server security settings is discussed here. We use the example to add security definitions other than the default ones for the resource named all printers. For the & CUPS; web server, this is the location you access through http: / /localhost:631/ printers/ or (remotely) through http: / /cups. server. name:631/ printers/
The first screenshot shows the general location for this setting. Select Add or Modify a resource for which you want to decide about its security settings.
