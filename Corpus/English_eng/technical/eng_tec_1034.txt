HTML Export - Page 2
Determines the type of publication.
You can specify if you want to include frames, create a title, or display presentation notes.
Publication type
Defines the basic settings for the intended export.
Standard HTML format
Creates standard HTML pages from export pages.
Standard HTML with frames
Creates standard HTML pages with frames.
The exported page will be placed in the main frame, and the frame to the left will display a table of contents in the form of hyperlinks.
Create title page
Creates a title page for your document.
Show notes
Specifies that your notes are also displayed.
Automatic
Creates a default HTML presentation as a kiosk export, in which the slides are automatically advanced after a specified amount of time.
As stated in document
The slide transition depends on the timing that you set for each slide in the presentation.
If you set a manual page transition, the HTML presentation introduces a new page by pressing any key from your keyboard.
Automatic
The page transition takes place automatically after the specified period of time elapses and does not depend on the presentation's contents
.
Slide view time
Defines the amount of time for each slide display.
Endless
Automatically restarts the HTML presentation after the last slide has been displayed.
WebCast
In a WebCast export, automatic scripts will be generated with Perl or ASP support.
This enables the speaker (for example, a speaker in a telephone conference using a slide show on the Internet) to change the slides in the audience's web browsers.
You will find more information on
WebCast
later in this section.
Active Server Pages (ASP)
ASP
option, the WebCast export creates ASP pages.
Note that the HTML presentation can only be offered by a web server supporting ASP.
Perl
Used by WebCast export to create HTML pages and Perl scripts.
URL for listeners
Specifies the URL (absolute or relative) to be entered by the viewer in order to see the presentation.
URL for presentation
Specifies the URL (absolute or relative), where the created HTML presentation on the web server has been saved.
URL for Perl scripts
Specifies the URL (absolute or relative) for the generated Perl scripts.
More Information on WebCast Export
There are two possible options for exporting $[officename] Impress presentations using WebCast technology:
Active Server Pages (ASP) and Perl.
In either case, the WebCast needs an HTTP server offering either Perl or ASP as scripting.
Therefore, the exporting option depends on the HTTP server used.
WebCast in ASP
Exporting
File - Export
.
You then see the
Export
dialogue box in which you select
HTML Document
as the file type.
Once you have selected a directory and entered a file name, click
Save
.
For export as ASP, we recommend selecting a &quot; secret &quot; file name for the HTML file (see below for more details).
You then see the
HTML Export
dialogue box.
Several files will be written to the directory you have just selected.
The presenter uses the entered file name to change between the slides viewed by the audience.
You can save the WebCast files locally or save them directly to an HTTP server.
You can later transfer locally saved files to the HTTP server by FTP.
Note that WebCast only works if the files are requested over an HTTP server.
Do not use the same directory for two different HTML exports.
WebCast
as a publishing type on the second page of the HTML Export Wizard.
Active Server Pages (ASP)
option.
You can now continue defining other settings or start the export by clicking the
Create
button.
Using ASP WebCast
You can use WebCast as soon as the exported files can be accessed from an HTTP server.
Example:
Let's assume that you installed the Microsoft Internet Information Server on your computer.
You entered the &quot; c:\Inet\wwwroot\presentation &quot; directory as an HTML output directory during the IIS set-up.
The URL of your computer is assumed as follows: &quot; http://myserver.com &quot; .
You have saved the files that have been created during the Export process in the c:\Inet\wwwroot\presentation\ directory.
In this directory, the Export creates an HTML file that can be named, for example, as &quot; secret.htm &quot; .
You entered this name in the Save dialogue box (see above).
The presenter can now browse to the HTML Export files by entering the http://myserver.com/presentation/secret.htm URL in any HTTP Browser having JavaScript support.
The presenter is now able to modify the page using some form controls.
The audience can now view the slide selected by the presenter through the URL http://myserver.com/presentation/webcast.asp.
They cannot move to other slides found at this URL, unless the file names are known.
Please ensure that the HTTP server does not show the directory listing.
WebCast over Perl
Exporting
File - Export
.
This opens the
Export
dialogue box, in which you select
HTML Document
as the file type.
After selecting a folder and entering a file name, click
Save
.
This opens the
HTML Export Wizard
.
This will write some files to the folder you have just selected.
The entered file name will be used by the presenter to switch through the slides.
Please select an empty directory.
WebCast
as the publication type.
Perl
.
URL for listeners
text box, enter the file name of the HTML document that will be used by the audience.
In
URL for presentation
, enter the URL of the directory that will be used for the presentation and, in
URL for Perl scripts
, enter the URL for the CGI script directory.
You can now define further settings on the following pages of the Wizard or start the export process by clicking the
Create
button.
Using Perl WebCast
The files that have been created during the export must now be set up in the Perl enabled HTTP server.
This cannot be done automatically because of the variety of different HTTP servers having Perl support.
The steps to follow will be described next.
Please refer to your server manual or ask your network administrator how to apply these steps on your server.
You should first move the files that have been created during the export into the correct directory on the HTTP server.
URL for presentation
.
URL for Perl scripts
text box.
This directory must be configured in a way that the Perl scripts contained there can also be run by an HTTP request.
On UNIX systems grant the files with the pl extension the rights to be executable by the HTTP server.
Normally, this is done with the chmod command.
The rights of the currpic.txt file must be set to be writable by the HTTP server.
Now you should be able to use WebCast.
Example:
URL for listeners
.
In the
URL for presentation
text box enter http://myserver.com/presentation/ and for the
URL for Perl scripts
enter http://myserver.com/cgi-bin/.
Now, copy all *.htm, *.jpg and *.gif files from the directories that were specified during the export into the //user/local/http/presentation/ directory on your HTTP Server and copy all files with the *.pl and *.txt extensions into the //user/local/http/cgi-bin/ directory.
Login on your server as root and switch to the //user/local/http/cgi-bin/ directory.
You can define the corresponding rights using the chmod command.
Once you have finished installing the Perl files, the presenter will be able to give the presentation.
The listeners can view this presentation under the URL http://myserver.com/presentation/presentation.htm.
