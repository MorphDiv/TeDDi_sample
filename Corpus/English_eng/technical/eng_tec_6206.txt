Automatic Text Completion
You can get & konqueror; to help you enter a path or & URL; into the Location Toolbar by enabling one of the Text Completion features. To do this right click on a clear part of the Location Toolbar text entry box and select Text Completion from the pop up menu. This will let you choose between the following options:
None
What you get is what you type.
Manual
When you have typed part of a path or & URL;, pressing Ctrl; E will complete the entry if it is possible to do so unambiguously.
Automatic
As you type into the Location Toolbar window & konqueror; will automatically extend what you type to complete one possible path or & URL;, highlighting the characters it has added. Continue typing if that's not what you wanted or press & Enter; to accept it.
Dropdown List
A drop-down window will appear as you type, showing the possible matches to what you have typed so far. When the path or & URL; that you want appears in the window double click on it with the & LMB;. You can also use the Down Arrow and Up Arrow keys to select it then press & Enter;.
Short Automatic
This is like Automatic mode except that it only extends what you have typed as far as the next / symbol in the path or & URL;. Press Ctrl; E to accept the suggestion, & Enter; when the complete path or & URL; is shown.
You should try out these different modes and pick the one that suits you best.
The history of recently visited & URL; s that & konqueror; uses for the Text Completion function can be viewed and edited in the History page of the Navigation Panel.
