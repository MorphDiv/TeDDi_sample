Introduction
& rocs; aims to be a Graph Theory IDE for helping professors to show the results of a graph algorithm and also helping students to do the algorithms.
& rocs; has a scripting module, done in Qt Script, that interacts with the drawn graph and every change in the graph with the script is reflected on the drawn one.
Using & rocs;
The user interface is divided in two parts:
the top right part is where you draw your graphs, and the bottom right one is where you create your algorithms,
the left sidebar is where all your open graphs stay, you can open multiple graphs per file.
& rocs; global settings
On the left sidebar you can find the options for each opened graph, all these options are global per graph and can be changed per node and edge with the Node Properties and the Edge Properties dialogs.
Graph Name
Default Node Color for new created nodes, you can change the node color for all current nodes by clicking the All button
Default Edge Color
The last row of options consists in toggled buttons:
Oriented Graph
Automated Graph
Show nodes names
Show edges names
Show nodes values
Show edges values
& rocs; toolbars
There are two toolbars, on the top. The main one has the following tools:
Move Node: moves a node around the drawing area.
Add Node: creates a new node at the clicked position on the drawing area.
Add Edge: creates a new edge between two nodes.
Select: select items by clicking on them.
Delete: delete items by clicking on them.
A right mouse click on a node or edge brings you the property dialog for that node or edge.
The layout toolbar consists in various aligns icons.
To align nodes, choose the Select tool, click and drag a rectangle, then choose the alignement that you want.
Scripting & rocs;
After the graph is on screen, you can start creating the script for it. The language uses a Javascript syntax and following are the Graph, Node and Edge objects.
Graph
array list_nodes(); array list_edges(); node add_node(name); edge add_edge(from, to); node node_byname(QStringamp; name); node begin_node(); array end_nodes();
Graph variables that can be changed:
bool directed bool automate string name string nodeDefaultColor / / in HEXA string edgeDefaultColor / / in HEXA
Nodes
array adj_nodes(); array adj_edges(); array input_edges(); array output_edges(); array loop_edges(); array connected_edges(Node *n); void self_remove();
Node Variables:
double x double y double width string value string name string color / / in HEXA bool begin bool end
Edges
string color (em hexa) string value string name double width string style (dot, dash, dash dot, solid) node start(); node end(); void self_remove();
Example
Here is a simple script example that sets the color of the 4 first nodes in the first graph:
/ * A simple example that sets the color of the 4 first nodes in the first graph: */ var colours = new Array("red "," green "," blue "," yellow "); / * graphs is an array of graphs, you can access a graph by its index in the array or by its name, so if the first graph's name is Untitled0, the following sentence are right */ var list1= graphs[0]. list_nodes(); / / 1st form. var list2=Untitled0. list_nodes(); / / 2nd form for (var i = 0; i & lt; colours. length; i++){ if (i > list2. length) break; list2[i]. color = colours[i]}
