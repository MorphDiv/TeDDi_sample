KDE Printing Management

Printers The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.) What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system.
