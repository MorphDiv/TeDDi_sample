Pencil tool
The Pencil tool is used to draw free hand lines with a hard edge. The pencil and paintbrush are similar tools. The main difference between the two tools is that although both use the same type of brush, the pencil tool will not produce fuzzy edges, even with a very fuzzy brush. It does not even do anti-aliasing.
Why would you want to work with such a crude tool? Perhaps the most important usage is when working with very small images, such as icons, where you operate at a high zoom level and need to get every pixel exactly right. With the pencil tool, you can be confident that every pixel within the brush outline will be changed in exactly the way you expect.

Eraser
Transparency
Eraser tool
Eraser tool icon in the Toolbox
The Eraser is used to remove areas of color from the current layer or from a selection of this layer. If the Eraser is used on something that does not support transparency (a selection mask channel, a layer mask, or the Background layer if it lacks an alpha channel), then erasing will show the background color, as displayed in the Color Area of the Toolbox (in case of a mask, the selection will be modified). Otherwise, erasing will produce either partial or full transparency, depending on the settings for the tool options. You can learn more on how to add an alpha channel to a layer in
Eraser and Alpha channel
The Background Color is White. The image has no Alpha channel. The Eraser (Opacity 100%) shows the BG color.
The image has an Alpha channel. The Eraser shows transparency.
If you need to erase some group of pixels completely, leaving no trace behind of their previous contents, you should check the "Hard edge" box in the Tool Options. Otherwise, sub-pixel brush placement will cause partial erasure at the edges of the brush-stroke, even if you use a hard-edged brush.
If you use GIMP with a tablet, you may find it convenient to treat the reverse end of the stylus as an eraser. To make this work, all you need to do is click the reverse end on the Eraser tool in the Toolbox. Because each end of the stylus is treated as a separate input device, and each input device has its own separate tool assignment, the reverse end will then continue to function as an Eraser as long as you don't select a different tool with it.

To understand how anti-erasing is possible, you should realize that erasing (or cutting, for that matter) only affects the alpha channel, not the RGB channels that contain the image data. Even if the result is completely transparent, the RGB data is still there, you simply can't see it. Anti-erasing increases the alpha value so that you can see the RGB data once again.
Selection

You can use the Eraser tool to change the shape of a floating selection. By erasing, you can trim the edges of the selection.

The Paint Dynamics Matrix
Dynamics Matrix
The main part of the edit dialog is a table where you can decide which brush parameters should be affected by the way you use the stylus or the mouse. You can enable as many parameters and parameter combinations you want, but usually the fewer the better.
Each column in the table represents a stylus or mouse action except the random and the fade functions. All functions works with graphic tablet. Some of the functions are also available using the mouse. These functions are marked in the tables. The descriptions are using the default settings of all functions







Each row shows a brush parameter and seven check-boxes, one for each action. You connect the parameters to the actions by clicking the appropriate boxes. Clicking on a selected box will unselect the connection.














TO DO
Color
By default the color is picked from the foreground color in the toolbox. However, if the color is activated in the dynamics editor, the color is instead collected from the active gradient.




Hardness
The hardness option is useful only for fuzzy brushes.



Force
Aspect Ratio
The Aspect Ratio Slider in the Tool Options Dialog must be set to other values than the default value of 0.00 to activate the dynamics. If the aspect ratio slider is set to a negative value the width of the brush will vary while the height of the brush is constant. If the slider is set to a positive value only the height of the brush will vary.




Spacing
Spacing is the distance between the marks set by the brush when drawing lines. With this option set the spacing is affected by how the stylus or mouse is used.




Rate
This option applies to the Airbrush, Convolve tool, and Smudge tool, all of which have time-based effects.
The actions of these tools are more or less quick. The amount of Rate depends on the setting of the Rate slider in the Tool Options dialog.
Flow
Significant only for the Airbrush: more or less paint is delivered. The amount of flow depends on the setting of the Flow slider in the Tool Options dialog.
Jitter
Normally the brush draws a line by printing the brush marks close together. Adding jitter means that the brush prints are scattered along the line. The amount of scattering depends on the setting of the jitter slider in the Tool Options dialog window.





Customizing the Dynamics
If the current options do not suits you, you may fine-tune the settings from the Paint Dynamics Editor. Click on the down arrow to open the drop down menu and then select what option to change.
The Fine Tuning Curve
Click on one of the options to open the customizing dialog. The upper part of the dialog contains a curve where you can adjust the behaviour of the chosen parameters selected in the lower part of the dialog. You can drag the curve by pointing on it with the mouse pointer, holding down the left mouse button and the move the curve wherever you want inside the diagram.
Dynamics Examples

The examples shown are very brief, but will perhaps give you an idea of how to use this functions. Feel free to try other combinations. In these examples the foreground color is set to blue (#0000ff) and the background color to yellow (#ffff00). Fading: 200 pixels. Paintbrush size: 72. All other settings are the default values except for those values changed
Example 1 shows the result when the brush size is connected to the fading. Default options. The brush size starts as zero and increase to the size set in the brush size slider in the Tools Options Dialog.
In example 2 the brush size is still connected to the fade tool, but the fade curve is set as in image 5. The brush size starts at zero, fades up to full size and then fades down to zero again.
The full fade length is set along the x-axis from left to right. The y-axis determines the size of the brush. At the bottom the brush size is zero, and at the top of the diagram the brush is set to the full size according to the size set in the slider in the Brush Options Dialog. Study the example and the curve to see the relationship.
In example 3 the brush size is disconnected from the fade tool. The color is connected with the fade option with the curve set as in image 6. At the start of the drawing the color is picked from the left side of the gradient, then gradually more from the right side of the gradient and then finally fading back to the left side again.
As usual the x-axis is the total fade length. When the curve is near the bottom of the diagram the color is picked from the left side of the gradient. With the curve at the top of the diagram the color is picked from the right side of the gradient.
The last example shows a combination of these two settings. Both the size of the brush and the color are connected to the fading function with the curves set as in image 5 and 6.
Many of the dynamics behaviors also depends on the settings of the Dynamics Options in the Tool Options dialog and vice versa. For example the fading will not work if it is not applied in the Dynamics section.
Fade Options
This slider determines the length of the fading. What will actually happen depends on the setting of the Dynamic. If set to act on the color for example, the color will be taken from the current gradient starting from the left side of the gradient and moving toward the right side of the gradient.
The Fade Options has a drop down list determining how the fading is repeated.

Tool options shared by paint tools
Many tool options are shared by several paint tools: these are described here. Options that apply only to one specific tool, or to a small number of tools, are described in the sections devoted to those tools.
Painting Modes
Mode
The Mode drop-down list provides a selection of paint application modes. As with the opacity, the easiest way to understand what the Mode setting does is to imagine that the paint is actually applied to a layer above the layer you are working on, with the layer combination mode in the Layers dialog set to the selected mode. You can obtain a great variety of special effects in this way. The Mode option is only usable for tools that can be thought of as adding color to the image: the Pencil, Paintbrush, Airbrush, Ink, and Clone tools. For the other paint tools, the option appears for the sake of consistency but is always grayed out. A list of modes can be found in
In this list, some modes are particular and are described
Brush opacity
Brush
The Opacity slider sets the transparency level for the brush operation. To understand how it works, imagine that instead of altering the active layer, the tool creates a transparent layer above the active layer and acts on that layer. Changing Opacity in the Tool Options has the same effect that changing opacity in the Layers dialog would have in the latter situation. It controls the
The brush determines how much of the image is affected by the tool, and how it is affected, when you trace out a brushstroke with the pointer.
This option lets you to modify precisely the size of the brush. You can use the arrow keys to vary by ±0.01 or the Page-Up and Page-Down keys to vary by ±1.00. You can obtain the same result if you have correctly set your mouse-wheel in the Preferences. See
This determines the ratio between the height and the width of the brush. The slider is scaled from -20.00 to 20.00 with the default value set to 0.00. A negative value from 0.00 to -20 will narrow the height of the brush while a positive value between 0.00 and 20.00 indicates the narrowing rate of the width of the brush.
This option makes the brush turn round its center. This is visible if the brush is not circular or made from a rotated figure.
Brush Dynamics
The Brush Dynamics in the Tool Options Dialog
Brush dynamics let you map different brush parameters to several input dynamics. They are mostly used with graphic tablets, but some of them are also usable with a mouse.
You can read more about dynamics in

Incremental
The incremental check-box does not seems to work as everyone expect. If it is deactivated (the default value) the maximum effect of a single stroke is determined by the opacity set in the opacity slider. If the opacity is set to less than 100, moving the brush over the same spot will increase the opacity if the brush is lifted in the meantime. Painting over with the same stroke has no such effect. If Incremental is active the brush will paint with full opacity independent of the slider's setting. This option is available for all paint tools except those which have a

Dissolve
Dissolve mode example
Two brush-strokes made with the Airbrush, using the same fuzzy circular brush. Left: Normal mode. Right: Dissolve mode.
For any paint tool with opacity less than 100%, this very useful mode doesn't draw transparency but determines the probability of applying paint. This gives nice patterns of dots to paint-strokes or filling.
Painting in Dissolve mode
This image has only the background layer and no Alpha channel. The background color is sky blue. Three strokes with Pencil and various opacities: 100%, 50%, 25%. Foreground color pixels are scattered along brushstroke.

Paint Modes
Behind (paint mode)
Example for layer mode
Wilber over a blue background layer
Layers dialog
Filled with pattern
This mode applies paint only to transparent areas of the layer: the lower the opacity, the more paint is applied. Thus, painting opaque areas has no effect; painting transparent areas has the same effect as normal mode. The result is always an increase in opacity. Of course none of this is meaningful for layers that lack an alpha channel.
In the above example image, Wilber is on the top layer, surrounded by transparency. The lower layer is solid light blue. The Bucket Fill tool was used, with the
The next image (below) has two layers. The upper layer is active. Three brushtrokes with pencil, red color at 100%, 50%, 25%: only transparent or semi-transparent pixels of the layer are painted.

Further Information
Advanced users may be interested to know that paint tools actually operate at a sub-pixel level, in order to avoid producing jagged-looking results. One consequence of this is that even if you work with a hard-edged brush, such as one of the Circle brushes, pixels on the edge of the brushstroke will only be partially affected. If you need to have all-or-nothing effects (which may be necessary for getting a good selection, or for cutting and pasting, or for operating pixel-by-pixel at a high zoom level), use the Pencil tool, which makes all brushes perfectly hard and disables sub-pixel anti-aliasing.

You can clone from any drawable (that is, any layer, layer mask, or channel) to any other drawable. You can even clone to or from the selection mask, by switching to QuickMask mode. If this means copying colors that the target does not support (for example, cloning from an RGB layer to an Indexed layer or a layer mask), then the colors will be converted to the closest possible approximations.

Pattern
Clicking on the pattern symbol brings up the Patterns dialog, which you can use to select the pattern to paint with. This option is only relevant if you are cloning from a Pattern source.
The Alignment mode defines the relation between the brush position and the source position.
In the following examples, we will use a source image where the sample to be cloned will be taken, and a destination image where the sample will be cloned (it could be a layer in the source image)
Original images for clone alignment
We will use the largest brush with the Pencil tool. The source is represented here with a ringed cross.
An image with a solid background only. We shall draw three cloning strokes successively.
In this mode, each brushstroke is treated separately. For each stroke, the point where you first click is copied from the source origin; there is no relationship between one brush stroke and another. In non-aligned mode, different brush strokes will usually clash if they intersect each other.
Example below: At every new brush stroke, the source goes back to its first position. The same sample is always cloned.

Aligned
In this mode, the first click you make when painting sets the offset between the source origin and the cloned result, and all subsequent brushstrokes use the same offset. Thus, you can use as many brushstrokes as you like, and they will all mesh smoothly with one another.
If you want to change the offset, select a new source origin by clicking with the
In the example below, at every new brush stroke, the source keeps the same offset it had with the previous brush stroke. So, there is no cloning offset for the first brush stroke. Here, for the following strokes, the source ends up out of the source image canvas; hence the truncated aspect.

Registered
The
At every brush stroke, the source adopts the position of the mouse pointer in the destination layer. In the following example, the destination layer is smaller than the source layer; so, there is no truncated aspect.

Fixed
Using this mode you will paint with the source origin, unlike the modes
See that the source remains fixed. The same small sample is reproduced identically in a tightened way:

The effects of the Clone tool on transparency are a bit complicated. You cannot clone transparency: if you try to clone from a transparent source, nothing happens to the target. If you clone from a partially transparent source, the effect is weighted by the opacity of the source. So, assuming 100% opacity and a hard brush:
Cloning translucent black onto white produces gray.

When you fill objects in a transparent layer (such as letters in a text layer) with a different color than before, you may find that a border of the old color still surrounds the objects. This is due to a low fill-threshold in the Bucket Fill options dialog. With a low threshold, the bucket tool won't fill semi-transparent pixels, and they will stand out against the fill because they have kept their original color.

Affected Area
Fill whole selection
This option makes GIMP fill a pre-existent selection or the whole image. A quicker approach to do the same thing could be to click and drag the foreground, background or pattern color, leaving it onto the selection.
Fill similar colors
This is the default setting: the tool fills the area with a color near the pixel onto you have clicked. The color similarity is defined by a brightness threshold, that you can set by a value or by a cursor position.

Image 1: Fill By = Composite. We successively clicked in the three color strips. Every strip is filled according to the threshold.
Image 2: Fill By = Red. We clicked in the red strip. The tool searches for contiguous pixels which have a similar value in the red channel, according to the set threshold. Only a narrow area corresponds to these standards. In the green and the blue strip, the value of pixels in the red channel is 0, very much different from the red channel value of the clicked pixel: the color doesn't spread to them.
Image 3: Fill By = Red. We clicked in the green strip. There, the value of the clicked pixel in the red channel is 0. All pixels in the green and the blue strips have the same red channel value (0): they are all painted.

The Pencil is the crudest of the tools in this group: it makes hard, non-anti-aliased brushstrokes. The Paintbrush is intermediate: it is probably the most commonly used of the group. The Airbrush is the most flexible and controllable. This flexibility also makes it a bit more difficult to use than the Paintbrush, however.
All of these tools share the same brushes, and the same options for choosing colors, either from the basic palette or from a gradient. All are capable of painting in a wide variety of modes.

Blend
Tool
The Blend tool in Toolbox
This tool fills the selected area with a gradient blend of the foreground and background colors by default, but there are many options. To make a blend, drag the cursor in the direction you want the gradient to go, and release the mouse button when you feel you have the right position and size of your blend. The softness of the blend depends on how far you drag the cursor. The shorter the drag distance, the sharper it will be.
There are an astonishing number of things you can do with this tool, and the possibilities may seem a bit overwhelming at first. The two most important options you have are the Gradient and the Shape. Clicking the Gradient button in the tool options brings up a Gradient Select window, allowing you to choose from among a variety of gradients supplied with GIMP; you can also construct and save custom gradients. Further information about gradients can be found in
For Shape, there are 11 options: Linear, Bilinear, Radial, Square, Conical (symmetric), Conical (asymmetric), Shaped (angular), Shaped (spherical), Shaped (dimpled), Spiral (clockwise), and Spiral (counterclockwise); these are described in detail below. The Shaped options are the most interesting: they cause the gradient to follow the shape of the selection boundary, no matter how twisty it is. Unlike the other shapes, Shaped gradients are not affected by the length or direction of the line you draw: for them as well as every other type of gradient you are required to click inside the selection and move the mouse, but a Shaped appears the same no matter where you click or how you move.
Check out the Difference option in the Mode menu, where doing the same thing (even with full opacity) will result in fantastic swirling patterns, changing and adding every time you drag the cursor.

Radial
This gradient begins with the foreground color at the starting point of the drawn line and transitions linearly to the background color at the ending point.
This shape proceeds in both directions from the starting point, for a distance determined by the length of the drawn line. It is useful, for example, for giving the appearance of a cylinder.
This gradient gives a circle, with foreground color at the center and background color outside the circle. It gives the appearance of a sphere without directional lighting.
