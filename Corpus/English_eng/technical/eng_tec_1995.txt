Recognising Names as Addressing
You can use cells with text to refer to the rows or to the columns that contain the cells.
Example spreadsheet
'Column One'
in a formula to refer to the cell range
B3
to
B5
, or
'Column Two'
for the cell range
C2
to
C5
.
You can also use
'Row One'
for the cell range
B3
to
D3
, or
'Row Two'
for the cell range
B4
to
D4
.
The result of a formula that uses a cell name, for example,
SUM('Column One')
, is 600.
