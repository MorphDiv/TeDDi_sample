Solaris mode for CPU percentage
If TRUE, system-monitor operates in 'Solaris mode' where a task's CPU usage is divided by the total number of CPUs. Otherwise, it operates in 'Irix mode'.
Show CPU chart as stacked area chart
If TRUE, system-monitor shows the CPU chart as a stacked area chart instead of a line chart.

Cannot change the priority of process with PID %d to %d.
%s
Cannot kill process with PID %d with signal %d.
%s
Kill the selected process “%s” (PID: %u)?
Killing a process may destroy data, break the session or introduce a security risk. Only unresponsive processes should be killed.
End the selected process “%s” (PID: %u)?
Ending a process may destroy data, break the session or introduce a security risk. Only unresponsive processes should be ended.
Change Priority of Process “%s” (PID: %u)
Note:
The priority of a process is given by its nice value. A lower nice value corresponds to a higher priority.
