Display information on this GNOME version
GNOME also includes a complete development platform for applications programmers, allowing the creation of powerful and complex applications.
GNOME includes most of what you see on your computer, including the file manager, web browser, menus, and many applications.
GNOME is a Free, usable, stable, accessible desktop environment for the Unix-like family of operating systems.
GNOME's focus on usability and accessibility, regular release cycle, and strong corporate backing make it unique among Free Software desktops.
GNOME's greatest strength is our strong community. Virtually anyone, with or without coding skills, can contribute to making GNOME better.
Hundreds of people have contributed code to GNOME since it was started in 1997; many more have contributed in other important ways, including translations, documentation, and quality assurance.
