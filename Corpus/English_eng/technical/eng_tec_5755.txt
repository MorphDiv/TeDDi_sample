Start Tutorial

The tutorial is a fast, user friendly and interactive way to learn the rules of the game. Start it if you do not know them!
New Sandbox Game
Start a new sandbox game
In a sandbox game, the solution is displayed at the beginning of the game. This is useful to understand the game principles. However: after a while, it is not really fun and you should try to start a real game!
Done!
First, you have to place all the balls on the black box. To guess the correct positions of the balls and see how they interact with laser beams, you should use the lasers that are positioned around the black box. When you think you are done, you should click here. Note that it is only possible to click here if you have placed the correct number of balls.
Give up the game
Choose "Solve" if you want to give up the current game. The solution will be displayed. If you placed all the balls and do not want to give up, choose "Done!".

Clicking on "Done!" is the normal way to check the positions of the balls at the end of the game. However, it is not possible in the tutorial to end the game before you reached the last step. Please first finish the tutorial.
Check positions
Your final score is: %1. You did really well!
But it does not count because it is the sandbox!
Your final score is: %1. I guess you need more practise.
Game paused. Press "%1" to resume.
Do you want to cancel the current custom game and start a new one with the new parameters?

Custom Game
Sorry, you may not give up during the tutorial.
Solve
You placed all the balls. Great! You should now click on "Done!" & #160; to end the game and check if you guessed correctly. So, do you really want to give up this game?
Give up
Do you really want to give up this game?
Note: In the sandbox mode, the solution is already displayed. Have fun!
This will be the end of the current game!
Score
This is your score. You should try to get the lowest possible. The score increases: with time: 1 point per second. with the use of lasers: 3 points if the laser beam hits a ball or exits at the entry point, 9 points if it exits at another entry point. Your score is set to 999 at the end of the game if you make a mistake.
This is the main game area. The black box is in the center. On the left, there are the balls you have to place over the black box. Around the black box, there are lasers that are replaced with interaction information if you use them.

Welcome!
This tutorial will teach you how to play KBlackBox, using a simple example. We are playing with a square black box of 6 columns and 6 rows. It has 3 balls hidden inside it and 24 laser probes around it. The goal is to find the positions of the balls.
Click on "Next"
Black box principles
The balls are not visible, but we can shoot laser beams into the box at different entry points and observe if the laser beams leave the box, and if they do, where they come out. The laser beams interact with the balls in various ways.
Please click on the marked laser to shoot a beam into the black box.
No interaction
If a laser beam does not interact with any ball in the black box, it comes out at the point opposite the entry point. Example: Suppose we have 3 balls in the box as shown. They will not affect laser beam "1". As the game progresses, each pair of entry/ exit points is marked with a different number.
Now shoot the marked laser to discover the first kind of interaction.
Hit
A direct impact on a ball is called a "hit". A beam that hits a ball does not emerge from the black box. Example: The beam might have hit a ball at the position shown, but the exact position of the hit is not certain: There are many other possibilities.
Shoot the marked laser to discover the second kind of interaction.
Simple deflection
The interaction of a beam that does not actually hit a ball, but aims to one side of it, is called a "deflection". The angle of deflection of the beam is always 90 degrees. Example: The ball shown would deflect beam "2" upward, as shown, but this is not the only possibility.
Click on "Next" to see another combination of ball positions that deflects the laser beam as shown.
Several deflections
As you can see, interactions in the black box can be quite complicated! A laser beam entering and exiting at the positions "2" might have been deflected by this configuration of 3 balls.
Shoot the marked laser to discover another kind of result.
Reflection
If the laser beam leaves the black box at the entry point, it has been reflected backward inside the black box. Example: We have placed 2 balls for you in a configuration that would lead to such a reflection.
Shoot the marked laser to see another backward reflection case.
Special reflection
If a ball is at the edge of the box (with no other ball nearby), a beam which is aimed into the black box directly beside it causes a backward reflection. Example: The configuration shown can cause a backward reflection.
Nearly done. Click on "Next".
Marker for "free position"
We are sure there are no balls in the first 2 columns. If there were any, the beam entering at position "1" would hit a ball or be deflected by a ball in column 2. You can mark a "free position" with a right mouse click (see also keyboard shortcuts). Example: There are 12 markers in the first 2 columns.
Click on "Next".
Marking balls
When you have worked out where a ball is, please use the left mouse button to mark it. To remove a ball mark, use the left mouse button again. Last tip: If you are not sure about a position, you can use a right click on a ball to mark it as "unsure". (See also keyboard shortcuts.) Example: We marked one position as sure, the other one as unsure.
Let us play!
Congratulations! You now know all the rules for KBlackBox. You can start to play. Try to finish this tutorial game by yourself! Tip: We have sent in enough beams to deduce the positions of the 3 balls with certainty. Of course, you can use some more shots if needed.
Finish placing the balls and click on "Done!" when you are done!
