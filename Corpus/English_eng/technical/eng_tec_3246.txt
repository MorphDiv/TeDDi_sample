(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
ibase_pconnect() acts very much like ibase_connect() with two major differences.
First, when connecting, the function will first try to find a (persistent) link that's already opened with the same parameters.
If one is found, an identifier for it will be returned instead of opening a new connection.
Second, the connection to the InterBase server will not be closed when the execution of the script ends.
Instead, the link will remain open for future use (ibase_close() will not close links established by ibase_pconnect()).
This type of link is therefore called 'persistent'.
It is functional only with InterBase 6 and versions higher than that.
It is functional only with InterBase 5 and versions higher than that.
See also ibase_connect() for the meaning of parameters passed to this function.
They are exactly the same.
