Type accented & letters
If this is checked, you have to type accented letters yourself (i.e. they are differentiated from the corresponding unaccented letter).
If this is disabled, the selected language does not support it. If this is enabledand if you check it, then you should type accented letters on their own. If it is not checked, accented letters will be displayed with normal letters (default). For example, in Catalan, if this is unchecked and you type "o", the o and ò will be displayed in the word xenofòbia. If this option is checked, when you type "o", only "o" will be displayed and you will have to type "ò" for this letter to be displayed.
German
Play in upper case letters
If checked, the word will be displayed all in upper case letters
If this is checked, the word will be displayed in upper case letters, even if you enter them in lower case. If this is unchecked (default), the word will be in lower case. This setting is currently only available for the German language.
Here you can choose settings for all languages.
Check this if you do not want to discover each instance of the same letter.
If you check this box, only the first letter will be written if the letter is found in several places in the word. Then you have to rechoose the same letter, to replace the second instance in the word until there are no more instances of this letter. For example, the word to guess is "potato". If this option is unchecked, when you try "o", the two instances of "o" in the word will be discovered at the same time. If this is checked, you will need to try "o" twice. Default is that for one letter typed, all instances of that letter in the word are discovered.
