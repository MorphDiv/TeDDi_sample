You are saving a file with many images, which causes Tellico to slow down significantly. Do you want to save the images separately in Tellico's data directory to improve performance? Your choice can always be changed in the configuration dialog.

... that if a book has more than one author, you should separate their names by a semi-colon, so that Tellico will know how to split them and use them separately. Any other field which allows multiple values should be entered the same way, with a semi-colon (;) separating each value.
... that you can change which fields are shown in the list view by right-clicking on the column header.
... that you can add, edit, or modify the fields in the collection using the Field Editor. The arrow buttons below the field list can be used to change the position of the field in the list, which affects the placement in the entry editor.
... that if you want to filter by a Checkbox field, a value of "true" should be used. If you'd like to filter to show only the science fiction books which you've not read, for example, check the Match all of the following button, set the first rule to have "Genre" "contains" "Science Fiction" (no quotes) and the second rule to have "Read" "does not contain" "true" (no quotes).
... that if a non-word character is used in the Quick Filter, the text is interpreted as a regular expression. To show only books which are by Weber or Bujold, for example, then type "weber|bujold" (no quotes) in the filter box.
... that you can edit more than one entry at a time, by holding down the Shift or Ctrl key and selecting multiple entries.
... that you can convert an existing book collection to a bibliography, which can then be exported to bibtex or Bibtexml format.
... that you can add, edit, and delete string macros for bibliographies.
... that if more than one field is formatted as a name, then an additional group named "People" is added to the collection, allowing authors and editors to be sorted or printed together, for example.
... that you can modify the appearance of the printed output by modifying the tellico-printing. xsl file. The file generates HTML, and the CSS within the stylesheet governs things like the font, the margins, etc.
... that you can import using any generic XSL stylesheet which outputs a valid Tellico XML file.
... that double-clicking an entry item opens the Entry Editor.
... that you can add HTML tags to any Paragraph field for formatting, such as & lt; bgt; boldlt; /bgt; or & lt; igt; italiclt; /igt;.
... that in the Detailed View, you can press a letter on the keyboard to skip to the next entry that starts with that letter.
... that you can use a field with a derived value to combine multiple separated fields into a single field. Use a derived value template similar to "Value: %{fielda}%{fieldb}" where %{...} gets replaced with the appropriate field value. This is useful to collect multiple values in a single field, e. g. for better grouping, and to combine fields of different types by respecting proper sorting at the same time. Consider for example a number field followed by a text subfield with entries 3b, 14a.
