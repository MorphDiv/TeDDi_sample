Block Devices
The module window displays the available file devices and some information about each device. It also allows you to control mount points, and mount/ unmount devices.
Normally, the following pieces of information are shown in this tab:
an icon depicting the type of storage
device name
file system type
total size
mount point
free disk space
the percentage of space used as a number and as a graph.
Left clicking on the header of a particular column sorts the devices according to that variable. A second left click sorts in the opposite order.
Right clicking on a row pops up a menu. If that device is not currently mounted, the Mount Device option is available. If the device is mounted, it can be unmounted by choosing Unmount Device. Selecting Open in File Manager opens a new window with a graphical view of the files on that device.
The appropriate mount and unmount commands, and how the file manager is opened from the context menu, can be configured from the & kdiskfree; application.
