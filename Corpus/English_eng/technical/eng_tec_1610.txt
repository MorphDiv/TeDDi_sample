Controlling Program Execution
The following statements control the execution of a program.
A program generally executes from the first line of code to the last line of code.
You can also execute certain procedures within the program according to specific conditions, or repeat a section of the program within a sub-procedure or function.
You can use loops to repeat parts of a program as many times as necessary, or until a certain condition is met.
These type of control statements are classified as Condition, Loop, or Jump statements.
