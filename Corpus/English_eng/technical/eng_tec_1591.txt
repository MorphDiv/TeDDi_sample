Tan function
Tan Function [Run-time]
Determines the tangent of an angle.
The angle is specified in radians.
Using the angle Alpha, the Tan Function calculates the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle in a right-angled triangle.
Tan(Alpha) = side opposite the angle/side adjacent to angle
Syntax:
Tan (Number)
Return value:
Double
Parameters:
Number:
A numerical expression that specifies an angle in radians for which you want to calculate the tanget.
To convert degrees to radians, multiply by Pi/180.
To convert radians to degrees, multiply by 180/Pi.
degrees=(radians*180)/Pi
radians=(degrees*Pi)/180
Pi is here the fixed circle constant with the rounded value 3.1415926...
Example:
REM In this example, the following entry is possible for a right-angled triangle:
REM The side opposite the angle and the angle (in degrees) to calculate the length of the side adjacent to the angle:
Sub ExampleTangent
REM Pi = 3.1415926... is a predefined variable
Dim d1 as Double
Dim dAlpha as Double
d1 = InputBox$ ( &quot; Enter the length of the side opposite the angle: &quot; , &quot; opposite &quot; )
dAlpha = InputBox$ ( &quot; Enter the Alpha angle (in degrees): &quot; , &quot; Alpha &quot; )
Print &quot; the length of the side adjacent the angle is &quot; ; (d1 / tan (dAlpha * Pi / 180))
End Sub
