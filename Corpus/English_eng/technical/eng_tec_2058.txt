Defining Number of Pages for Printing
If a sheet is too large for a single printed page, $[officename] Calc will print the current sheet evenly divided over several pages.
Since the automatic page break does not always take place in the optimal position, you can define the page distribution yourself.
Go to the sheet to be printed.
View - Page Break Preview
.
You will see the automatic distribution of the sheet across the print pages.
The automatically created print ranges are indicated by dark blue lines, and the user-defined ones by light blue lines.
The page breaks (line breaks and column breaks) are marked as black lines.
You can move the blue lines with the mouse.
You will find further options in the Context menu, including adding an additional print range, removing the scaling and inserting additional manual line and column breaks.
