This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP on Solaris systems.
Solaris installs often lack C compilers and their related tools.
The required software is as follows:
gcc (recommended, other C compilers may work)
make
flex
bison
m4
autoconf
automake
perl
gzip
tar
GNU sed
You can simplify the Solaris install process by using pkgadd to install most of your needed components.
