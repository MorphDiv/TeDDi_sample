BookMan: Organize your Bookmarks
Bookmarks
BookMan is & krusader; 's Bookmark tool for bookmarking folders, local- and remote URL's, and later returning to them in a click of a button. The Bookman menu is divided into four sections:
Your personal bookmarks
Popular & URL; 's
Permanent bookmarks
Manage bookmarks
You can bookmark inside a remote file system (FTP; or SAMBA) and later use the bookmark to quickly connect to the remote machine, but you cannot bookmark inside an archive.

Using Bookmarks
Usually, you click on the Bookmark button when you are in the target folder. For example, to bookmark / usr/ tmp, navigate & krusader; there and click the Bookmark button and select Bookmark Current. When the Bookmark Current dialog box appears, the & URL; line will say / usr/ tmp. Name is for the name you would like to give to the bookmark (e. g.: temporary folder). Hotkeys are supported by adding amp; to the bookmark name e. g. amp; sourceforge, & home, downamp; loads & etc;, so you can quickly call the bookmark name with Alt; foo. If you add the bookmark without entering a name, the bookmarks name will be the same as its target. URL is where the bookmark points to. Create in creates bookmark folders for organizing your bookmarks.
To use your bookmarks, click the Bookmark button and choose a bookmark. You may also use the Key-Bindings: Ctrl; Shift; D to bookmark the current item, Alt; right/ left arrow to open right/ left panel bookmarks list and Ctrl; D to open the bookmarks of the active panel. A Middle Mouse Button click on bookmarks opens them in a new Folder tab.
Navigation in bookmarks:
Start typing letters
e. g. when you type'h 'and only one bookmark starts with'h', it is executed immediately - no enter needed
If more than one bookmarks begins with'h ', you will have to continue adding letters, until you have specified enough and again, the bookmark is executed.
Password handling
One of the benefits of the bookmark manager is that the passwords are saved using & kde; 's services - where e. g. your & konqueror; /kmail; password are saved. If you have a wallet, & kde; will save the passwords there. By clicking the bookmarks, a dialog will open and ask for your username and password. Supply them and click'save password '. The passwords and usernames will be saved securely by & kde; 's wallet (make sure it is enabled by your distro). The downside here is that if you reinstall and do not backup your passwords from the wallet as well as & krusader; 's bookmark file, something will be lost.
Popular URL's
Popular URL's
The submenu Popular URL's holds persistent the most popular visited & URL; 's (local or remote). This submenu displays the top 15 popular URLs, sorted by ranking, so that the top & URL; is the most popular. This is easy for when you need to visit & URL; s often, but do not want to create Bookmarks, it serves as a temporary bookmark list for the most visited links. Quicksearch Popular URL's is a fast way to browse/ select the popular & URL; s:
Open the Popular URL's or use Ctrl; Z
Type a few letters to narrow the search
Press enter (you will go to the & URL; list)
Press enter again and the panel is refreshed
Permanent bookmarks
These are hardcoded bookmarks to the top bookmark menu; there is no need for them to be saved to the file. With the Context Menu you can enable/ disable these permanent bookmarks. The following permanent bookmarks are available:
Media uses & kde; 's Media protocol media: /
Local Network uses & kde; 's lan: / protocol.
Virtual Filesystem Virtual file systems (VFS) virt: / is not a virtual folder, but a container for & URL; 's from different file systems. It is used for e. g. the Feed to Listbox feature of the search module and the synchronizer. The location toolbar will display e. g. virt: / Search results 1 or virt: / Synchronise results 1.
Jump back or Ctrl; J brings you back to your starting position when you did create a new tab in the panel window. This feature is very handy if you go deep into a directory tree, then you can return with one action to the starting point. With Set jump back point here or & Ctrl; Shift; J sets the current directory as a jump back point.
Manage bookmarks
To edit and organize your bookmarks, by clicking the Bookmark button and selecting the Manage Bookmarks, KeditBookmarks will be displayed. This is where you can edit/ remove and rearrange the bookmarks. KeditBookmarks (part of the kdebase package) is a bookmark editor for & konqueror;, & krusader; and other applications, which use the XBEL standard for the bookmark format. The bookmarks are stored in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ krusader/ krbookmarks. xml.
You can import bookmarks from IE, Opera, Galeon, & kde;, Mozilla, & Netscape;. KeditBookmarks is easy to use, however, if you need more information, please read the KeditBookmarks or the & konqueror; handbook.
