Do not use in animals suffering from gastrointestinal disorders such as irritation and haemorrhage, impaired hepatic, cardiac or renal function and haemorrhagic disorders.
Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients Do not use in dogs less than 6 weeks of age.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
If adverse reactions occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of renal toxicity.
2/ 48 Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
People with known hypersensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Typical adverse reactions of NSAIDs such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, faecal occult blood, apathy and renal failure have occasionally been reported.
These adverse reactions occur generally within the first treatment week and are in most cases transient and disappear following termination of the treatment but in very rare cases may be serious or fatal.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3).
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Loxicom must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such veterinary medicinal products should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Oral use.
To be administered with food or directly into the mouth.
Shake well before use.
Initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight (i. e.
4 ml/ 10 kg bodyweight) on the first day.
Treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration (at 24 hour intervals) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight (i. e.
2 ml/ 10 kg bodyweight).
For longer term treatment, once clinical response has been observed (after ≥ 4 days), the dose can be adjusted to the lowest effective individual dose reflecting that the degree of pain and inflammation associated with chronic musculo-skeletal disorders may vary over time.
Particular care should be taken with regard to the accuracy of dosing.
The suspension can be given using either of the two measuring syringes provided in the package.
The syringes fit onto the bottle and have a kg-bodyweight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose (i. e.
0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight).
Thus for the first day, twice the maintenance volume will be required.
Alternatively therapy may be initiated with Loxicom 5 mg/ ml solution for injection.
A clinical response is normally seen within 3-4 days.
Treatment should be discontinued after 10 days at the latest if no clinical improvement is apparent.
Avoid introduction of contamination during use.
3/ 48 4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
In the case of overdose, symptomatic treatment should be initiated.
4.11 Withdrawal period
Not applicable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic Group:
Anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products, non-steroids (oxicams).
ATCvet code:
QM01AC06
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class which acts by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-exudative and antipyretic effects.
It reduces leukocyte infiltration into the inflamed tissue.
To a minor extent it also inhibits collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation.
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that meloxicam inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to a greater extent than cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1).
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
Absorption Meloxicam is completely absorbed following oral administration and maximal plasma concentrations are obtained after approximately 4.5 hours.
When the product is used according to the recommended dosage regime, steady state concentrations of meloxicam in plasma are reached on the second day of treatment.
Distribution There is a linear relationship between the dose administered and plasma concentration observed in the therapeutic dose range.
Approximately 97% of meloxicam is bound to plasma proteins.
The volume of distribution is 0.3 l/ kg.
Metabolism Meloxicam is predominantly found in plasma and is also a major biliary excretion product whereas urine contains only traces of the parent compound.
Meloxicam is metabolised to an alcohol, an acid derivative and to several polar metabolites.
All major metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically inactive.
Elimination Meloxicam is eliminated with a half-life of 24 hours.
Approximately 75% of the administered dose is eliminated via faeces and the remainder via urine.

12/ 48 4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
If adverse reactions occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of renal toxicity.
Do not use an oral follow-up therapy containing meloxicam or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in cats, as no safe dosage for repeated oral administration has been established.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Accidental self-injection may give rise to pain.
People with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental self-injection, seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Typical adverse reactions of NSAIDs such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, faecal occult blood, apathy and renal failure have occasionally been reported.
In dogs, these adverse reactions occur generally within the first treatment week and are in most cases transient and disappear following termination of the treatment but in very rare cases may be serious or fatal.
In very rare cases anaphylactoid reactions may occur and should be treated symptomatically.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
The safety of the veterinary medicinal product has not been established during pregnancy and lactation (see section 4.3).
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Loxicom must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Concurrent administration of potential nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.
In animals at anaesthetic risk (e. g. aged animals) intravenous or subcutaneous fluid therapy during anaesthesia should be taken into consideration.
When anaesthesia and NSAID are concomitantly administered, a risk for renal function cannot be excluded.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Dogs:
Musculo-skeletal disorders:
Single subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight (i. e.
0.4 ml/ 10 kg bodyweight).
Loxicom 1.5 mg/ ml oral suspension and Loxicom 0.5 mg/ ml oral suspension may be used for continuation of treatment at a dosage of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight, 24 hours after administration of the injection.
13/ 48 Reduction of post-operative pain (over a period of 24 hours):
Single intravenous or subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight (i. e.
0.4 ml/ 10 kg bodyweight) before surgery, for example at the time of induction of anaesthesia.
Cats:
Reduction of post-operative pain:
Single subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 0.3 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight (i. e.
0.06 ml/ kg bodyweight) before surgery, for example at the time of induction of anaesthesia.

DOSAGE FOR EACH SPECIES, ROUTE(S) AND METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION
Dosage:
Initial treatment is a single dose of 0.2 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight (i. e.
4 ml/ 10 kg bodyweight) on the first day.
Treatment is to be continued once daily by oral administration (at 24 hour intervals) at a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight (i. e.
2 ml/ 10 kg bodyweight).
For longer term treatment, once clinical response has been observed (after ≥ 4 days), the dose can be adjusted to the lowest effective individual dose reflecting that the degree of pain and inflammation associated with chronic musculo-skeletal disorders may vary over time.
Method and route of administration:
Oral use.
To be administered with food or directly into the mouth.
Shake well before use.
The suspension can be given using either of the two measuring syringes provided in the package.
The syringes fit onto the bottle and have a kg-bodyweight scale which corresponds to the maintenance dose (i. e.
0.1 mg meloxicam/ kg bodyweight).
Thus for initiation of the therapy on the first day, twice the maintenance volume will be required.
Alternatively therapy may be initiated with Loxicom 5 mg/ ml solution for injection.
A clinical response is normally seen within 3-4 days.
Treatment should be discontinued after 10 days at the latest if no clinical improvement is apparent.
Avoid introduction of contamination during use.
9.
ADVICE ON CORRECT ADMINISTRATION
Particular care should be taken with regard to the accuracy of dosing.
Please carefully follow the instructions of the veterinarian.
10.
WITHDRAWAL PERIOD
Not applicable.
38/ 48 11.
SPECIAL STORAGE PRECAUTIONS
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
This veterinary medicinal product does not require any special storage conditions.
Shelf-life after first opening the container:
6 months.
Do not use after the expiry date stated on the carton and the bottle.
12.
SPECIAL WARNINGS
Precautions for use in animals
If adverse reactions occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of renal toxicity.
Interactions
Other NSAIDs, diuretics, anticoagulants, aminoglycoside antibiotics and substances with high protein binding may compete for binding and thus lead to toxic effects.
Loxicom must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such veterinary medicinal products should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Overdose
In the case of overdose, symptomatic treatment should be initiated.
Precautions to be taken by the person administering the product
People with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs should avoid contact with the veterinary medicinal product.
In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical advice immediately and show this package leaflet or the label to the physician.
13.
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF UNUSED PRODUCT OR WASTE MATERIALS, IF ANY
Medicines should not be disposed of via waste water or household waste.
Ask your veterinary surgeon how to dispose of medicines no longer required.

SPECIAL WARNING(S)
For post-operative pain relief in cats, safety has only been documented after thiopental/ halothane anaesthesia.
Precautions for use in animals
If adverse effects occur, treatment should be discontinued and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought.
Avoid use in any dehydrated, hypovolaemic or hypotensive animal, as there is a potential risk of increased renal toxicity.
Do not use an oral follow-up therapy containing meloxicam or other NSAIDs in cats, as no safe dosage for repeated oral administration has been established.
Interactions

Loxicom must not be administered in conjunction with other NSAIDs or glucocorticosteroids.
Concurrent administration of potential nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided.
In animals at anaesthetic risk (e. g. aged animals) intravenous or subcutaneous fluid therapy during anaesthesia should be taken into consideration.
When anaesthesia and NSAID are concomitantly administered, a risk for renal function cannot be excluded.
Pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory substances may result in additional or increased adverse effects and accordingly a treatment-free period with such drugs should be observed for at least 24 hours before commencement of treatment.
The treatment-free period, however, should take into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the products used previously.
Overdose
