The Zenith
Zenith
Horizontal Coordinates
The Zenith is the point in the sky where you are looking when you look straight up from the ground. More precisely, it is the point on the sky with an Altitude of +90 Degrees; it is the Pole of the Horizontal Coordinate System. Geometrically, it is the point on the Celestial Sphere intersected by a line drawn from the center of the Earth through your location on the Earth's surface.
The Zenith is, by definition, a point along the Local Meridian.
Exercise:
You can point to the Zenith by pressing Z or by selecting Zenith from the Location menu.
