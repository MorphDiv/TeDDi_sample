There can be some questions we can 't put into other categories.
Here you can find them.
1.
Where did the pop-ups go on the website?
Can I have the code for that?
The yellow pop-up windows on the old site were pretty cool, but were very difficult to maintain (since some companies seem to enjoy changing the way their browsers work with every new release).
All the code for previous versions of the website is still available through CVS.
Specifically, the last version of shared.inc (that had all the Javascript and DHTML to do the popups) is available here.
2.
How can I handle the bz2 compressed manuals on Windows?
If you don' t have an archiver-tool to handle bz2 files download the commandline tool from Redhat (please find further information below).
If you would not like to use a command line tool, you can try free tools like Stuffit Expander, UltimateZip, 7-Zip, or Quick Zip.
If you have tools like WinRAR or Power Archiver, you can easily decompress the bz2 files with it.
If you use Windows Commander, a bz2 plugin for that program is available freely from the Windows Commander site.
The bzip2 commandline tool from Redhat:
Win2k Sp2 users grab the latest version 1.0.2, all other Windows user should grab version 1.00.
After downloading rename the executable to bzip2.exe.
For convenience put it into a directory in your path, e.g.
C:\Windows where C represents your windows installation drive.
Note: lang stands for your language and x for the desired format, e.g.: pdf.
To uncompress the php_manual_lang.x.bz2 follow these simple instructions:
open a command prompt window
cd to the folder where you stored the downloaded php_manual_lang.x.bz2
invoke bzip2 -d php_manual_lang.x.bz2, extracting php_manual_lang.x in the same folder
In case you downloaded the php_manual_lang.tar.bz2 with many html-files in it, the procedure is the same.
The only difference is that you got a file php_manual_lang.tar.
The tar format is known to be treated with most common archivers on Windows like e.g.
WinZip.
