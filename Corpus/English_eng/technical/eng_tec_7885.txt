7.5 micrograms**
* propagated in Vero cells (continuous cell line of ** expressed in micrograms haemagglutinin.
mammalian origin)
This vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic.
This is a multidose container.
See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Suspension for injection.
The vaccine is an off-white, opalescent, translucent suspension.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.
Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with official guidance.
CELVAPAN has been evaluated in adults 18-59 years of age and in elderly 60 years of age and above.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Adults: first dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.
A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least 3 weeks.
There is no data on CELVAPAN vaccination dose and schedule for subjects under 18 years old and for subjects with co-morbidities (e. g. immunosuppressed subjects).
In a pandemic situation administration of the vaccine in those populations shall follow national recommendations.
For further information, see section 5.1.
Immunization should be carried out by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle.
2 4.3 Contraindications
History of an anaphylactic (i. e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (e. g. formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) of this vaccine.
However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine, provided that facilities for resuscitation are immediately available in case of need.
See section 4.4.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance(s), to any of the excipients and to trace residues e. g. formaldehyde, benzonase, or sucrose.
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.
If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection.
CELVAPAN should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly.
There are no data with CELVAPAN using the subcutaneous route.
Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings.
Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.
A protective response may not be induced in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
CELVAPAN should not be given at the same time as other vaccines.
However, if co-administration with another vaccine is indicated, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs.
It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified.
Immunoglobulin is not to be given with CELVAPAN.
If it is necessary to provide immediate protection, CELVAPAN may be given at the same time as normal or specific immunoglobulin.
Injections of CELVAPAN and immunoglobulin should be made into separate limbs.
The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment.
Following influenza vaccination, false positive results in serology tests using the ELISA method to detect antibodies against HIV1, Hepatitis C and especially HTLV1 have been observed.
The Western Blot technique disproves the results.
The transient false positive reactions could be due to the IgM response by the vaccine.
3 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Data from vaccinations with interpandemic trivalent vaccines in pregnant women do not indicate that adverse foetal and maternal outcomes were attributable to the vaccine.
Therefore, for pregnant women, administration of the pandemic influenza vaccine is recommended, irrespective of their stage of pregnancy.
The vaccine CELVAPAN may be used during lactation.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Some undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 such as dizziness and vertigo may affect the ability to drive or use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
In clinical trials with the mock-up vaccine (see section 5.1) in 606 subjects (326 between 18 and 59 years old, and 280 aged 60 and above), the following adverse reactions were assessed as at least possibly related by the investigator.
Most of the reactions were mild in nature, of short duration and qualitatively similar to those induced by influenza vaccines.
There were fewer reactions after the second dose of the vaccine compared with the first dose.
The most frequently occurring adverse reaction was injection site pain, which was usually mild.
Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency.
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01
This section describes the clinical experience with the mock-up vaccine following a two-dose administration.
Mock-up vaccines contain influenza antigens that are different from those in the currently circulating influenza viruses.
These antigens can be considered as ‘ novel’ antigens and simulate a situation where the target population for vaccination is immunologically naïve.
Data obtained with the mock-up vaccine will support a vaccination strategy that is likely to be used for the pandemic vaccine: clinical immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity data obtained with mock-up vaccines are relevant for the pandemic vaccines.
5 Immune response against the vaccine strain contained in CELVAPAN (A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004)
The immunogenicity of the 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted formulation of CELVAPAN (strain A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004) has been evaluated in two clinical studies in adults aged 18 – 59 years (N=312) and in elderly subjects aged 60 years and older (N=272) following a 0, 21 day schedule.
After primary vaccination the seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate and seroconversion factor for anti-HA antibody as measured by single radial haemolysis (SRH) in adults aged 18 to 59 years and in elderly subjects aged 60 years and above were as follows:

Antibody Persistence and Booster Vaccination with Homologous and Heterologous Vaccine Strains
Antibody persistence after vaccination with the 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted formulation of CELVAPAN (strain A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004) has been evaluated in two clinical studies in adults aged 18 – 59 years (N=285) and in one clinical study in elderly subjects aged 60 years and above (N=258) up to 6 months after the start of the primary vaccination series.
The results indicate an overall decline in antibody levels over time.
Data on later time points (months 12 and 24) are not yet available.

To date a booster vaccination with homologous and heterologous vaccine strains has been administered in the phase 3 study 6 months after primary vaccination with two doses of the A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 strain vaccine.
Two dose levels (3.75 µg and 7.5 µg) of both the A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 and A/ Indonesia/ 05/ 2005 strain vaccines were investigated for the booster vaccination.
Seroprotective titres as determined by SRH assay against the homologous vaccine strain (A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004) were observed in 65.5% of subjects aged 18 – 59 years and in 59.4% of subjects aged 60 years and older at 21 days after a booster vaccination with the 7.5 μ g dose of the A/ Vietnam strain vaccine.
Twenty-one days after a booster vaccination with the 7.5 μ g dose of the A/ Indonesia/ 05/ 2005 strain vaccine a cross reactive response against the A/ Vietnam strain was obtained in 69.0% of subjects aged 18 – 59 years and in 40.6% of subjects aged 60 years and older.
Antibody responses as measured by MN 21 days after the booster vaccination were generally slightly higher with the A/ Indonesia/ 05/ 2005 than with the A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 strain vaccine.
Seroneutralisation rates (MN titre > 20) at 21 days after a booster vaccination with the 7.5 µg dose of the A/ Vietnam and A/ Indonesia vaccines, tested against both the homologous and heterologous strains were as follows:

Another study investigated a booster vaccination with 7.5 μ g of the heterologous A/ Indonesia/ 05/ 2005 vaccine strain administered 12 – 15 months after an initial 2-dose priming with various dose levels of adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations of the A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 strain vaccine in subjects aged 18 – 45 years.
In subjects who received the 7.5 μ g non-adjuvanted formulation for primary vaccination (N = 12) seroprotection rates as measured by SRH 21 days after the booster vaccination were 66.7% and 83.3%, and 100% and 91.7% of subjects achieved neutralising antibody titres > 20 when tested against the homologous A/ Indonesia and the heterologous A/ Vietnam strain, respectively.
No clinical data have been generated in subjects below 18 years of age.
Information from non-clinical studies:
The protective efficacy of CELVAPAN against morbidity and mortality induced by the infection with lethal doses of highly pathogenic avian Influenza H5N1 virus was assessed non-clinically in a ferret challenge model.
Two studies have been performed using either the H5N1 A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 or the A/ Indonesia/ 05/ 2005 vaccine.
In one study, sixteen ferrets were divided into two cohorts and were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 with 7.5 µg of the A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 vaccine or were sham vaccinated.
All ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of the highly virulent H5N1 virus strain A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 and monitored for 14 days.
Ferrets vaccinated with the 7.5 µg dose of the A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 vaccine demonstrated a high rate of seroconversion.
The A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 vaccine afforded protection against homologous challenge as evidenced by full survivorship, reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, a less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of inflammation and necrosis in brain and olfactory bulb in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to control animals.
All controls animals succumbed to the infection.
In a second study, sixty-six ferrets were divided into 6 cohorts of 11 ferrets and were immunized on days 0 and 21 with 3.75 µg or 7.5 µg of the Indonesia vaccine or were sham vaccinated.
The ferrets were challenged intranasally on day 35 with a high dose of either the clade 2 H5N1 virus A/ Indonesia/ 05/ 2005 or the clade 1 H5N1 virus A/ Vietnam/ 1203/ 2004 and monitored for 14 days.
The A/ lndonesia/ 05/ 2005 vaccine was shown to be efficacious with 100% survival, reduced incidence of fever, reduced weight loss, reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological (leukopenia and lymphopenia) changes in the vaccinated cohorts following homologous challenge.
Similarly, the A/ lndonesia/ 05/ 2005 vaccine was efficacious against a heterologous challenge, showing a vaccine dose dependent survivorship in the vaccinated cohorts as compared to the control cohort.
Similar to the homologous challenge, vaccination against a heterologous challenge reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological (leukopenia) changes associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza infection.

• CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Not applicable
• OTHER CONDITIONS
Pharmacovigilance system The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in version V01 (dated June 2006) presented in Module 1.8.1. of the Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.
Risk Management Plan The MAH commits to performing the studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as agreed in version RMP V 2.0 (dated 14 Aug 2008) of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2. of the Marketing Authorisation Application and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).
11 In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted • When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities • Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached • At the request of the EMEA
PSURs PSUR submission during the influenza pandemic:
During a pandemic situation, the frequency of submission of periodic safety update reports specified in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 726/ 2004 will not be adequate for the safety monitoring of a pandemic vaccine for which high levels of exposure are expected within a short period of time.
Such situation requires rapid notification of safety information that may have the greatest implications for risk-benefit balance in a pandemic.
Prompt analysis of cumulative safety information, in light of extent of exposure, will be crucial for regulatory decisions and protection of the population to be vaccinated.
In addition, duration a pandemic, resources needed for an in-depth evaluation of Periodic Safety Update Reports in the format as defined in Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the European Union may not be adequate for a rapid identification of a new safety issue.
In consequence, as soon as the pandemic is declared (Phase 6 of the WHO global Influenza preparedness plan) and the pandemic vaccine is used, the MAH shall submit periodic safety update reports with periodicity and format defined as follows:
Frequency of submission
- The clock will start from the first Monday after shipment of the first batch of vaccine.
- First data-lock point is 14 days later.
- Report submission is no later than day 22 (i. e. the following Monday).
- Reporting to be fortnightly for the first 3 months of the pandemic.
- Periodicity will be reviewed by the MAH and the (Co-) Rapporteur at 3 monthly
intervals.
Format The report shall include the following Tables of aggregate data using the agreed templates:
1.
Fatal and/ or life-threatening reactions – for each Preferred Term (PT), including the proportion of fatal reports 2.
Adverse Events of Special Interest (PTs) 3.
Serious unexpected reactions (PTs) 4.
All events occurring in the following age groups:

All events reported by patients that have been entered into the database by data-lock point 6.
A cumulative overview of all events reported during the period, stratified according to type of reporter (patient or health care professional), seriousness, expectedness, and whether spontaneous or solicited.
Presentation of data will take into consideration the following recommendations:
- Serious expected reactions will be reviewed by the MAH as part of their signal detection
procedures and will only form part of the report if an issue of concern arises.
- All tables will be based on number of events (presented on PT level, sorted by System
Organ Class [SOC]) and not number of cases.
- Tables 1 to 4 will be based on events reported from healthcare professionals only.
- In Tables 1 to 5, numbers will be provided for events received during the reporting period
and cumulatively.
12
-
All tables will be based on generic and not product-specific data.
Product-specific data can be evaluated during signal work-up.

CELVAPAN is a vaccine used in adults of 18 years of age and older.
It is used to prevent influenza (flu) in an officially declared pandemic.
Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly to affect most countries and regions around the world.
The symptoms (signs) of pandemic flu are similar to those of an “ ordinary” flu but are usually more severe.
The vaccine works by helping the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.
2.
BEFORE YOU RECEIVE CELVAPAN
Do not use CELVAPAN:
• if you previously had a serious allergic reaction (i. e. life-threatening) to CELVAPAN. • if you are allergic to any of the ingredients or trace residues (formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) contained in the vaccine.
The active substance and other ingredients in CELVAPAN are listed in Section 6 at the end of the leaflet.
Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.
However, in a pandemic situation, your doctor may recommend to give the vaccine.
Take special care with CELVAPAN:
You should tell your doctor before vaccination • if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C).
If this applies to you then your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better.
A minor infection such as a cold should not be problem, but your doctor should advise whether you could still be vaccinated with CELVAPAN. • if you have a poor immune response (as for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, e. g. corticosteroid treatments or chemotherapy for cancer);
20 • if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses.
In the first few weeks after vaccination with CELVAPAN the results of these tests may not be correct.
Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently received CELVAPAN; • If you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.
There is no information on the use of CELVAPAN below 18 years of age.
In case of pandemic national recommendations will be followed.
Taking other medicines: • Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently received any other vaccine. • CELVAPAN should not be given at the same time as other vaccines.
However, if this cannot be avoided, the other vaccine should be injected into the other limb.
You should be aware that the side effects may be intensified. • If you take any medicines that reduce immunity to infections or have any other type of treatment (such as radiotherapy) that affects the immune system, CELVAPAN can still be given but your response to the vaccine may be poor. • CELVAPAN should not be given at the same time as immunoglobulins.
However, if this cannot be avoided, the immunoglobulins should be injected into the other limb.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding.
Your doctor will decide if you should receive CELVAPAN.
Driving and using machines
CELVAPAN may make you feel dizzy or sick which may affect your ability to drive or use machines.

CELVAPAN is given as an injection into the muscle (usually in the upper arm).
The vaccine should never be given into a vein.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
