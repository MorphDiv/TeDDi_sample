Reconciliation Wizard
Reconciling your account ensures your records match those of your institution, and that there are no mistakes on either side. You should reconcile your account whenever you receive a statement from your institution. All relevant information necessary for this process is usually printed on your statement. On the next page you will verify that the starting and ending balances match those on your statement. If not, please modify the figures.
KMyMoney calculates your loan payments automatically. The amounts can deviate from those calculated by the creditor. Therefore, you possibly have to adjust amortization, interest and other costs according to your statement. Please enter the following information found on your statement:
Ending date of statement
Starting date of statement
Verify payments
1
If your statement shows different amounts, please cancel this dialog and correct the false transactions or correct the values in this dialog. In the later case, KMyMoney will create an adjustment transaction and add it to the ledger.
In order to create the adjustment transaction, KMyMoney requires an account and possibly an interest category to assign the differences to. Please select an account and - if necessary - a category.
Interest-Category
Restarting postponed reconciliation
You have previously postponed the reconciliation of this account. If you have entered charges or interests the last time you started reconciling this account you can modify these in the ledger later on. It is important, that you continue with the same statement you used when you postponed the reconciliation. All information you have entered into this wizard will be shown and all transactions that you already cleared are marked with a'C '.

The format of the dates in the QIF file.
Date Format
If a QIF file contains date entries with years represented with two digits then either an apostrophe or a slash may be used to delimit the year in the dates for certain centuries. This enables 1905 to be distinguished from 2005. Specify here which range of years will have year delimited by an apostrophe (eg. for Quicken this is usually 1900-1949).

Detailed description
KMyMoney creates a schedule for this payment and reminds you whenever a payment must be made. Please select the account to/ from which payments will be made and the category the interest will be assigned to. If you selected to record all payments this date has already been supplied. If you selected to record only this years payments, then the First payment due date is the date of the first payment made in this year.
The category the interest part of the payment will be assigned to. If you borrow money you usually have to pay interest, so this should be an expense category. If you lend the money, you receive the interest. In this case, select an income category here.
Select the account from which you make your periodical payments or where you receive regular payments in case you lend the money. In most cases, this is a checking account.
Now enter the details for your loan. You can leave one of the fields empty and KMyMoney will calculate it when you press the Calculate button. Before you can continue with the next page you also need to press Calculate so that KMyMoney can check the logical correctness of the values you have supplied.
The interest rate gets calculated
when the payment is received
when the payment is due
Enter the amount of the loan in this field. If you want to calculate this field out of the other parameters, please leave it empty. If the field is marked as required (colored background) you have informed KMyMoney about the fact that there were already some payments towards the loan. In this case, please enter the ending balance of your last statement.
Please enter the interest rate (as a percentage) or leave the field empty to calculate it.
Please enter the term of this loan or enter 0 to calculate it. The term is the time that is required to fully repay the loan. This time might be different from the time your loan contract is signed for.
Payment (principal and interest)
Please enter the amount you pay for principal and interest or leave the field empty to calculate it.
Balloon payment
Please enter the amount of a final amortization payment or leave the field empty to calculate it.
Calculate
Press this button to calculate/ verify your loan details.
Pressing this button calculates a possibly missing parameter for your loan or verifies that the values entered match. If something is not correct you will receive information about it.
Enter the name of the account under which it is known within KMyMoney. Select the type for the new account. Use the What's this? feature to see more details about the various account types. Enter the date the account was opened and its currency.
Select the currency in which this account is denominated.
The opening balance is the balance of the account when you start using it with KMyMoney. For new accounts this is usually 0 but for existing accounts this may well differ. Please consult the account statements to figure out this value. The opening balance is to be provided in the currency of the account as selected with the currency button.
The opening date would be the date of the last statement. In case you want to keep track of transactions prior to this date, enter the ending balance and statement date of a prior statement and add all following transactions into KMyMoney.
