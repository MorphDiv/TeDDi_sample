Introduction
Logo
& amarok; is an audio player for & kde; that is extremely powerful, yet surprisingly simple to use.
With & amarok; you can simply drag and drop music into the playlist instead of searching through endless menus. Just looking for that one song in a huge collection? & amarok; 's collection browser with its quick-search bar will help you find it in a matter of seconds.
It may seem that & amarok; has the same old features found in the average audio player, but we did not stop there. One look at the context browser and you will see why & amarok; is one step ahead of the rest. The context browser shows all kinds of information related to your currently playing track - from the album cover, through to other music by the same artist, as well as related artists - an informative and fun way to learn about your collection!
Do you already have many different playlists but can never decide on which one you want to use? Then the playlist browser is just for you. Never know what to listen to? Amarok's Dynamic Mode will choose your music for you, and Smart Playlists allow you to jump right in to specific parts of your collection.
Amarok has outstanding support for Apple's iPod, iRiver's ifp and a multitude of generic USB devices. It also features many different audio backends allowing YOU to choose how you listen to your music. These and other features make it the most advanced audio player available. & amarok; is smart, sexy and clever. We hope that its use will truly allow you to "Rediscover your music!"
