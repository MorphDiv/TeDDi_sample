Add Language
This is where you live. KDE will use the defaults for this country or region.
This will add a language to the list. If the language is already in the list, the old one will be moved instead.
This will remove the highlighted language from the list.
KDE programs will be displayed in the first available language in this list. If none of the languages are available, US English will be used.
Here you can choose your country or region. The settings for languages, numbers etc. will automatically switch to the corresponding values.
Here you can choose the languages that will be used by KDE. If the first language in the list is not available, the second will be used, etc. If only US English is available, no translations have been installed. You can get translation packages for many languages from the place you got KDE from. Note that some applications may not be translated to your languages; in this case, they will automatically fall back to US English.

Here you can define the thousands separator used to display monetary values. Note that the thousands separator used to display other numbers has to be defined separately (see the'Numbers' tab).
Here you can set the number of decimal places displayed for monetary values, i. e. the number of digits after the decimal separator. Note that the decimal places used to display other numbers has to be defined separately (see the'Numbers' tab).
If this option is checked, the currency sign will be prefixed (i. e. to the left of the value) for all positive monetary values. If not, it will be postfixed (i. e. to the right).
If this option is checked, the currency sign will be prefixed (i. e. to the left of the value) for all negative monetary values. If not, it will be postfixed (i. e. to the right).
Here you can select how a positive sign will be positioned. This only affects monetary values.
Here you can select how a negative sign will be positioned. This only affects monetary values.
Here you can define the set of digits used to display monetary values. If digits other than Arabic are selected, they will appear only if used in the language of the application or the piece of text where the number is shown. Note that the set of digits used to display other numbers has to be defined separately (see the'Numbers' tab).
