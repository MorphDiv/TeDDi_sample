result_id is a valid result id returned by sesam_query().
Returns a mixed associative / indexed array with meta information (column name, type, precision,...) about individual columns of the result after the query associated with result_id.
Table 1.
Mixed result set returned by sesam_field_array()
Array Element
Contents
int $arr[ "count"]
Total number of columns in result set (or zero if this was an "immediate "query).
SESAM "multiple fields" are "inlined "and treated like the respective number of columns.
string $arr[ col]["name"]
column name for column( col), where col is between 0 and $arr["count" ]-1.
The returned value can be the empty string (for dynamically computed columns).
SESAM "multiple fields" are "inlined "and treated like the respective number of columns, each with the same column name.
string $arr[ col]["count"]
The "count" attribute describes the repetition factor when the column has been declared as a "multiple field ".
Usually, the "count" attribute is 1.
The first column of a "multiple field" column however contains the number of repetitions (the second and following column of the "multiple field "contain a "count" attribute of 1).
This can be used to detect "multiple fields" in the result set.
See the example shown in the sesam_query() description for a sample use of the "count "attribute.
string $arr[ col]["type"]
integer
float
string
string $arr[ col]["sqltype"]
"CHARACTER"
"VARCHAR"
"NUMERIC"
"DECIMAL"
"INTEGER"
"SMALLINT"
"FLOAT"
"REAL"
"DOUBLE"
"DATE"
"TIME"
"TIMESTAMP"
string $arr[ col]["length"]
The SQL "length" attribute of the SQL variable in column (col), where col is between 0 and $arr["count" ]-1.
The "length" attribute is used with "CHARACTER "and "VARCHAR" SQL types to specify the (maximum) length of the string variable.
SESAM "multiple fields" are "inlined "and treated like the respective number of columns, each with the same length attribute.
string $arr[ col]["precision"]
The "precision" attribute of the SQL variable in column (col), where col is between 0 and $arr["count" ]-1.
The "precision" attribute is used with numeric and time data types.
SESAM "multiple fields" are "inlined "and treated like the respective number of columns, each with the same precision attribute.
string $arr[ col]["scale"]
The "scale" attribute of the SQL variable in column (col), where col is between 0 and $arr["count" ]-1.
The "scale" attribute is used with numeric data types.
SESAM "multiple fields" are "inlined "and treated like the respective number of columns, each with the same scale attribute.
See the sesam_query() function for an example of the sesam_field_array() use.
