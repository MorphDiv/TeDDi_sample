To play Five or More one must align colored pieces as the board gets filled with randomly placed pieces. When five or more pieces of the same color get lined up, they disappear. The game ends when the board gets filled up all the way.

Playing
Basic usage
Starting
The main window when you start a game.
As the game progresses, the board gets more and more crowded (unless you are really good...) and making objects disappear gets harder and harder. The game is over, when the board is full.
Game over!
Playing the Game
A game of
To make a move, click on one of the objects. When an object is activated it starts rotating (or doing something else depending on the theme, but let us not anticipate…). You can then select its destination by clicking an empty square. If the path to the destination is clear the activated item travels there. If the destination square is occupied by another object nothing will be moved and the selection will be transferred to the new object. If the path is not clear (you cannot jump objects over obstacles!) the application prints a warning in the status bar (bottom of the window) and the original object remains active.
As objects disappear, you get points. The points you score depends on the number of objects you managed to align (see

How to create new themes
Each theme consists of a single PNG image file. This image consists of an array of seven rows, corresponding to the different object colors/shapes, and four columns, each of which is a frame in the animation of the object. The actual size of the image is irrelevant, it will be rescaled, but the sub-images must form a four by seven grid to get the correct effect. When using SVG remember that the image size is the page size, if your grid does not fill the page try shrinking the page size. Use an existing theme as a guide.
