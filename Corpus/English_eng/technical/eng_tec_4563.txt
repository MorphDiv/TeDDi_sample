(PHP 4)
print_r() displays information about a variable in a way that's readable by humans.
If given a string, integer or float, the value itself will be printed.
If given an array, values will be presented in a format that shows keys and elements.
Similar notation is used for object s.
Remember that print_r() will move the array pointer to the end.
Use reset() to bring it back to beginning.
Tip:
As with anything that outputs its result directly to the browser, you can use the output-control functions to capture the output of this function, and save it in a string (for example).
pre ?php $a = array ('a '= 'apple', 'b' = 'banana', 'c '= array ('x' ,'y' ,'z')); print_r ($a);? / pre
Which will output:
pre Array ([a] = apple [b] = banana [c] = Array ([0] = x [1] = y [2] = z)) / pre
Note:
Prior to PHP 4.0.4, print_r() will continue forever if given an array or object that contains a direct or indirect reference to itself.
An example is print_r( $GLOBALS) because $GLOBALS is itself a global variable that contains a reference to itself.
See also ob_start(), var_dump(), and var_export().
