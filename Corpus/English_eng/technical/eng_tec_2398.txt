(PHP 3, PHP 4)
base64_encode() returns data encoded with base64.
This encoding is designed to make binary data survive transport through transport layers that are not 8-bit clean, such as mail bodies.
Base64-encoded data takes about 33% more space than the original data.
See also: base64_decode(), chunk_split(), RFC 2045 section 6.8.
