Suspension for injection
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Target species
Pigs
4.2 Indications for use, specifying the target species
•
Treatment of bacterial respiratory disease associated with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, and Streptococcus suis.
•
Treatment of septicaemia, polyarthritis or polyserositis associated with Streptococcus suis infection.
4.3
Contraindications
Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to ceftiofur or other β-lactam antibiotics.
4.4 Special warnings
None.
4.5 Special precautions for use
Special precautions for use in animals
Use of the product should be based on susceptibility testing and take into account official and local antimicrobial policies.
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
Penicillins and cephalosporins may cause hypersensitivity following injection, inhalation, ingestion or skin contact.
Hypersensitivity to penicillins may lead to cross reactions to cephalosporins and vice versa.
Allergic reactions to these substances may occasionally be serious.
Do not handle this product if you know you are hypersensitive.
2/20 Avoid contact with skin or eyes.
In the event of contact, wash with clean water.
If you develop symptoms following exposure such as a skin rash or persistent eye irritation, you should seek medical advice.
Swelling of the face, lips or eyes or difficulty with breathing are more serious symptoms and require urgent medical attention.
4.6 Adverse reactions (frequency and seriousness)
Occasionally, transient local swelling may occur following intramuscular injection.
Mild tissue reactions at the injection site, such as small areas (less than 6 cm²) of discolouration and small cysts have been observed for up to 42 days after injection.
Resolution has been observed at 56 days post-injection.
4.7 Use during pregnancy, lactation or lay
Laboratory studies in mice have not produced any evidence of teratogenic, foetotoxic or maternotoxic effects.
Laboratory studies in rats revealed no teratogenic effects but maternotoxic (soft faeces) and foetotoxic (reduced fetal weight) effects were observed.
No effects on the reproductive performance were observed in both species.
No studies have been conducted in pregnant or lactating sows, or in breeding pigs.
Use only according to the benefit/risk assessment by the responsible veterinarian.
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
None known.
4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Intramuscular use.
5 mg ceftiofur/kg body weight (equivalent to 1 ml of NAXCEL per 20 kg body weight) administered once in the neck by intramuscular injection.
Shake bottle vigorously for 30 seconds, or until all visual settlement has been resuspended.
To ensure a correct dosage, body weight should be accurately determined to avoid under-dosing.
It is recommended to limit injection volumes to a maximum of 4 ml.
4.10 Overdose (symptoms, emergency procedures, antidotes), if necessary
Owing to the low toxicity of ceftiofur in pigs overdoses do not typically lead to any clinical signs, other than transient local swellings as described in section 5.4 (undesirable effects).
4.11 Withdrawal period(s)
Meat and offal:
71 days
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Third generation cephalosporins.
ATCvet code:
QJ01DD90
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Ceftiofur is a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic, which is active against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
Ceftiofur inhibits the bacterial cell wall synthesis, thereby exerting bactericidal properties.
3/20 Ceftiofur is particularly active against the following target pathogens causing respiratory and other diseases in pigs:
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, and Streptococcus suis.
Bordetella bronchiseptica is inherently insensitive to ceftiofur in vitro.
Desfuroylceftiofur is the principal active metabolite.
It has an antimicrobial activity similar to that of ceftiofur against the target pathogens.
At the recommended therapeutic dose, concentrations in plasma were higher than the MIC (< 0.2 µg/ml) for the target bacteria isolated in clinical studies for at least 158 hours.
90
values
5.2 Pharmacokinetic particulars
After administration, ceftiofur is quickly metabolised to desfuroylceftiofur, the principal active metabolite.
Protein binding of ceftiofur and its major metabolite is approximately 70%.
One hour after a single administration, plasma concentrations are above 1 µg/ml.
Maximum concentrations in plasma (4.2 ± 0.9 µg/ml) are reached at approximately 22 hours after administration.
Plasma concentrations above 0.2 µg/ml of ceftiofur and its metabolite are maintained for an appropriate period of time.
Approximately 60% and 15% of the dose are excreted in the urine and faeces, respectively, within 10 days after administration.
