Setting Indents, Margins, and Columns
You can define the indents and margins for the current paragraph, or for all selected paragraphs, using the mouse.
If you split the page into columns, or the cursor is placed in a multiple-column text frame, you can change the column width and the column spacing by dragging them on the ruler with the mouse.
When an object, an image, or a draw object is selected, you will see the borders of the object in the ruler.
You can change the borders by dragging them on the ruler with the mouse.
If the cursor is placed in a table cell, you can change the indents for the contents of the cell by dragging them with the mouse on the ruler.
You can change the boundary lines of the table on the ruler or by dragging the actual boundary line.
