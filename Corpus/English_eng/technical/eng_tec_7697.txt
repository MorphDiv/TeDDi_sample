EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
HERCEPTIN
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Herceptin?
Herceptin is a powder that is made up into a solution for infusion (drip into a vein).
It contains the active substance trastuzumab.
What is Herceptin used for?
Herceptin is used to treat breast cancer.
It can only be used when the cancer has been shown to ‘ express ’ HER2: this means that the cancer produces a specific protein called HER2 in large quantities on the surface of the tumour cells.
Herceptin is used in metastatic breast cancer (when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body) and in early breast cancer (which has spread within the breast or to the glands under the arm but not to other parts of the body).
In metastatic breast cancer, Herceptin can be used in the following ways: • on its own in patients who have failed on at least two previous treatments; • in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel (other anticancer medicines); • in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (another type of anticancer medicine), in women who have been through the menopause and whose cancer also expresses receptors for hormones such as oestrogen or progesterone on its surface.
In early breast cancer, Herceptin is used after surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Herceptin used?
Herceptin treatment should only be started by a doctor who has experience in the use of anticancer medicines.
The infusion can be associated with allergic reactions, so the patient should be monitored during and after the infusion.
For metastatic cancer, Herceptin is given every week or every three weeks, and the treatment is continued for as long as it remains effective.
For early cancer, Herceptin is given every three weeks for a year or until it stops being effective.
Herceptin can also be given weekly when used in combination with other anticancer medicines.
For full details, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (also part of the EPAR).
How does Herceptin work?
The active substance in Herceptin, trastuzumab, is a monoclonal antibody.
A monoclonal antibody is an antibody (a type of protein) that has been designed to recognise and bind to a specific structure (called an antigen) that is found on certain cells in the body.
Trastuzumab has been designed to bind to 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

HER2, a receptor for epidermal growth factor, which is found on the surface of certain tumour cells.
By binding to the receptor, trastuzumab activates certain cells of the immune system (the body ’ s natural defences), which then kill the tumour cells.
Trastuzumab also prevents HER2 from breaking, which otherwise leads to a signal for the tumour cells to grow.
About a quarter of breast cancers express large amounts of HER2.
How has Herceptin been studied?
All studies of Herceptin have been in cancers that express HER2.
In metastatic breast cancer, Herceptin given once a week has been studied in four main studies.
One study looked at the use of Herceptin on its own in 222 patients who had failed on other types of chemotherapy before, and two looked at the use of Herceptin in combination with two other anticancer medicines (paclitaxel in 469 patients and docetaxel in 188 patients).
These studies measured how many patients responded to treatment.
The fourth study compared the combination of Herceptin and anastrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) with anastrozole alone in 208 patients.
The main measure of effectiveness was the ‘ median progression-free survival’ (the length of time until 50% of the patients had experienced a worsening of their disease or had died).
Four additional studies looked at the response to Herceptin given once every three weeks, either on its own (two studies in a total of 177 patients), in combination with paclitaxel (in 32 patients) or in combination with docetaxel, with or without capecitabine (another anticancer medicine) in 225 patients.
In early breast cancer, Herceptin has been studied over one to two years in one main study that involved over 3,000 patients who had been first treated with surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Half of the patients received Herceptin, while the other half did not receive it.
The study measured the time until the cancer re-appeared anywhere in the body.
What benefit has Herceptin shown during the studies?
In metastatic breast cancer, the first study showed that 15% of the patients who had failed on other types of chemotherapy responded to Herceptin.
When Herceptin was used in addition to paclitaxel, the response rate was 48%, compared with 17% for paclitaxel on its own.
With docetaxel, 61% of the patients responded, compared with 34% for docetaxel on its own.
When Herceptin was used in combination with anastrozole, the median progression-free survival was 4.8 months, compared with 2.4 months in the patients taking anastrozole on its own.
The additional studies showed that the effectiveness of three-weekly Herceptin was similar to that seen in studies of once-weekly Herceptin.
In the study in early breast cancer, the risk of the cancer coming back within the first year was reduced by about half:
8% of the patients who received Herceptin experienced a re-appearance of their cancer (127 out of 1,693), compared with 13% of the patients who did not receive it (219 out of 1,693).
What is the risk associated with Herceptin?
Herceptin can cause cardiotoxicity (harm to the heart), including heart failure.
Care should be taken if it is given to patients who already have heart problems, and all patients need to be monitored during treatment to check their heart.
The most common side effects with Herceptin (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are abdominal (tummy) pain, asthenia (weakness), chest pain, chills, fever, headache, pain, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain) and skin rashes.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Herceptin, see the Package Leaflet.
Herceptin should not be used in people who are hypersensitive (allergic) to trastuzumab or to any of the other ingredients.
It should also not be used in patients who have serious breathing problems when they are at rest because of their cancer, or who need oxygen therapy.
Why has Herceptin been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Herceptin’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours overexpress HER2 and patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer.
The Committee recommended that Herceptin be given marketing authorisation.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Herceptin?
The company that makes Herceptin will carry out more studies looking at cardiotoxicity, including looking at the guidance supplied to doctors and how to identify patients at risk of heart problems to ensure that they are carefully monitored.
