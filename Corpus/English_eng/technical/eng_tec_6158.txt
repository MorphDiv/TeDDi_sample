& konsolekalendar; is a command line interface to & kde; calendars.
KDE
& package;
& kappname;
KOrganizer
Introduction
& konsolekalendar; is a command line interface to & kde; calendars. It lets you view, insert, remove, or modify calendar events by way of the command line or from a scripting language. Additionally, & konsolekalendar; can create a new & kde; calendar, export a & kde; calendar to a variety of other formats, and import another & kde; calendar.
In its basic mode, & konsolekalendar; displays the list of events in your default calendar for the current day (from 7:00 to 17:00).
Main features of & konsolekalendar;:
View calendar entries from a start date/ time to end date/ time
Insert (add) calendar entries
Remove (delete) calendar entries
Modify (change) calendar entries
Create a new calendar
Export calendar entries to other file formats
Import an existing & kde; calendar
& konsolekalendar; is not another graphical user interface to a & kde; calendar (i. e. & korganizer;). & konsolekalendar; is intended solely for uses where a graphical user interface is not practical or possible.
& konsolekalendar; does not provide a full-featured language for making queries of the user's calendar: nor is it the intention of the authors to ever write such a capability. Primitive command line options are provided for accessing calendar events within a consecutive range of dates/ time stamps.
Features
In this chapter you'll learn about the main features of & konsolekalendar; and how to control them using the command line parameters (remember that & konsolekalendar; is not a graphical user interface; it is a command line program only).
You'll learn about inserting, deleting, and changing calendar events, and how to export events to other file formats. The creation and importation of & kde; calendars will also be covered in this chapter.
Viewing Events
In its default mode, or by using the --view option, & konsolekalendar; will list all events within the range of a specified date/ time.
To view all of today's events (from 7:00 to 17:00), simply run:
% konsolekalendar
In this next example, we view all events for the week of August 18-22:
% konsolekalendar --view --date 2003-08-18 --end-date 2003-08-22
Show the next event(s) on the calendar from the current time forward:
% konsolekalendar --next
To view all events for the next 5 days run:
% konsolekalendar --show-next 5
Inserting Events
& konsolekalendar; can insert events into a & kde; calendar or calendar resource using the --add command line argument. Events successfully inserted will be immediately shown by & kde; calendar applications (like & korganizer;).
In the following example, an event starting on 2003-06-04 (June 4, 2003) at 1000 and ending at 1200 with summary "Doctor Visit" will be inserted into the user's default calendar resource:
% konsolekalendar --add --date 2003-06-04 --time 10:00\\ --end-time 12:00 --summary "Doctor Visit"
In this example, a birthday event is added into the user's default calendar resource:
% konsolekalendar --add --date 2003-06-06 --summary "My Birthday"\\ --description "Party Time"
Here a one week vacation is inserted into a shared vacation calendar:
% konsolekalendar --add --file vacation. ics --date 2003-08-01\\ --end-date 2003-08-07 --summary "Vacation" --description "Nobody will ever find me!"
Removing Entries
& konsolekalendar; supports the removal of entries in a calendar file or resource using the --delete command line argument. Calendar entries to be removed are specified exactly by their Unique-string identifier (UID) using the --uid option. UIDs are found by first viewing the event, using the --view option.
Events successfully deleted will be immediately removed from within & kde; calendar applications (korganizer; for example).
When you delete something from the calendar you cannot undo it! In other words, when you delete an entry you cannot reverse the deletion. It's gone for good.
Here we delete a calendar entry with UID konsolekalendar; -1887551750.196:
% konsolekalendar --delete --uid konsolekalendar; -1887551750.196
Modifying Entries
& konsolekalendar; supports the modification of existing entries in a calendar file or resource using the --change command line argument. Calendar entries to be modified are specified exactly by their Unique-string identifier (UID) using the --uid option. UIDs are found by first viewing the event, using the --view option.
Changing behaves in the same way as inserting: you can change an event's start date and time, end date and time, summary, location, and description. Events successfully changed will be immediately shown modified within & kde; calendar applications (korganizer;).
Example: Here we change the summary and description of a calendar entry with UID konsolekalendar; -1887551750.196:
% konsolekalendar --change --uid konsolekalendar; -1887551750.196 --summary "Get my head examined" --description "do n't go to that doctor anymore!"
Creating a New Calendar File
& konsolekalendar; can be used to create a new & kde; calendar file. Since you cannot insert an entry into a calendar that does not exist, you must create the file first using the --create and --file command line arguments.
Create a calendar file named / data/ share/ calendars/ vacation. ics:
% konsolekalendar --create --file / data/ share/ calendars/ vacation. ics
Exporting to Other Formats
& konsolekalendar; can export a & kde; calendar to other well known formats. Exporting is a special form of viewing. By default, events are viewed in konsolekalendar; text format. To change the viewing format use the --export-type command line argument.
To see a list of all supported export formats, use the --export-list option, as in:
% konsolekalendar --export-list
Export Formats
Some, but not necessarily all, of the supported formats are described in the this section.
& konsolekalendar; Text Format
& konsolekalendar; Text Format is & konsolekalendar; 's native format and is designed to be comfortable to read and to be parsed by follow-on scripts.
The & konsolekalendar; Text Format is:
Date: \ lt; Incidence Dategt; (dddd yyyy-MM-dd) [\ lt; Incidence Start Timegt; (hh: mm) - & lt; Incidence End Timegt; (hh: mm)] Summary: \ lt; Incidence Summary | "(no summary available)"gt; Location: \ lt; Incidence Location |" (no location available)"gt; Description: \ lt; Incidence Description | "(no description available)"gt; UID: \ lt; Incidence UIDgt; --------------------------------------------------
For example:
Date: Tuesday 2003-11-01 08:00 - 09:00 Summary: Staff Meeting Location: Conference Room Description: Meet with the entire staff to discuss the project. UID: & konsolekalendar; -1128954167.1013 --------------------------------------------------
& konsolekalendar; Short Text Format
Short Text Format provides a more compact, less verbose version of & konsolekalendar; 's native format.
The & konsolekalendar; Short Text Format is:
[--------------------------------------------------] {lt; Incidence Dategt; (dddd yyyy-MM-dd)] [lt; Incidence Start Timegt; (hh: mm) - & lt; Incidence End Timegt; (hh: mm) | "\ "] \ lt; Incidence Summary | \ gt; [, & lt; Incidence Locationgt;] \ \ lt; Incidence Description | "\ "gt;
-------------------------------------------------- Tuesday 2003-11-01 08:00 - 09:00 Staff Meeting, Conference Room Meet with the entire staff to discuss the project.
Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Format
Comma-Separated Value Format displays the event values in the same order as & konsolekalendar; Text format. The only difference is that all the information is on the same row with each field separated by a comma. The resulting exported files can be imported directly into spreadsheet programs like & kspread;, OpenOffice. org Calc, and Microsoft; Excel. Also, CSV format is easy to parse with follow-on scripts.
The Comma-Separated Value (CSV) format is:
YYYY-MM-DD, HH: MM, YYYY-MM-DD, HH: MM, Summary, Location, Description, UID
2003-11-01,08:00,2003-11-01,09:00, Staff Meeting, Conference Room, Meet in the big conference\\ room with the entire staff. ,konsolekalendar; -1128954167.1013
& HTML; Format
The & HTML; export format will produce a valid & HTML; file that can be published to the WWW. This export format is not suitable for follow-on script parsing, but is very nice for publishing calendars for easy public viewing.
TODO: Insert screenshot here
HTMLmonth Format
This format produces an & HTML; file showing all appointments in the months specified by the date range. This export format is not suitable for follow-on script parsing, but is very nice for publishing calendars for easy public viewing.
Importing Calendars
& konsolekalendar; can import an iCal or vCal calendar file into a & kde; calendar. All events from the calendar being imported from will be inserted, including identical events. In the next & konsolekalendar; release identical events will not be inserted.
To import calendar file another. ics into calendar current. ics run:
% konsolekalendar --import another. ics --file current. ics

Questions and Answers
& reporting. bugs; & updating. documentation;
What configuration files does & konsolekalendar; use?
None.
What are the application names of & konsolekalendar;?
& konsolekalendar; 's application name is konsolekalendar.
What is the date specification format?
& konsolekalendar; will reject dates specified on the command line unless they are specified according to ISO 8601 standards, namely: YYYY-MM-DD. Where YYYY represents a four-digit year (like 2003), MM represents a two-digit month (01,02,.. ,12), and DD represents a two-digit day (01,02,... ,31).
& konsolekalendar; always exports dates according to the ISO 8601 format.
What is the time specification format?
& konsolekalendar; will reject times specified on the command line unless they are specified according to ISO 8601 standards, namely: HH: MM: SS. Where HH represents a two-digit hour (01,02,... ,24), MM represents a two-digit minute (01,02,.. ,60), and SS represents a two-digit second (01,02,... ,60).
& konsolekalendar; always exports times according to the ISO 8601 format.
Will & konsolekalendar; insert a new event that is identical to one that already exists in the calendar?
No. See next question.
How does & konsolekalendar; determine if an event is identical to one that already exists in the calendar?
& konsolekalendar; checks the specified start date and time, end date and time, and summary against all events in the calendar. An event match is determined if all three values match to an existing event.
Can a non-floating event be changed to a floating event?
Yes. Use the --time float option with --change.
Why are event UIDs printed in most export formats?
Because you need to specify UIDs to delete or change events. If you do not want to see event UIDs then use the short export type (--export-type short).

Installation
How to obtain & konsolekalendar;
& install. intro. documentation;
& konsolekalendar; comes included with & kde; 4 and is not available separately.
Requirements
& konsolekalendar; requires the standard & kde; libraries to be installed (the kdelibs package and kdepimlibs). To compile from source, you also need the & Qt;, kdelibs and kdepimlibs development packages.
You can find a list of changes in the ChangeLog file.
Configuration
No special configuration is required to set up & konsolekalendar; to run on the & kde; desktop.
awinterz@users. sourceforge. net
Compilation and installation
This section provides a quick overview of the build process. Please read Compiling & kde; 3.2. x for complete instructions.
If you cannot obtain a suitable precompiled binary package, you need to compile & konsolekalendar; yourself from source files. Get the source package file kdepim-x. x. tar. bz2. Unpack it in a new folder using a command similar to tar xvfj package. tar. bz2, and change to the folder which has been created.
& install. compile. documentation;
If you have more than one version of & kde; installed (e. g. & kde; 2 and & kde; 3), this may possibly install & konsolekalendar; into the wrong & kde; folder. If necessary, you can give the & kde; folder as a parameter to. / configure. For example, if your & kde; is installed in / opt/ kde3:
. / configure --prefix= / opt/ kde3
