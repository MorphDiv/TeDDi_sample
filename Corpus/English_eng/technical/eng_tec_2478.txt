constant() will return the value of the constant indicated by name.
constant() is useful if you need to retrieve the value of a constant, but do not know it's name. i.e.
It is stored in a variable or returned by a function.
Example 1. constant() example
?php define ("MAXSIZE", 100); echo MAXSIZE; echo constant("MAXSIZE"); / / same thing as the previous line?
See also define(), defined() and the section on Constants.
