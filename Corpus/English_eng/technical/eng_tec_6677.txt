Marble Cache Settings
& Drag location:
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} While dragging the mouse there are two standard behaviours when dealing with a virtual globe: The location below mouse pointer will follow the cursor exactly: As a result e. g. the north pole will not stay at the top which can lead to confusion. By default Marble makes sure that north is always up which results in a dragging behaviour where the location below the mouse pointer slightly "detaches" from the cursor.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} By default Marble will display the home location immediately after the application has started. As an alternative it can also show the last position that was active when the user left the application.
Show Home Location
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} When searching for a location Marble can either move instantly to the new location or it can show a travel animation from the previous place to the new place.
& Distance:
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} The unit that gets used to measure altitude, lengths and distances (e. g. km, mi, ft).
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Specifies the notation of angles in coordinates: By default the Degree-Minute-Second notation (e. g. 54°30'00 ") gets used. As an alternative you can choose decimal degrees (e. g. 54.5°).
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Specifies the map quality that gets displayed while there is no user input. Usually this allows for high map quality as speed is no concern.
Outline Quality
Print Quality
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Specifies the map quality that gets displayed during map animations (e. g. while dragging the globe). Especially on slow machines it is advisable to set this option to "low quality" as this will give better speed.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Places often have different names in different languages. The label on the map can show the name in the user's language. Alternatively it can display the name in the official language and glyphs of that place.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} The default font that gets used on the map.

Increasing the value will make the application more responsive. The hard disc memory cache is used by download contents from the internet (e. g. Wikipedia data or map data). Decrease this value if you want to save space on the hard disc and if high usage of the internet is not an issue.
