Power Management Backends
The battery monitor supports a number of power management backends. If it is available, the monitor will attempt to use the freedesktop.org
Not all power management backends are available from all vendors, and some vendors add their own additional backends for specific platforms and hardware. If the battery monitor is misreporting information from your battery see
Getting Help
If the battery monitor doesn't work for you, see these additional resources:

Preferences
To bring up the preferences for the monitor, right-click on the monitor in the panel and then choose

Appearance
Compact view
Compact View
This view shows only a single graphic in the panel, either an upright battery to indicate remaining capacity or a plug to indicate your laptop is connected to an external power source.
The compact view is the default view for the monitor as of GNOME 2.12.
Expanded view
Expanded View
The expanded view is old look from previous versions of GNOME. It has the larger graphic for the battery as well as a separate graphic to indicate what state the battery is in.
Show time/percentage
Selecting this option will display one of two pieces of information.
Notifications
Warn when battery charge drops to
Selecting this option will cause a warning dialog to be displayed whenever your laptop battery reaches specified value, either as a percentage remaining or a number of minutes remaining. This indicates that the amount of charge remaining in your battery is critically low. charge. You can dismiss this warning dialog yourself, otherwise it will vanish automatically when you plug your laptop into mains power.
Notify when the battery is fully recharged
Selecting this option notifies when your battery is fully recharged. If you have compiled the Battery Charge Monitor with libnotify support a non-intrusive notification will popup from the monitor on the panel.
Troubleshooting
Due to the complexities of power management and the vast differences between each of the different power management systems available, debugging errors in the battery monitor can be difficult. You will need to determine if the error exists in the battery monitor or is a bug in the information provided by your machine.
The following information may be useful for troubleshooting what is wrong with your battery monitor. It is by no means exhaustive. If you find a bug with the Battery Charge Monitor (that is not caused by bad information being reported by ACPI), please
Determining the backend
Check you're using the HAL backend
If you are using the Hardware Abstraction Layer (see
Other backends do not currently give indication they are being used, so you will have to guess based on your hardware. Most modern PC laptops are using ACPI as the backend. This is also the backend with the largest number of inconsistencies.
Checking the ACPI information
If you are using the ACPI backend for the Battery Charge Monitor, it is important to check that ACPI is giving you the right information. If it isn't, then you will need to look into upgrading your DSDT or something else related to ACPI.
