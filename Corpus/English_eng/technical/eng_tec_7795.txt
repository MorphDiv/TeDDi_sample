EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
CELSENTRI
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is CELSENTRI?
CELSENTRI is a medicine containing the active substance maraviroc.
It is available as blue, oval tablets (150 or 300 mg).
What is CELSENTRI used for?
CELSENTRI is an antiviral medicine.
It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
CELSENTRI is only used in patients who have been treated for HIV infection before and only when the HIV-1 they are infected with is ‘ CCR5-tropic’, which is determined by a blood test.
This means that the virus, when infecting a cell, attaches to a specific protein called CCR5 on the surface of the cell.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is CELSENTRI used?
Treatment with CELSENTRI should be initiated by a doctor who has experience in the management of HIV infection.
Before treatment, the doctor must check that the patient ’ s blood only shows infection with CCR5-tropic virus, using a newly drawn blood sample and a reliable ‘ tropism test’.
The recommended dose is 150, 300 or 600 mg twice a day, depending on the other medicines that the patient is taking.
It can be taken with or without food.
CELSENTRI should be used with caution in patients aged over 65 years and in patients who have problems with their liver.
Patients who have kidney problems may need to take CELSENTRI less frequently if they are taking other medicines that are broken down in the body (metabolised) in the same way as CELSENTRI, and their response to treatment should be closely monitored.
For more information, see the Summary of Product Characteristics (also part of the EPAR).
There is no information on switching to CELSENTRI from another type of medicine for HIV infection in patients whose HIV is being treated successfully, when no virus can be detected in their blood.
There is also no information on the re-use of CELSENTRI in patients who have taken it in the past, but in whom it stopped working.
Other treatments should be considered in these cases.
How does CELSENTRI work?
The active substance in CELSENTRI, maraviroc, is a ‘ CCR5 antagonist’.
It blocks a protein called CCR5, which is found on the surface of the cells in the body that HIV infects.

By attaching itself to the protein, maraviroc prevents it from entering the cells.
Maraviroc cannot work when the virus in a blood sample attaches to another protein called CXCR4, or when it can attach to both CCR5 and CXCR4.
As HIV can only reproduce itself within cells, CELSENTRI, taken in combination with other antiviral medicines, reduces the level of CCR5-tropic HIV in the blood of patients, and keeps it at a low level.
CELSENTRI does not cure HIV infection or AIDS, but it may delay the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.
How has CELSENTRI been studied?
The effects of CELSENTRI were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
CELSENTRI was studied in two main studies involving a total of 1,076 patients with CCR5-tropic HIV infection.
The patients had taken other treatments for HIV for at least six months, but these had stopped working.
The effects of CELSENTRI, taken once or twice a day, were compared with those of placebo (a dummy treatment).
All of the patients also took ‘ optimised background therapy’ (a combination of other antiviral medicines chosen for each patient as it had the best chances of reducing the levels of HIV in the blood).
The main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) after 24 weeks.
What benefit has CELSENTRI shown during the studies?
CELSENTRI was more effective than placebo in reducing viral loads, when taken in combination with optimised background therapy.
Looking at the results of the two studies taken together, viral loads had fallen by an average of 99% after 24 weeks in the patients adding CELSENTRI to optimised background therapy, compared with 90% in those adding placebo.
The proportion of patients who had undetectable levels of HIV in their blood was about 45% when CELSENTRI was added to optimised background therapy compared with 23% of the patients receiving optimised background therapy only.
Similar results were also observed when looking at the patients who continued treatment with CELSENTRI 300 mg twice a day for 48 weeks.
The once- and twice-daily doses of CELSENTRI were of similar effectiveness.
However, the twice- daily dose was slightly more effective in patients who were at risk of a reduced response to HIV treatment, due to high viral load, low levels of immunity or few available treatment options.
What is the risk associated with CELSENTRI?
The most common side effect with CELSENTRI (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) is nausea (feeling sick).
For the full list of all side effects reported with CELSENTRI, see the Package Leaflet.
CELSENTRI should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to maraviroc, peanut, soya or any of the other ingredients.
As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking CELSENTRI may be at risk of immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system) or osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue).
Patients who have problems with their liver (including hepatitis B or C infection) may be at an elevated risk of liver damage when taking CELSENTRI.
Why has CELSENTRI been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that CELSENTRI’ s benefits are greater than its risks, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for treatment- experienced adult patients infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable.
The Committee recommended that CELSENTRI be given marketing authorisation.

The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for CELSENTRI to Pfizer Limited on 18 September 2007.
