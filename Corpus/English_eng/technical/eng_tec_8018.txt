EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
FOCETRIA
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Focetria?
Focetria is a vaccine.
It is a suspension for injection that contains some parts (outer membranes) of the influenza (flu) virus.
It contains a flu strain called A/ Viet Nam/ 1194/ 2004 (H5N1).
What is Focetria used for?
Focetria is a vaccine that can only be used once a flu ‘ pandemic’ has been officially declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) or European Union (EU).
A flu pandemic occurs when a new type (strain) of flu virus emerges that can spread easily from person to person because people have no immunity (protection) against it.
A pandemic can affect most countries and regions around the world.
Focetria would be given according to official recommendations.
The vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Focetria used?
Focetria is given in two doses, at least three weeks apart.
It is given by injection into the upper arm muscle.
How does Focetria work?
Focetria is a ‘ mock-up’ vaccine.
This is a special type of vaccine that can be developed to help with the management of a pandemic.
Before a pandemic starts, nobody knows which strain of flu virus will be involved, so companies cannot prepare the correct vaccine in advance.
Instead, they can prepare a vaccine that contains a strain of flu virus specifically chosen because nobody has been exposed to it, and to which nobody is immune.
They can test this vaccine to see how people react to it, allowing them to predict how people will react when the flu strain causing a pandemic is included.
Vaccines work by ‘ teaching’ the immune system (the body’ s natural defences) how to defend itself against a disease.
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the virus as ‘ foreign’ and makes antibodies against it.
The immune system will then be able to produce antibodies more quickly when it is exposed to the virus again.
This helps to protect against the disease.
Focetria contains small amounts of parts of a virus called H5N1.
The virus has been first inactivated (killed) so that it does not cause any disease.
The outer membranes that contain the ‘ surface antigens ’ (proteins on the outer membrane of the virus that the body recognises as foreign) have then been extracted and purified.
The vaccine also contains an ‘ adjuvant ’ (a compound containing oil) to stimulate a better response.
If a pandemic starts, the virus strain in Focetria will be replaced by the strain causing the pandemic before the vaccine can be used.

The effects of Focetria were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The main study of Focetria included 486 healthy subjects (a third of whom were over the age of 60) and compared the ability of two doses of Focetria to trigger the production of antibodies (immunogenicity).
The participants received two injections of Focetria, containing either 7.5 or 15 micrograms of haemagglutinin (a protein found in flu viruses), 21 days apart.
The main measures of effectiveness were the levels of antibodies against the flu virus in the patients’ blood before vaccination, on the day of the second injection (day 22), and 21 days later (day 43).
What benefit has Focetria shown during the studies?
According to criteria laid down by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), a mock-up vaccine needs to bring about protective levels of antibodies in at least 70% of people for it to be considered suitable.
The study showed that Focetria produced an antibody response that satisfies these criteria.
Twenty-one days after the second injection, 86% of the people receiving the vaccine with 7.5 micrograms haemagglutinin had levels of antibodies that would protect them against H5N1.
The figure was 85% in the patients who received the 15-micrograms dose.
What is the risk associated with Focetria?
The most common side effects with Focetria (seen in between 1 and 10 people in 100) are headache, sweating, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain), reactions at the site of the injection (redness, swelling, hardening, bruising, pain), fever, malaise (feeling unwell), fatigue (tiredness) and shivering.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Focetria, see the Package Leaflet.
Focetria should not be given to patients who have had an anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) to any of the components of the vaccine, or to any substances found at trace levels in the vaccine, such as eggs, chicken protein, kanamycin or neomycin sulphate (two antibiotics), formaldehyde, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and polysorbate 80.
If a pandemic has started, however, it may be appropriate to give the vaccine to these patients, as long as facilities for resuscitation are available.
Why has Focetria been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Focetria’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation.
The committee recommended that Focetria be given marketing authorisation.
Focetria has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that because the strain of flu virus that may cause a pandemic is not known, it has not been possible to obtain full information about the future pandemic vaccine.
Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary.
What information is still awaited for Focetria?
If a pandemic is declared, the company that makes Focetria will include the flu strain responsible in the vaccine.
It will then collect information on the safety and effectiveness of the final pandemic vaccine, and submit this to the CHMP for evaluation.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Focetria?
If Focetria is used during a pandemic, the company that makes it will collect information on the safety of the vaccine while it is being used.
This will include information on its side effects and its safety in children, pregnant women, patients with severe conditions, and people who have problems with their immune systems.
Other information about Focetria:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Focetria to Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S. r. l. on 2 May 2007.
