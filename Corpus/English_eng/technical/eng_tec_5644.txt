Introduction
Gametype:
Arcade
Number of possible players:
Multiplayer
& granatier; is a clone of the classic Bomberman game, inspired by the work of the Clanbomber clone.
The object of the game is to run through an arena, using bombs to clear out blocks and eliminate your opponents. Several bonuses and handicaps are hidden underneath the blocks & ndash; these can either help or hinder your progress.

How to play
Objective:
Eliminate all Opponents.
Each player is provided with five keys that they use to move their character and lay bombs. For example, the default keys for Player 1 are the Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys to move respectively in those directions, and the & Enter; key to lay a bomb. Please refer to the Player Configuration Section to find shortcut keys for other players, as well as how to configure them.
The purpose of laying bombs, aside from attacking other opponents, is to destroy the many blocks scattered throughout the arena in order to clear a path or uncover hidden bonuses. Among the many bonuses that can be uncovered are those that make you move faster or increase your bomb blast range; the more bonuses of this type you collect, the easier it is to eliminate your opponents and win the round. But be warned that just as many handicaps exist that can turn the tide against you, including those that slow you down or invert your moving keys.
For each won round, the player is awarded a point. The first player to win a predefined number of points (the default is 3), wins the game!
Game Rules, Strategies and Tips
The Items
The Arena
The players are in an arena which consists of:
Arena Wall
The Wall & ndash; this defines the outline of the arena map and cannot be destroyed.
Arena Ground
The Ground & ndash; this can be walked on safely.
Arena Ice
The Ice & ndash; this will make the ground slippery. The speed increases on the ice and it is not possible to completly stop moving.
Arena Block
The Block & ndash; this can be destroyed with a bomb, and may contain a bonus (or a handicap).
Arena Bomb Mortar
The Bomb Mortar & ndash; this will throw bombs that are placed on it to random places.
Arena Arrow Right
The Arrows & ndash; this will move the bombs that are placed on it to the direction they point.
If there is none of the above items, there is a hole at the ground and moving into it will result in falling into the deep and die. The same applies also if there is no wall at the edge of the arena and the player moves outside of the arena.
The Bonuses
Bonuses are helpful for reaching the game goal and effects exists permanent - even after a handicap disappears. Currently there are following bonuses:
Bonus Speed
Speed & ndash; increases your speed slightly.
Bonus Bomb
Bomb & ndash; adds an extra bomb to your arsenal, allowing you to lay more than one bomb at a time.
Bonus Power
Power & ndash; increases the power of your bombs, extending their bomb blast range.
Bonus Shield
Shield & ndash; makes invincible for one bomb blast.
Bonus Throw
Throw & ndash; adds the ability to throw bombs. Just press the key for laying bombs while a bomb is below you.
Bonus Kick
Kick & ndash; adds the ability to move bombs. Just run against an bomb and the bomb will move.
The Handicaps
Handicaps are the opposite of bonuses and hinder the player. The good thing is that effects get lost after some time (other than bonuses) and the player can play in is usual behavior (including bonuses) again. Currently there are following handicaps:
Handicap Slow
Slow & ndash; makes you move very slowly.
Handicap Hyperactive
Hyperactive & ndash; makes you move a little TOO fast.
Handicap Mirror
Mirror & ndash; inverts your moving keys, so that up becomes down and left becomes right.
Handicap Scatty
Scatty & ndash; forces you to continuously lay bombs without control.
Handicap Restrain
Restrain & ndash; prevents you to lay bombs.
The ambivalent Items
This type of bonuses are neither good nor bad, it mostly depends on the environment. Currently there are following neutral bonuses:
Bonus Neutral Pandora
Pandora & ndash; this contains either a bonus or a handicap.
Bonus Neutral Resurrect
Resurrect & ndash; this will resurrect any dead player.
