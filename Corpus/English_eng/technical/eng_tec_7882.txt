EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
TRISENOX
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is TRISENOX?
TRISENOX is a concentrate for solution for infusion containing the active substance arsenic trioxide (1 mg/ ml).
What is TRISENOX used for?
TRISENOX is used to treat adult patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), a rare form of leukaemia (cancer of the white blood cells).
APL is caused by a genetic ‘ translocation’ (when there is a swap of genes between two chromosomes).
The translocation affects the way the white blood cells grow, and they lack the ability to use retinoic acid (vitamin A).
Patients with APL are normally treated with retinoids (substances derived from vitamin A).
TRISENOX is used when patients have not responded to treatment with retinoids and anticancer medicines, or when their disease has come back after this type of treatment.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is TRISENOX used?
TRISENOX treatment should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with acute leukaemias.
TRISENOX is given daily until there are signs that the treatment is working (the bone marrow does not contain any leukaemia cells).
If this does not happen by day 50, dosing should be stopped.
The first treatment is then consolidated, three to four weeks later, by giving TRISENOX once daily for five days, followed by a two-day break, repeated for five weeks.
TRISENOX is given as an infusion (drip into a vein) over one to two hours, but this may be increased to four hours if there are infusion reactions.
The dose is 0.15 mg per kilogram body weight for all types of patients (children, adults and elderly patients).
How does TRISENOX work?
The active substance in TRISENOX, arsenic trioxide, is a chemical that has been used in medicines for many years, including for the treatment of leukaemia.
The way it works in this disease is not completely understood.
It is thought to prevent the DNA production necessary for leukaemia cell growth.
How has TRISENOX been studied?
TRISENOX has been examined in two studies involving 52 patients with APL who had been previously treated with anthracyline (a type of anticancer medicine) and a retinoid.
The first study 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

TRISENOX was not compared with any other medicine in either study.
The main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of patients who had complete remission, with no leukaemia cells in the bone marrow and recovery of the levels of platelets and white blood cells in the blood.
What benefit has TRISENOX shown during the studies?
Looking at the results of the two studies together, 45 (87%) of the 52 patients had complete remission.
On average, it took 57 days for the patients to reach complete remission.
What is the risk associated with TRISENOX?
The most commonly reported side effects with TRISENOX (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are neutropenia (low levels of white blood cells), thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets), hyperglycaemia (raised blood sugar levels), hypokalaemia (low blood potassium levels), paraesthesia (pins and needles), pleuritic pain (chest pain), dyspnoea (breathlessness), bone pain, arthralgia (joint pain), pyrexia (fever), fatigue (tiredness), prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram (irregular heart beat), and increased levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (liver enzymes).
For the full list of all side effects reported with TRISENOX, see the Package Leaflet.
TRISENOX should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to arsenic trioxide or any of the other ingredients.
Because arsenic trioxide can affect the heart, patients receiving TRISENOX should be closely monitored, and should have electrocardiograms before and during treatment.
Why has TRISENOX been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that TRISENOX’ s benefits are greater than its risks for induction of remission and consolidation in adult patients with relapsed/ refractory APL, characterised by the presence of the t(15; 17) translocation and/ or the presence of the Pro-Myelocytic Leukaemia/ Retinoic-Acid-Receptor-alpha (PML/ RAR-alpha) gene, when previous treatment has included a retinoid and chemotherapy.
The Committee recommended that TRISENOX be given marketing authorisation.
TRISENOX has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
This means that because the disease is rare, it has not been possible to obtain complete information about TRISENOX.
Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary.
What information is still awaited for TRISENOX?
The company that makes TRISENOX will complete its studies into the use of TRISENOX in patients with liver cancer and its use with retinoids and chemotherapy in APL.
Other information about TRISENOX:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for TRISENOX on 5 March 2002.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 5 March 2007.
The marketing authorisation holder is Cephalon Europe.
The full EPAR for TRISENOX is available here.
