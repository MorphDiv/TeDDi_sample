OR operator (logical)
OR Operator [Run-time]
Performs a logical OR disjunction on two expressions.
Syntax:
Result = Expression1 OR Expression2
Parameters:
Result:
A numerical variable that will contain the result of the disjunction.
Expression1, Expression2:
Boolean or numerical expressions that you want to compare.
A logical OR disjunction of two Boolean expressions returns the value True if at least one comparison expression is True.
A bit-wise comparison sets a bit in the result if the corresponding bit is set in at least one of the two expressions.
Example:
Sub ExampleOr
Dim vA as Variant, vB as Variant, vC as Variant, vD as Variant
Dim vOut as Variant
vA = 10: vB = 8: vC = 6: vD = Null
vOut = vA > vB Or vB > vC REM -1
vOut = vB > vA Or vB > vC REM -1
vOut = vA > vB Or vB > vD REM -1
vOut = (vB > vD Or vB > vA) REM 0
vOut = vB Or vA REM 10
End Sub
