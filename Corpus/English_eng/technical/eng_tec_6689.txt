What should be typed in the activity box?
There is a simple syntax that enables you to add details to your activities:
 
"@" symbol marks a category. Example: "watering flowers@home" will start tracking the activity "watering flowers" in the category "home".

Commas (",") mark beginning of a description. Example: "watering flowers, begonias and forgetmenots" will start tracking the activity "watering flowers" and add the description "begonias and forgetmenots" to it.

Both can be combined: "watering flowers@home, begonias and forgetmenots" will work just fine!

Now, start tracking!

Hamster would like to observe you some more!
With %s percent of all facts starting before 9am you seem to be an early bird.
With %s percent of all facts starting after 11pm you seem to be a night owl.
With %s percent of all tasks being shorter than 15 minutes you seem to be a busy bee.
