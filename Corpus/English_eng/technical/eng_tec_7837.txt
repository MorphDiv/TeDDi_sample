ANNEX
CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES
1 CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES
The Member States shall ensure that prior to launch the MAH provides health care professionals in dialysis centres and retail pharmacies with:
• Educational leaflet • Summary of product characteristics (SPC) and Package Leaflet and Labelling • Cool boxes for patients clearly labelled with a visual aid indicating correct use of product.
The educational leaflet shall contain the following key elements: • That the use of epoetin alfa products can cause immunogenicity which in rare cases may lead to Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) • That with other epoetin products, the risk of immunogenicity in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is increased with the subcutaneous (sc) route. • There is insufficient data on Epoetin alfa HEXAL to know the size of any increased immunogenicity risk with sc use • Therefore, the sc route is not recommended for patients with CKD • The loss of efficacy or other symptoms of the development of immunogenicity should be investigated • Any suspected case of Pure Red Cell Aplasia or development of immunogenicity should be reported to the MAH
