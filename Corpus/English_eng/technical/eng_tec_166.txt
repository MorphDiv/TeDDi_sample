Function Wizard
Function Wizard
, which helps you to interactively create formulae.
Before you start the Wizard, select a cell or a range of cells from the current sheet, in order to determine the position at which the formula will be inserted.
OASIS
web site.
Function Wizard
has two tabs:
Functions
is used to create formulae and
Structure
is used to check the formula build.
Functions Tab
List of Categories and Functions
Category
Lists all the categories to which the different functions are assigned.
Select a category to view the appropriate functions in the list field below.
Select &quot; All &quot; to view all functions in alphabetical order, irrespective of category. &quot; Last Used &quot; lists the functions you have most recently used.
Function
Displays the functions found under the selected category.
Double-click to select a function.
A single-click displays a short function description.
Array
Specifies that the selected function is inserted into the selected cell range as an array formula.
Array formulae operate on multiple cells.
Each cell in the array contains the formula, not as a copy but as a common formula shared by all matrix cells.
Array
option is identical to the
Command
Ctrl
+Shift+Enter command, which is used to enter and confirm formulae in the sheet.
The formula is inserted as a matrix formula indicated by two braces { }.
The maximum size of an array range is 128 by 128 cells.
Argument Input Fields
date entries
make sure you use the correct format.
Click OK to insert the result into the spreadsheet.
Function Result
error code
is displayed.
The input entries that are required are indicated by bold argument names.
f(x) (dependent on selected function)
Function Wizard
in order to enter a nested function within the function, instead of a value or reference.
Argument/Parameter/Cell Reference (dependent on selected function)
The number of visible text fields depends on the function.
Enter arguments either directly into the argument fields or click a cell in the table.
Result
Displays the calculation result or an error message.
Formula
Displays the created formula.
Type your entries directly or create the formula with assistance of the Wizard.
Back
Moves the focus back through the formula components, marking them as it does so.
To select a single function from a complex formula consisting of several functions, double-click the function in the formula window.
Next
Moves forwards through the formula components in the formula window.
This button can also be used to assign functions to the formula.
If you select a function and click the
Next
button, the selection appears in the formula window.
Double-click a function in the selection window to transfer it to the formula window.
Cancel
Closes the dialogue box without implementing the formula.
OK
Function Wizard
and transfers the formula into the selected cell or cells.
List of Categories and Functions
Structure tab
In this page you can view the structure of the function.
Function Wizard
while the cell cursor is positioned in a cell that already contains a function, the
Structure
tab is opened and shows the composition of the current formula.
Structure
Displays a hierarchical representation of the current function.
You can hide or show the arguments by a click on the plus or minus sign in front.
Blue dots denote correctly entered arguments.
Red dots indicate incorrect data types.
For example: if the SUM function has one argument entered as a text string, this is highlighted in red as SUM only permits number entries.
