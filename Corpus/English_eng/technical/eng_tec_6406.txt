kdeinit4
8
Start all other & kde; programs and kdeinit loadable modules (KLMs).
Synopsis
kdeinit4 --help --no-fork --no-kded --suicide +programs programs
Description
kdeinit4 is a process launcher somewhat similar to the famous init used for booting UNIX. It executes & kde; programs and kdeinit loadable modules (KLMs) starting them more efficiently.
Using kdeinit4 to launch & kde; applications makes starting a typical & kde; application a couple times faster and reduces memory consumption by a substantial amount.
kdeinit4 is linked against all libraries a standard & kde; application needs. With this technique, starting an application becomes much faster because now only the application itself needs to be linked whereas otherwise both the application as well as all the libaries it uses need to be linked.
Disadvantages
The process name of applications started via kdeinit4 is "kdeinit4". This problem can be corrected to a degree by changing the application name as shown by ps. However, applications like killall will only see kdeinit4 as the process name. To workaround this, use kdekillall (from kdesdk/ scripts) for applications started via kdeinit4.
Options
--help
Show help about options
--no-fork
Do not fork, i. e. do not exit until all the executed programs ends
--no-kded
Do not start kded
--suicide
Terminate when no KDE applications are left running
+programs
runs the programs handling requests
programs
runs the programs without handling requests
Usage
A standard way to run this program is by simply specifying the following command at the prompt kdeinit4 program or kdeinit4 +program
Files
/ tmp/ kde-$USER/ kdeinit4_$INSTANCE
...
Environment Variables
$HOME
Specifies the home directory of the current user
$KDE_HOME_READONLY
Specifies if the home directory of the current user is read only
$KDE_IS_PRELINKED
If set, tells kdeinit4 that the & kde; programs are pre-linked.
(Prelinking is a process that allows you to speed up the process of dynamic linking.)
$KDE_DISPLAY
If set, tells kdeinit4 that it is running on a & kde; desktop.
