These functions allow you to use the CrackLib library to test the 'strength' of a password.
The 'strength' of a password is tested by that checks length, use of upper and lower case and checked against the specified CrackLib dictionary.
CrackLib will also give helpful diagnostic messages that will help 'strengthen' the password.
More information regarding CrackLib along with the library can be found at http: / /www.users.dircon.co.uk / ~crypto /.
In order to use these functions, you must compile PHP with Crack support by using the --with-crack[ =DIR] option.
The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini.

CrackLib example
?php / / Open CrackLib Dictionary $dictionary = crack_opendict( '/ usr / local / lib / pw_dict') or die('Unable to open CrackLib dictionary'); / / Perform password check $check = crack_check($dictionary, 'gx9A2s0x'); / / Retrieve messages $diag = crack_getlastmessage(); echo $diag; / / 'strong password' / / Close dictionary crack_closedict($dictionary);?
