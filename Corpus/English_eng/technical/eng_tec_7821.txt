ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS 1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Fasturtec 1.5 mg/ ml powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
After reconstitution, 1 ml of Fasturtec concentrate contains 1.5 mg rasburicase.
Fasturtec is a recombinant urate-oxidase enzyme produced by genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain.
Rasburicase is a tetrameric protein with identical subunits of a molecular mass of about 34 kDa.
1 mg corresponds to 18.2 EAU*.
*One enzyme activity unit (EAU) corresponds to the enzyme activity that converts 1 µmol of uric acid into allantoin per minute under the operating conditions described: +30 °C ± 1 °C TEA pH 8.9 buffer.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion.
The powder is an entire or broken white to off white pellet.
The solvent is a colourless and clear liquid.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1.
Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of acute hyperuricaemia, in order to prevent acute renal failure, in patients with haematological malignancy with a high tumour burden and at risk of a rapid tumour lysis or shrinkage at initiation of chemotherapy.
4.2.
Posology and method of administration
Fasturtec should be administered under the supervision of a physician trained in chemotherapy of haematological malignancies.
Fasturtec is to be used immediately prior to and during the initiation of chemotherapy only, as at the present, there is insufficient data to recommend multiple treatment courses.
The recommended dose for Fasturtec is 0.20 mg/ kg/ day.
Fasturtec is administered as a once daily 30 minute intravenous infusion in 50 ml of a sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution (see section 6.6).
The duration of treatment with Fasturtec may be up to 7 days, the exact duration should be based upon adequate monitoring of uric acid levels in plasma and clinical judgment.
Administration of rasburicase does not require any change in the timing or schedule of initiation of cytoreductive chemotherapy.
Rasburicase solution should be infused over 30 minutes.
Rasburicase solution should be infused through a different line than that used for infusion of chemotherapeutic agents to prevent any possible drug incompatibility.
If use of a separate line is not possible, the line should be flushed out with saline
2 solution between infusion of chemotherapeutic agents and rasburicase.
For instruction on use, see section 6.6.
Because rasburicase may degrade uric acid in vitro, special precautions must be used during sample handling for plasma uric acid measurements, see section 6.6.
Additional information on special populations Renally or hepatically impaired patients:
No dose adjustment is necessary.
Paediatric patients:
As no adjustment is necessary, the recommended dose is 0.20 mg/ kg/ day.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
G6PD deficiency and other cellular metabolic disorders known to cause haemolytic anaemia.
Hydrogen peroxide is a by-product of the conversion of uric acid to allantoin.
In order to prevent possible haemolytic anaemia induced by hydrogen peroxide, rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with these disorders.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Rasburicase like other proteins, has the potential to induce allergic responses in humans.
Clinical experience with Fasturtec demonstrates that patients should be closely monitored for the onset of allergic-type undesirable effects, especially severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis (see section 4.8).
In such cases, treatment should immediately and permanently be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated.
Caution should be used in patients with a history of atopic allergies.
At present, there is insufficient data available on patients being retreated to recommend multiple treatment courses.
Anti-rasburicase antibodies have been detected in treated patients and healthy volunteers administered rasburicase.
Methaemoglobinaemia has been reported in patients receiving Fasturtec.
Fasturtec should immediately and permanently be discontinued in patients having developed methaemoglobinaemia, and appropriate measures initiated (see section 4.8).
Haemolysis has been reported in patients receiving Fasturtec.
In such case, treatment should immediately and permanently be discontinued and appropriate measures initiated (see section 4.8).
Administration of Fasturtec reduces the uric acid levels to below normal levels and by this mechanism reduces the chance of development of renal failure due to precipitation of uric acid crystals in renal tubules as a consequence of hyperuricaemia.
Tumour lysis can also result in hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia.
Fasturtec is not directly effective in the treatment of these abnormalities.
Therefore, patients must be monitored closely.
Fasturtec has not been investigated in the patients with hyperuricemia in the context of myeloproliferative disorders.
There is no data available to recommend the sequential use of Fasturtec and allopurinol.
To ensure accurate measurement of uric acid plasma level during treatment with Fasturtec, a strict sample handling procedure must be followed (see section 6.6).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No metabolism studies have been performed.
Rasburicase being an enzyme itself, it would be an unlikely candidate for drug-drug interactions.
3 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
For rasburicase no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Animal studies with respect to effects on parturition and postnatal development have not been performed (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Fasturtec should not be used during pregnancy or in breast- feeding women.
It is unknown whether rasburicase is excreted in human milk.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Fasturtec is concomitantly administered as supportive care to cytoreductive chemotherapy of advanced malignancies, the causality of adverse events is therefore difficult to assess due to the significant burden of adverse events expected from the underlying disease and its treatment.
The most significant drug-related adverse events were common allergic reactions, mainly rashes and urticaria.
Cases of hypotension (< 1%), bronchospasm (< 1%), rhinitis (< 0.1%) and severe hypersensitivity reactions (< 1%), including anaphylaxis (< 0.1%) have also been attributed to Fasturtec.
In clinical trials, haematological disorders such as haemolysis, haemolytic anaemia and methaemoglobinaemia are uncommonly caused by Fasturtec.
The enzymatic digestion of uric acid to allantoin by rasburicase produces hydrogen peroxide and haemolytic anaemia or methaemoglobinaemia have been observed in certain at risk populations such as those with G6PD deficiency.
In addition, grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions possibly attributable to Fasturtec and reported in the clinical trials, are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency.
Frequencies are defined as: common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100).
Nervous system disorders
Common
Uncommon Headache Diarrhoea
Gastrointestinal disorders General disorders and administration site conditions
Fever
Vomiting Nausea
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
4.9 Overdose
In view of the mechanism of action of Fasturtec, an overdose will lead to low or undetectable plasma uric acid concentrations and increased production of hydrogen peroxide.
Thus patients suspected of receiving an overdose should be monitored for haemolysis, and general supportive measures should be initiated as no specific antidote for Fasturtec has been identified.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Detoxifying agents for antineoplastic treatment, ATC code:
V03AF07.
In humans, uric acid is the final step in the catabolic pathway of purines.
The acute increase in plasma
4 levels of uric acid subsequent to the lysis of large numbers of malignant cells and during cytoreductive chemotherapy may lead to impairment of renal function and renal failure resulting from the precipitation of crystals of uric acid in renal tubules.
Rasburicase is a highly potent uricolytic agent that catalyses enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into allantoin, a water soluble product, easily excreted by the kidneys in the urine.
The enzymatic oxidation of uric acid leads to stoichiometric formation of hydrogen peroxide.
The increased of hydrogen peroxide over ambient levels can be eliminated by endogenous antioxidants and the only increased risk is for haemolysis in G6PD deficient and inherited anaemia patients.
In healthy volunteers, a marked dose-related decrease in plasma uric acid levels was observed across the dose range 0.05 mg/ kg to 0.20 mg/ kg of Fasturtec.
A randomised comparative phase III study, using the recommended dose, showed a significantly more rapid onset of action of Fasturtec in comparison with allopurinol.
At 4 hours post first dose, there was a significant difference in the mean percentage change from baseline plasma uric acid concentration (p < 0.0001) in the Fasturtec group (-86.0%) compared to that for the allopurinol group (-12.1%).
Time to first confirmation of normal levels of uric acid in hyperuricaemic patients is four hours for Fasturtec and 24 hours for allopurinol.
In addition this rapid control of uric acid in this population is accompanied by improvements in renal function.
In turn, this allows efficient excretion of the serum phosphate load preventing further deterioration of renal function from calcium/ phosphorus precipitation.
Paediatric patients In pivotal clinical studies, 246 patients (< 18 years) were treated with rasburicase at doses of 0.15 mg/ kg/ day or 0.20 mg/ kg/ day for 1 to 8 days (mainly 5 to 7 days).
Efficacy results on 229 evaluable patients showed an overall response rate (normalization of plasma uric acid levels) of 96.1%.
Safety results on 246 patients were consistent with the adverse events profile in the overall population.
In long term safety studies, an analysis of data from 867 patients (< 18 years) treated with rasburicase at 0.20 mg/ kg/ day for 1 to 24 days (mainly 1 to 4 days) showed consistent findings with pivotal clinical studies in terms of efficacy and safety.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
After infusion of rasburicase at a dose of 0.20 mg/ kg/ day, steady state is achieved at day 2 - 3.
No unexpected accumulation of rasburicase was observed.
In patients, the volume of distribution ranged from 110 - 127 ml/ kg, which is comparable to the physiological vascular volume.
Clearance of rasburicase was ca.
3.5 ml/ h/ kg and the elimination half-life ca.
19 hours.
The patients included in the pharmacokinetic studies were mainly children and adolescents.
Based upon these limited data, it seems that clearance is increased (ca.
35%) in children and adolescents compared to adults, resulting in a lower systemic exposure.
Rasburicase is a protein, and therefore:
1) not expected to bind to proteins, 2) expected that metabolic degradation will follow the pathways of other proteins, i. e. peptide hydrolysis, 3) unlikely to be candidate for drug-drug interactions.
Renal elimination of rasburicase is considered to be a minor pathway for rasburicase clearance.
As metabolism is expected to occur by peptide hydrolysis, an impaired liver function is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.
The interpretation of the non-clinical studies is hampered due to the presence of endogenous urate oxidase in standard animal models.

6.2 Incompatibilities
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in section 6.6.
Rasburicase solution should be infused through a different line than that used for infusion of chemotherapeutic agents to prevent any possible drug incompatibility.
If use of a separate line is not possible, the line should be flushed out with saline solution between chemotherapeutic agent infusions and rasburicase.
No filter should be used for infusion.
Do not use any glucose solution for dilution due to potential incompatibility.
6.3 Shelf life
3 years.
After reconstitution or dilution an immediate use is recommended.
However, the in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours between +2 °C and 8 °C.
6.4 Special precautions for storage

Do not freeze.
Store in the original package in order to protect from light.
For storage conditions of the reconstituted or the diluted medicinal product, see section 6.3.
6.5 Nature and contents of container
Fasturtec is supplied as a pack of:
3 vials of 1.5 mg rasburicase and 3 ampoules of 1 ml solvent.
The powder is supplied in 3 ml clear glass (type I) vial with a rubber stopper and the solvent in a 2 ml clear glass (type I) ampoule.
1 vial of 7.5 mg rasburicase and 1 ampoule of 5 ml solvent.
The powder is supplied in 10 ml clear glass (type I) vial with a rubber stopper and the solvent in a 5 ml clear glass (type I) ampoule.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
6 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
Rasburicase must be reconstituted with the entire volume of the supplied solvent ampoule (1.5 mg rasburicase vial to be reconstituted with the 1 ml solvent ampoule; 7.5 mg rasburicase vial to be reconstituted with the 5 ml solvent ampoule).
Reconstitution results in a solution with a concentration of 1.5 mg/ ml rasburicase to be further diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) intravenous solution.
Reconstitution of the solution:
Add the content of one ampoule of solvent to one vial containing rasburicase and mix by swirling very gently under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
Do not shake.
Inspect visually prior to use.
Only clear and colourless solutions without particles should be used.
For single-use only, any unused solution should be discarded.
The solvent contains no preservative.
Therefore the reconstituted solution should be diluted under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
Dilution before infusion:
The required volume of the reconstituted solution depends on the patient's body weight.
The use of several vials may be necessary to obtain the quantity of rasburicase required for one administration.
The required volume of the reconstituted solution, taken from one or more vials, is to be further diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution to make a total volume of 50 ml.
The concentration of rasburicase in the final solution for infusion depends on the patient's body weight.
The reconstituted solution contains no preservative.
Therefore the diluted solution should be infused immediately.
Infusion:
The final solution should be infused over 30 minutes.
Sample handling:
If it is necessary to monitor a patient’ s uric acid level, a strict sample-handling procedure must be followed to minimise ex vivo degradation of the analyte.
Blood must be collected into pre-chilled tubes containing heparin anticoagulant.
Samples must be immersed in an ice/ water bath.
Plasma samples should immediately be prepared by centrifugation in a pre-cooled centrifuge (4 °C).
Finally, plasma must be maintained in an ice/ water bath and analysed for uric acid within 4 hours.

Further information
1.
WHAT FASTURTEC IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Fasturtec contains the active ingredient rasburicase.
Rasburicase is used to treat or prevent high blood levels of uric acid from occurring in patients with disorders of the blood cells (haematological diseases) who are about to receive or are receiving chemotherapy treatment.
When chemotherapy is given, cancer cells are destroyed, releasing large amounts of uric acid into the bloodstream.
Fasturtec works by allowing uric acid to more easily be removed from the body by the kidneys.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE FASTURTEC
Do not use Fasturtec if you:
- are allergic (hypersensitive) to rasburicase, other uricases or any of the other ingredients of
Fasturtec
- have a history of haemolytic anaemia (an illness caused by red blood cells being abnormally
broken down).
Take special care with Fasturtec if you:
- have a history of any kind of allergy.
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any allergic type reactions due to other medicines as Fasturtec can cause allergic-type reactions, including severe cases.
It is not known whether the chance of developing an allergic reaction is increased if treatment with Fasturtec is repeated.
In case of disorders of the blood in which red blood cells are abnormally broken down (haemolysis) or abnormal blood pigment levels (methaemoglobinaemia), your doctor will immediately and permanently discontinue treatment with Fasturtec.
Using other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines, including
23 medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast feeding Tell your doctor if you are, or think you may be pregnant, or if you are breast-feeding.
Driving and using machines No information on the ability to drive and use machines is available.
3.
HOW TO USE FASTURTEC
Fasturtec is to be given to you before or during the start of your course of chemotherapy.
Fasturtec is injected slowly into a vein, which should take about 30 minutes.
Your dose will be calculated according to your body weight.
The recommended dose is 0.20 mg per kg of body weight per day in both children and adults.
It will be given once a day, for up to 7 days.
During treatment with Fasturtec, your doctor will carry out blood tests to check the levels of uric acid and decide how long you will be treated for.
Your doctor may also test your blood to make sure that you do not develop any blood disorders.
If you use more Fasturtec than you should If it does occur, the doctor will closely monitor the effects on your red blood cells and treat any symptoms that follow.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Fasturtec can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Fasturtec will be administered at the same time as other medicines that may also cause side effects.
If you suddenly notice:
- a swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other part of your body
- a shortness of breath, wheezing or breathing problems
- a rash, itching or hives
tell your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist immediately as these may be signs of a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).
These are rare (affecting between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 patients).
Common side effects (affecting between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 patients):
- high fever
- allergic reactions, mainly rashes and urticaria.
Uncommon side effects (affecting between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 patients):
- severe allergic reaction, such as low blood pressure (hypotension) and wheezing or difficulty in
breathing (bronchospasm)
- severe diarrhoea
- severe vomiting
- severe nausea
- severe headache
- blood disorders such as a disorder of the blood in which red blood cells are abnormally broken
down (haemolysis) or abnormal blood pigment levels (methaemoglobinaemia).
24 Rare (affecting between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 patients):
- runny or blocked nose, sneezing, facial pressure or pain (rhinitis).
If you notice any of these, tell your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor, nurse or hospital pharmacist.

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
See section 3 “ How to use Fasturtec” and practical information on preparation and handling given below.
Fasturtec must be reconstituted with the entire volume of the supplied solvent (e. g.
1.5 mg rasburicase vial to be reconstituted with the 1 ml solvent ampoule; 7.5 mg rasburicase vial to be reconstituted with the 5 ml solvent ampoule).
Reconstitution results in a solution with a concentration of 1.5 mg/ ml to be further diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%).
Reconstitution of the solution:
Add the content of one ampoule of solvent to one vial containing rasburicase and mix by swirling very gently under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
Do not shake.
Inspect visually prior to use.
Only clear and colourless solutions without particles should be used.
For single-use only, any unused solution should be discarded.
The solvent contains no preservative.
Therefore the reconstituted solution should be diluted under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
Dilution before infusion:
The required volume of the reconstituted solution depends on the patient's body weight.
The use of several vials may be necessary to obtain the quantity of rasburicase required for one administration.
The required volume of the reconstituted solution, taken from one or more vials, is to be further diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution to make a total volume of 50 ml.
The concentration of rasburicase in the final solution for infusion depends on the patient's body weight.
27 The reconstituted solution contains no preservative.
Therefore the diluted solution should be infused immediately.
Infusion:
The final solution should be infused over 30 minutes.
Sample handling:
If it is necessary to monitor a patient’ s uric acid level, a strict sample-handling procedure must be followed to minimise ex vivo degradation of the analyte.
Blood must be collected into pre-chilled tubes containing heparin anticoagulant.
Samples must be immersed in an ice/ water bath.
Plasma samples should immediately be prepared by centrifugation in a pre-cooled centrifuge (4 °C).
Finally, plasma must be maintained in an ice/ water bath and analysed for uric acid within 4 hours.
