Options
& Keep passphrase in memory
When this option is enabled, the passphrase of your private key will be remembered by the application as long as the application is running. Thus you will only have to enter the passphrase once. Be aware that this could be a security risk. If you leave your computer, others can use it to send signed messages and/ or read your encrypted messages. If a core dump occurs, the contents of your RAM will be saved onto disk, including your passphrase. Note that when using KMail, this setting only applies if you are not using gpg-agent. It is also ignored if you are using crypto plugins.
Always encrypt to self
When this option is enabled, the message/ file will not only be encrypted with the receiver's public key, but also with your key. This will enable you to decrypt the message/ file at a later time. This is generally a good idea.
& Show signed/ encrypted text after composing
When this option is enabled, the signed/ encrypted text will be shown in a separate window, enabling you to know how it will look before it is sent. This is a good idea when you are verifying that your encryption system works.
Always show the encryption keys & for approval
When this option is enabled, the application will always show you a list of public keys from which you can choose the one it will use for encryption. If it is off, the application will only show the dialog if it cannot find the right key or if there are several which could be used.
