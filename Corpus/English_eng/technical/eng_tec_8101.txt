CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
- Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients
treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.
- Mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC).
- In children and adults with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/ l, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration of filgrastim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events.
- Treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC ≤ 1.0 x 109/ l) in patients with advanced HIV
infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other therapeutic options are inappropriate.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Filgrastim therapy should only be given in collaboration with an oncology centre which has experience in granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment and haematology and has the necessary diagnostic facilities.
2 The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration with an oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the monitoring of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed.
Zarzio is available in strengths of 30 MU/ 0.5 ml and 48 MU/ 0.5 ml.
Established cytotoxic chemotherapy
The recommended dose of filgrastim is 0.5 MU/ kg/ day (5 μ g/ kg/ day).
The first dose of filgrastim should not be administered less than 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Daily dosing with filgrastim should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range.
Following established chemotherapy for solid tumours, lymphomas, and lymphoid leukaemias, it is expected that the duration of treatment required to fulfil these criteria will be up to 14 days.
Following induction and consolidation treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia the duration of treatment may be substantially longer (up to 38 days) depending on the type, dose and schedule of cytotoxic chemotherapy used.
In patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, a transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen 1 - 2 days after initiation of filgrastim therapy.
However, for a sustained therapeutic response, filgrastim therapy should not be discontinued before the expected nadir has passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range.
Premature discontinuation of filgrastim therapy, prior to the time of the expected neutrophil nadir, is not recommended.
Patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation The recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 1.0 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day).
The first dose of filgrastim should not be administered less than 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy and within 24 hours of bone marrow infusion.
Dose adjustments:
Once the neutrophil nadir has been passed, the daily dose of filgrastim should be titrated against the neutrophil response as follows:
Absolute neutrophil count ANC > 1.0 x 109/ l for 3 consecutive days Then, if ANC remains > 1.0 x 109/ l for 3 more consecutive days
Filgrastim dose adjustment Reduce to 0.5 MU/ kg/ day (5 μ g/ kg/ day) Discontinue filgrastim
If the ANC decreases to < 1.0 x 109/ l during the treatment period, the dose of filgrastim should be re-escalated according to the above steps
Mobilisation of PBPC
Patients undergoing myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC transplantation The recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone is 1.0 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day) for 5 - 7 consecutive days.
Timing of leukapheresis:
1 or 2 leukaphereses on days 5 and 6 are often sufficient.
In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses may be necessary.
Filgrastim dosing should be maintained until the last leukapheresis.
The recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is 0.5 MU/ kg/ day (5 μ g/ kg/ day) given daily from the first day after completion of chemotherapy until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range.
Leukapheresis should be performed during the period when the ANC rises from< 0.5 x 109/l to > 5.0 x 109/l.
For patients who have not had extensive chemotherapy, one leukapheresis is often sufficient.
In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses are recommended.
There are no prospectively randomised comparisons of the two recommended mobilisation methods (filgrastim alone or in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy) within the same patient population.
The degree of variation between individual patients and between laboratory assays of
3 CD34+ cells means that direct comparison between different studies is difficult.
It is therefore difficult to recommend an optimum method.
The choice of mobilisation method should be considered in relation to the overall objectives of treatment for an individual patient.
Normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation For PBPC mobilisation in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation, filgrastim should be administered at 1.0 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day) for 4 - 5 consecutive days.
Leukapheresis should be started at day 5 and continued until day 6 if needed in order to collect 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/ kg recipient bodyweight (BW).
Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN)
Congenital neutropenia The recommended starting dose is 1.2 MU/ kg/ day (12 μ g/ kg/ day) as a single dose or in divided doses.
Idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia The recommended starting dose is 0.5 MU/ kg/ day (5 μ g/ kg/ day) as a single dose or in divided doses.
Dose adjustments Filgrastim should be administered daily until the neutrophil count has reached and can be maintained at more than 1.5 x 109/ l.
When the response has been obtained, the minimal effective dose to maintain this level should be established.
Long-term daily administration is required to maintain an adequate neutrophil count.
After 1 - 2 weeks of therapy, the initial dose may be doubled or halved depending upon the patient's response.
Subsequently the dose may be individually adjusted every 1 - 2 weeks to maintain the average neutrophil count between 1.5 x 109/ l and 10 x 109/ l.
A faster schedule of dose escalation may be considered in patients presenting with severe infections.
In clinical studies, 97% of patients who responded had a complete response at doses of ≤ 2.4 MU/ kg/ day (24 μ g/ kg/ day).
The long-term safety of filgrastim administration above 2.4 MU/ kg/ day (24 μ g/ kg/ day) in patients with SCN has not been established.
HIV infection
Reversal of neutropenia The recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 0.1 MU/ kg/ day (1 μ g/ kg/ day) given daily with titration up to a maximum of 0.4 MU/ kg/ day (4 μ g/ kg/ day) until a normal neutrophil count is reached and can be maintained (ANC > 2.0 x 109/ l).
In clinical studies, > 90% of patients responded at these doses, achieving reversal of neutropenia in a median of 2 days.
In a small number of patients (< 10%), doses up to 1.0 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day) were required to achieve reversal of neutropenia.
Maintenance of normal neutrophil counts When reversal of neutropenia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose to maintain a normal neutrophil count should be established.
Initial dose adjustment to alternate day dosing with 30 MU/ day (300 μ g/ day) is recommended.
Further dose adjustment may be necessary, as determined by the patient's ANC, to maintain the neutrophil count at > 2.0 x 109/ l.
In clinical studies, dosing with 30 MU/ day (300 μ g/ day) on 1 - 7 days per week was required to maintain the ANC > 2.0 x 109/ l, with the median dose frequency being 3 days per week.
Long-term administration may be required to maintain the ANC > 2.0 x 109/ l.
Special populations
Patients with renal/ hepatic impairment Studies of filgrastim in patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function demonstrate that it exhibits a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to that seen in normal individuals.
Dose adjustment is not required in these circumstances.
4 Paediatric patients in the SCN and cancer settings In clinical studies 65% of patients treated for SCN were younger than 18 years.
For this age-group, which mostly includes patients with congenital neutropenia, efficacy was proven.
There were no differences in the safety profiles for paediatric patients treated for SCN in comparison to adults.
Data from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.
The dosage recommendations in paediatric patients are the same as those in adults receiving myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Elderly patients In clinical investigations with filgrastim a small number of elderly patients was included.
No specific studies have been performed for this patient population.
Therefore, specific posology recommendations for these patients cannot be made.
Method of administration
Established cytotoxic chemotherapy Filgrastim may be administered as a daily subcutaneous injection or alternatively as a daily intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.
For further instructions on dilution with glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution prior to infusion see section 6.6.
The subcutaneous route is preferred in most cases.
There is some evidence from a study of single dose administration that intravenous dosing may shorten the duration of effect.
The clinical relevance of this finding to multiple dose administration is not clear.
The choice of route should depend on the individual clinical circumstance.
In randomised clinical studies, a subcutaneous dose of 23 MU/ m2/ day (230 μ g/ m2/ day) or rather 0.4 - 0.84 MU/ kg/ day (4 - 8.4 μ g/ kg/ day) was used.
Patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation Filgrastim is administered as an intravenous short-term infusion over 30 minutes or as a subcutaneous or intravenous continuous infusion over 24 hours, in each case after dilution in 20 ml of glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution.
For further instructions on dilution with glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution prior to infusion see section 6.6.
Mobilisation of PBPC Subcutaneous injection.
For the mobilisation of PBPC in patients undergoing myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC transplantation the recommended dose of filgrastim may also be administered as a 24 hour subcutaneous continuous infusion.
For infusions filgrastim should be diluted in 20 ml of glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution.
For further instructions on dilution with glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution prior to infusion see section 6.6.
SCN/ HIV infection Subcutaneous injection.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Special warnings
Filgrastim should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established posology regimens (see below).
5 Filgrastim should not be administered to patients with severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome) with abnormal cytogenetics (see below).
Established cytotoxic chemotherapy
Malignant cell growth Since investigations showed that G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro the following warnings should be considered.
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myelogenous leukaemia have not been established.
Therefore filgrastim is not indicated for use in these conditions.
Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia.
In view of limited safety and efficacy data in patients with secondary AML, filgrastim should be administered with caution.
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged < 55 years with good cytogenetics [t(8; 21), t(15; 17), and inv(16)] have not been established.
Leucocytosis White blood cell counts of 100 x 109/ l or greater have been observed in less than 5% of patients receiving filgrastim at doses above 0.3 MU/ kg/ day (3 μ g/ kg/ day).
No undesirable effects directly attributable to this degree of leucocytosis have been reported.
However, in view of the potential risks associated with severe leucocytosis, a white blood cell count should be performed at regular intervals during filgrastim therapy.
If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/ l after the expected nadir, filgrastim should be discontinued immediately.
However, during the period of administration of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation, it should be discontinued or its dose should be reduced if the leukocyte counts rise to > 70 x 109/ l.
Risks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy Special caution should be used when treating patients with high-dose chemotherapy because improved tumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic agents may lead to increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, and dermatologic effects (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the specific chemotherapy agents used).
Treatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
Because of the potential of receiving higher doses of chemotherapy (e. g. full doses on the prescribed schedule) the patient may be at greater risk of thrombocytopenia and anaemia.
Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended.
Special care should be taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia.
The use of filgrastim-mobilised PBPCs has been shown to reduce the depth and duration of thrombocytopenia following myelosuppressive or myeloablative chemotherapy.
Other special precautions The effects of filgrastim in patients with substantially reduced myeloid progenitors have not been studied.
Filgrastim acts primarily on neutrophil precursors to exert its effect in elevating neutrophil counts.
Therefore, in patients with reduced precursors, neutrophil response may be diminished (such as those treated with extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or those with bone marrow infiltration by tumour).
There have been reports of Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see section 5.1).
6 Mobilisation of PBPC
Prior exposure to cytotoxic agents Patients who have undergone very extensive prior myelosuppressive therapy, followed by administration of filgrastim for mobilisation of PBPCs, may not show sufficient mobilisation of these blood cells to achieve the recommended minimum yield (≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/ kg) or acceleration of platelet recovery to the same degree.
Some cytotoxic agents exhibit particular toxicities to the haematopoietic progenitor pool and may adversely affect progenitor mobilisation.
Agents such as melphalan, carmustine (BCNU) and carboplatin, when administered over prolonged periods prior to attempts at progenitor mobilisation may reduce progenitor yield.
However, the administration of melphalan, carboplatin or BCNU together with filgrastim has been shown to be effective for progenitor mobilisation.
When a PBPC transplantation is envisaged it is advisable to plan the stem cell mobilisation procedure early in the treatment course of the patient.
Particular attention should be paid to the number of progenitors mobilised in such patients before the administration of high-dose chemotherapy.
If yields are inadequate, as measured by the criteria above, alternative forms of treatment not requiring progenitor support should be considered.
Assessment of progenitor cell yields In assessing the number of progenitor cells harvested in patients treated with filgrastim, particular attention should be paid to the method of quantitation.
The results of flow cytometric analysis of CD34+ cell numbers vary depending on the precise methodology used and therefore, recommendations of numbers based on studies in other laboratories need to be interpreted with caution.
Statistical analysis of the relationship between the number of CD34+ cells re-infused and the rate of platelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy indicates a complex but continuous relationship.
The recommendation of a minimum yield of ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/ kg is based on published experience resulting in adequate haematologic reconstitution.
Yields in excess of this minimum yield appear to correlate with more rapid recovery, those below with slower recovery.
Normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation Mobilisation of PBPC does not provide a direct clinical benefit to normal donors and should only be considered for the purposes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
PBPC mobilisation should be considered only in donors who meet normal clinical and laboratory eligibility criteria for stem cell donation with special attention to haematological values and infectious disease.
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim have not been assessed in normal donors< 16 years or > 60 years.
Transient thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 109/ l) following filgrastim administration and leukapheresis was observed in 35% of subjects studied.
Among these, two cases of platelets < 50 x 109/ l were reported and attributed to the leukapheresis procedure.
If more than one leukapheresis is required, particular attention should be paid to donors with platelets < 100 x 109/ l prior to leukapheresis; in general apheresis should not be performed if platelets < 75 x 109/ l.
Leukapheresis should not be performed in donors who are anticoagulated or who have known defects in haemostasis.
Filgrastim administration should be discontinued or its posology should be reduced if the leukocyte counts rise to > 70 x 109/ l.
Donors who receive G-CSFs for PBPC mobilisation should be monitored until haematological indices return to normal.
Long-term safety follow-up of donors is ongoing.
For up to 4 years, there have been no reports of abnormal haematopoiesis in normal donors.
Nevertheless, a risk of promotion of a
7 malignant myeloid clone can not be excluded.
It is recommended that the apheresis centre perform a systematic record and tracking of the stem cell donors to ensure monitoring of long-term safety.
Transient cytogenic modifications have been observed in normal donors following G-CSF use.
The significance of these changes in terms of the development of haematological malignancy is unknown.
Common but generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and very rare cases of splenic rupture have been reported in healthy donors and patients following administration of G-CSFs.
Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal.
Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e. g. clinical examination, ultrasound).
A diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in donors and/ or patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain.
In normal donors, pulmonary adverse events (haemoptysis, pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary infiltrates, dyspnoea and hypoxia) have been reported very rarely in post marketing experience.
In case of suspected or confirmed pulmonary adverse events, discontinuation of treatment with filgrastim should be considered and appropriate medical care given.
Recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim Current data indicate that immunological interactions between the allogeneic PBPC graft and the recipient may be associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD when compared with bone marrow transplantation.
SCN
Blood cell counts Platelet counts should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy.
Consideration should be given to intermittent cessation or decreasing the dose of filgrastim in patients who develop thrombocytopenia, i. e. platelets consistently < 100,000/ mm3.
Other blood cell changes occur, including anaemia and transient increases in myeloid progenitors, which require close monitoring of cell counts.
Transformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome Special care should be taken in the diagnosis of SCNs to distinguish them from other haematopoietic disorders such as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia, and myeloid leukaemia.
Complete blood cell counts with differential and platelet counts, and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and karyotype should be performed prior to treatment.
There was a low frequency (approximately 3%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukaemia in clinical study patients with SCN treated with filgrastim.
This observation has only been made in patients with congenital neutropenia.
MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease and are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy.
A subset of approximately 12% of patients who had normal cytogenetic evaluations at baseline were subsequently found to have abnormalities, including monosomy 7, on routine repeat evaluation.
If patients with SCN develop abnormal cytogenetics, the risks and benefits of continuing filgrastim should be carefully weighed; Filgrastim should be discontinued if MDS or leukaemia occurs.
It is currently unclear whether long-term treatment of patients with SCN will predispose patients to cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic transformation.
It is recommended to perform morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow examinations in patients at regular intervals (approximately every 12 months).
Other special precautions Causes of transient neutropenia, such as viral infections should be excluded.
Splenic enlargement is a direct effect of treatment with filgrastim.
31% of patients in studies were documented as having palpable splenomegaly.
Increases in volume, measured radiographically, occurred early during Filgrastim therapy and tended to plateau.
Dose reductions were noted to slow or stop the progression of splenic enlargement, and in 3% of patients a splenectomy was required.
Spleen size should be evaluated regularly.
Abdominal palpation should be sufficient to detect abnormal increases in splenic volume.
8 Haematuria/ proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients.
Regular urine analyses should be performed to monitor this event.
The safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia have not been established.
HIV infection
Blood cell counts ANC should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy.
Some patients may respond very rapidly and with a considerable increase in neutrophil count to the initial dose of filgrastim.
It is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for the first 2 - 3 days of filgrastim administration.
Thereafter, it is recommended that the ANC is measured at least twice per week for the first 2 weeks and subsequently once per week or once every other week during maintenance therapy.
During intermittent dosing with 30 MU/ day (300 μ g/ day) of filgrastim, there can be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time.
In order to determine a patient's trough or nadir ANC, it is recommended that blood samples are taken for ANC measurement immediately prior to any scheduled dosing with filgrastim.
Risk associated with increased doses of myelosuppressive medicinal products Treatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to myelosuppressive treatments.
As a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater number of these medicinal products with filgrastim therapy, the patient may be at higher risk of developing thrombocytopenia and anaemia.
Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended (see above).
Infections and malignancies causing myelosuppression Neutropenia may be due to bone marrow-infiltrating opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex or malignancies such as lymphoma.
In patients with known bone marrow-infiltrating infections or malignancy, consider appropriate therapy for treatment of the underlying condition in addition to administration of filgrastim for treatment of neutropenia.
The effects of filgrastim on neutropenia due to bone marrow-infiltrating infection or malignancy have not been well established.
Other special precautions
Rare pulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF administration (see section 4.8).
Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk.
The onset of pulmonary signs, such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs of pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function may be preliminary signs of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
Filgrastim should be discontinued and appropriate treatment given in these cases.
Monitoring of bone density may be indicated in patients with underlying osteoporotic bone diseases who undergo continuous therapy with filgrastim for more than 6 months.
Sickle cells crises, in some cases fatal, have been reported with the use of filgrastim in subjects with sickle cell disease.
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of filgrastim in patients with sickle cell disease, and only after careful evaluation of the potential risks and benefits.
Increased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging findings.
This should be considered when interpreting bone imaging results.
Excipients
Zarzio contains sorbitol.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not use this medicinal product.
9 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim given on the same day as myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been definitively established.
In view of the sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of filgrastim is not recommended in the period from 24 hours before to 24 hours after chemotherapy.
Preliminary evidence from a small number of patients treated concomitantly with filgrastim and 5-fluorouracil indicates that the severity of neutropenia may be exacerbated.
Possible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not yet been investigated in clinical studies.
Since lithium promotes the release of neutrophils, lithium is likely to potentiate the effect of filgrastim.
Although this interaction has not been formally investigated, there is no evidence that such an interaction is harmful.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of filgrastim in pregnant women.
There are reports in the literature where the transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women has been demonstrated.
There is no evidence from studies in rats and rabbits that filgrastim is teratogenic.
An increased incidence of embryo-loss has been observed in rabbits, but no malformation has been seen.
In pregnancy, the possible risk of filgrastim use to the foetus must be weighed against the expected therapeutic benefit.
It is not known whether filgrastim is excreted in human milk, therefore it is not recommended for use in breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Filgrastim has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most commonly reported adverse reactions to filgrastim are mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain occurring in more than 10% of patients.
Musculoskeletal pain is usually controlled with standard analgesics.
Adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class.
Frequency groupings are defined according to the following convention:
Very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000), very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

In randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies, filgrastim did not increase the incidence of undesirable effects associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Undesirable effects reported with equal frequency in patients treated with filgrastim/ chemotherapy and placebo/ chemotherapy included nausea and vomiting, alopecia, diarrhoea, fatigue, anorexia, mucositis, headache, cough, skin rash, chest pain, generalised weakness, sore throat, constipation and unspecified pain.
Allergic reactions occurred on initial or subsequent treatment in patients receiving filgrastim.
Overall, reports were more common after intravenous administration.
In some cases, symptoms have recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship.
Filgrastim should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction.
Vascular disorders have been reported in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation.
The causal association with filgrastim has not been established.
Pulmonary adverse reactions have in some cases been reported with an outcome of respiratory failure or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal.
In normal donors, pulmonary adverse events (haemoptysis, pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary infiltrates, dyspnoea and hypoxia) have been reported very rarely in post marketing experience (see section 4.4).
The occurrence of Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) has been reported occasionally in cancer patients.
However, since a significant percentage of these patients were
12 suffering from leukaemia, a condition known to be associated with Sweet's syndrome, a causal relationship with filgrastim has not been established.
Isolated cases of sickle cells crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell disease (see section 4.4).
The frequency is not known.
In all cases of splenic enlargement in HIV patients this was mild or moderate on physical examination and the clinical course was benign; no patients had a diagnosis of hypersplenism and no patients underwent splenectomy.
As splenic enlargement is a common finding in patients with HIV infection and is present to varying degrees in most patients with AIDS, the relationship to filgrastim treatment is unclear.
Immunogenicity
In four clinical studies none of the healthy volunteers or cancer patients developed anti-rhG-CSF antibodies (neither binding nor neutralising) upon treatment with Zarzio.
4.9 Overdose
The effects of filgrastim overdose have not been established.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Colony stimulating factors, ATC Code:
L03AA02
Human G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow.
Zarzio containing r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes.
In some SCN patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment.
Elevations of neutrophil counts are dose-dependent at recommended doses.
Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function.
Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 - 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 - 7 days.
As with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human endothelial cells, which have specific receptors for G-CSF.
Accordingly, G-CSF has been shown to induce endothelial cell functions related to angiogenesis.
Additionally, G-CSF has been shown to increase neutrophil migration across the vascular endothelium.
Use of filgrastim in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to significant reductions in the incidence, severity and duration of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.
Treatment with filgrastim significantly reduces the duration of febrile neutropenia, antibiotic use and hospitalisation after induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation.
The incidence of fever and documented infections were not reduced in either setting.
The duration of fever was not reduced in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation.
Use of filgrastim, either alone, or after chemotherapy, mobilises haematopoietic progenitor cells into peripheral blood.
These autologous PBPCs may be harvested and infused after high-dose cytotoxic therapy, either in place of, or in addition to bone marrow transplantation.
Infusion of PBPCs accelerates haematopoietic recovery reducing the duration of risk for haemorrhagic complications and the need for platelet transfusions.
One retrospective European study evaluating the use of G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with acute leukaemias suggested an increase in the risk of GvHD, treatment
13 related mortality (TRM) and mortality when G-CSF was administered.
In a separate retrospective international study in patients with acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, no effect on the risk of GvHD, TRM and mortality was seen.
A meta-analysis of allogeneic transplant studies, including the results of nine prospective randomized trials, 8 retrospective studies and 1 case-controlled study, did not detect an effect on the risks of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD or early treatment-related mortality.

Use of filgrastim for the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation In normal donors, a 1 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day) dose administered subcutaneously for 4 - 5 consecutive days allows a collection of ≥ 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/ kg recipient BW in the majority of the donors after two leukaphereses.
Recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim experienced significantly more rapid haematological recovery, leading to a significant decrease in time to unsupported platelet recovery when compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
Use of filgrastim in children or adults with SCN (severe congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia) induces a sustained increase in ACNs in peripheral blood and a reduction of infection and related events.
Use of filgrastim in patients with HIV infection maintains normal neutrophil counts to allow scheduled dosing of antiviral and/ or other myelosuppressive treatments.
There is no evidence that patients with HIV infection treated with filgrastim show an increase in HIV replication.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Randomised, double-blind, single and multiple dose, crossover studies in 146 healthy volunteers showed that the pharmacokinetic profile of Zarzio was comparable to that of the reference product after subcutaneous and intravenous administration.
Absorption
A single subcutaneous dose of 0.5 MU/ kg (5 µg/ kg) resulted in maximum serum concentrations after a tmax of 4.5 ± 0.9 hours (mean ± SD).
Distribution
The volume of distribution in blood is approximately 150 ml/ kg.
Following subcutaneous administration of recommended doses, serum concentrations were maintained above 10 ng/ ml for 8 - 16 hours.
There is a positive linear correlation between the dose and the serum concentration of filgrastim, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
14 Elimination
The elimination of filgrastim is non-linear with respect to dose, the serum clearance decreases with increasing dose.
Filgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, which becomes saturated at higher doses.
However, the serum clearance increases with repeated dosing while the neutrophil count increases.
The median serum elimination half-life (t1/ 2) of filgrastim after single subcutaneous doses ranged from 2.7 hours (1.0 MU/ kg, 10 µg/ kg) to 5.7 hours (0.25 MU/ kg, 2.5 µg/ kg) and was prolonged after 7 days of dosing to 8.5 - 14 hours, respectively.
Continuous infusion with filgrastim over a period of up to 28 days, in patients recovering from autologous bone-marrow transplantation, resulted in no evidence of drug accumulation and comparable elimination half-lives.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
There are no preclinical data of relevance to the prescriber which are additional to that already included in other sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
- Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients
treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.
- Mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC).
- In children and adults with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/ l, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration of filgrastim is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events.
- Treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC ≤ 1.0 x 109/ l) in patients with advanced HIV
infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other therapeutic options are inappropriate.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Filgrastim therapy should only be given in collaboration with an oncology centre which has experience in granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment and haematology and has the necessary diagnostic facilities.
18 The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration with an oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the monitoring of haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed.
Zarzio is available in strengths of 30 MU/ 0.5 ml and 48 MU/ 0.5 ml.
Established cytotoxic chemotherapy
The recommended dose of filgrastim is 0.5 MU/ kg/ day (5 μ g/ kg/ day).
The first dose of filgrastim should not be administered less than 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Daily dosing with filgrastim should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range.
Following established chemotherapy for solid tumours, lymphomas, and lymphoid leukaemias, it is expected that the duration of treatment required to fulfil these criteria will be up to 14 days.
Following induction and consolidation treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia the duration of treatment may be substantially longer (up to 38 days) depending on the type, dose and schedule of cytotoxic chemotherapy used.
In patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, a transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen 1 - 2 days after initiation of filgrastim therapy.
However, for a sustained therapeutic response, filgrastim therapy should not be discontinued before the expected nadir has passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range.
Premature discontinuation of filgrastim therapy, prior to the time of the expected neutrophil nadir, is not recommended.
Patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation The recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 1.0 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day).
The first dose of filgrastim should not be administered less than 24 hours following cytotoxic chemotherapy and within 24 hours of bone marrow infusion.
Dose adjustments:
Once the neutrophil nadir has been passed, the daily dose of filgrastim should be titrated against the neutrophil response as follows:
Absolute neutrophil count ANC > 1.0 x 109/ l for 3 consecutive days Then, if ANC remains > 1.0 x 109/ l for 3 more consecutive days
Filgrastim dose adjustment Reduce to 0.5 MU/ kg/ day (5 μ g/ kg/ day) Discontinue filgrastim
If the ANC decreases to < 1.0 x 109/ l during the treatment period, the dose of filgrastim should be re-escalated according to the above steps
Mobilisation of PBPC
Patients undergoing myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC transplantation The recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation when used alone is 1.0 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day) for 5 - 7 consecutive days.
Timing of leukapheresis:
1 or 2 leukaphereses on days 5 and 6 are often sufficient.
In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses may be necessary.
Filgrastim dosing should be maintained until the last leukapheresis.
The recommended dose of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation after myelosuppressive chemotherapy is 0.5 MU/ kg/ day (5 μ g/ kg/ day) given daily from the first day after completion of chemotherapy until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range.
Leukapheresis should be performed during the period when the ANC rises from< 0.5 x 109/l to > 5.0 x 109/l.
For patients who have not had extensive chemotherapy, one leukapheresis is often sufficient.
In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses are recommended.
There are no prospectively randomised comparisons of the two recommended mobilisation methods (filgrastim alone or in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy) within the same patient population.
The degree of variation between individual patients and between laboratory assays of
19 CD34+ cells means that direct comparison between different studies is difficult.
It is therefore difficult to recommend an optimum method.
The choice of mobilisation method should be considered in relation to the overall objectives of treatment for an individual patient.
Normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation For PBPC mobilisation in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation, filgrastim should be administered at 1.0 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day) for 4 - 5 consecutive days.
Leukapheresis should be started at day 5 and continued until day 6 if needed in order to collect 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/ kg recipient bodyweight (BW).
Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN)
Congenital neutropenia The recommended starting dose is 1.2 MU/ kg/ day (12 μ g/ kg/ day) as a single dose or in divided doses.
Idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia The recommended starting dose is 0.5 MU/ kg/ day (5 μ g/ kg/ day) as a single dose or in divided doses.
Dose adjustments Filgrastim should be administered daily until the neutrophil count has reached and can be maintained at more than 1.5 x 109/ l.
When the response has been obtained, the minimal effective dose to maintain this level should be established.
Long-term daily administration is required to maintain an adequate neutrophil count.
After 1 - 2 weeks of therapy, the initial dose may be doubled or halved depending upon the patient's response.
Subsequently the dose may be individually adjusted every 1 - 2 weeks to maintain the average neutrophil count between 1.5 x 109/ l and 10 x 109/ l.
A faster schedule of dose escalation may be considered in patients presenting with severe infections.
In clinical studies, 97% of patients who responded had a complete response at doses of ≤ 2.4 MU/ kg/ day (24 μ g/ kg/ day).
The long-term safety of filgrastim administration above 2.4 MU/ kg/ day (24 μ g/ kg/ day) in patients with SCN has not been established.
HIV infection
Reversal of neutropenia The recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 0.1 MU/ kg/ day (1 μ g/ kg/ day) given daily with titration up to a maximum of 0.4 MU/ kg/ day (4 μ g/ kg/ day) until a normal neutrophil count is reached and can be maintained (ANC > 2.0 x 109/ l).
In clinical studies, > 90% of patients responded at these doses, achieving reversal of neutropenia in a median of 2 days.
In a small number of patients (< 10%), doses up to 1.0 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day) were required to achieve reversal of neutropenia.
Maintenance of normal neutrophil counts When reversal of neutropenia has been achieved, the minimal effective dose to maintain a normal neutrophil count should be established.
Initial dose adjustment to alternate day dosing with 30 MU/ day (300 μ g/ day) is recommended.
Further dose adjustment may be necessary, as determined by the patient's ANC, to maintain the neutrophil count at > 2.0 x 109/ l.
In clinical studies, dosing with 30 MU/ day (300 μ g/ day) on 1 - 7 days per week was required to maintain the ANC > 2.0 x 109/ l, with the median dose frequency being 3 days per week.
Long-term administration may be required to maintain the ANC > 2.0 x 109/ l.
Special populations
Patients with renal/ hepatic impairment Studies of filgrastim in patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function demonstrate that it exhibits a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to that seen in normal individuals.
Dose adjustment is not required in these circumstances.
20 Paediatric patients in the SCN and cancer settings In clinical studies 65% of patients treated for SCN were younger than 18 years.
For this age-group, which mostly includes patients with congenital neutropenia, efficacy was proven.
There were no differences in the safety profiles for paediatric patients treated for SCN in comparison to adults.
Data from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are similar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.
The dosage recommendations in paediatric patients are the same as those in adults receiving myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Elderly patients In clinical investigations with filgrastim a small number of elderly patients was included.
No specific studies have been performed for this patient population.
Therefore, specific posology recommendations for these patients cannot be made.
Method of administration
Established cytotoxic chemotherapy Filgrastim may be administered as a daily subcutaneous injection or alternatively as a daily intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.
For further instructions on dilution with glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution prior to infusion see section 6.6.
The subcutaneous route is preferred in most cases.
There is some evidence from a study of single dose administration that intravenous dosing may shorten the duration of effect.
The clinical relevance of this finding to multiple dose administration is not clear.
The choice of route should depend on the individual clinical circumstance.
In randomised clinical studies, a subcutaneous dose of 23 MU/ m2/ day (230 μ g/ m2/ day) or rather 0.4 - 0.84 MU/ kg/ day (4 - 8.4 μ g/ kg/ day) was used.
Patients treated with myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation Filgrastim is administered as an intravenous short-term infusion over 30 minutes or as a subcutaneous or intravenous continuous infusion over 24 hours, in each case after dilution in 20 ml of glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution.
For further instructions on dilution with glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution prior to infusion see section 6.6.
Mobilisation of PBPC Subcutaneous injection.
For the mobilisation of PBPC in patients undergoing myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapy followed by autologous PBPC transplantation the recommended dose of filgrastim may also be administered as a 24 hour subcutaneous continuous infusion.
For infusions filgrastim should be diluted in 20 ml of glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution.
For further instructions on dilution with glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution prior to infusion see section 6.6.
SCN/ HIV infection Subcutaneous injection.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Special warnings
Filgrastim should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established posology regimens (see below).
21 Filgrastim should not be administered to patients with severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome) with abnormal cytogenetics (see below).
Established cytotoxic chemotherapy
Malignant cell growth Since investigations showed that G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro the following warnings should be considered.
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, or chronic myelogenous leukaemia have not been established.
Therefore filgrastim is not indicated for use in these conditions.
Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from acute myeloid leukaemia.
In view of limited safety and efficacy data in patients with secondary AML, filgrastim should be administered with caution.
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged < 55 years with good cytogenetics [t(8; 21), t(15; 17), and inv(16)] have not been established.
Leucocytosis White blood cell counts of 100 x 109/ l or greater have been observed in less than 5% of patients receiving filgrastim at doses above 0.3 MU/ kg/ day (3 μ g/ kg/ day).
No undesirable effects directly attributable to this degree of leucocytosis have been reported.
However, in view of the potential risks associated with severe leucocytosis, a white blood cell count should be performed at regular intervals during filgrastim therapy.
If leukocyte counts exceed 50 x 109/ l after the expected nadir, filgrastim should be discontinued immediately.
However, during the period of administration of filgrastim for PBPC mobilisation, it should be discontinued or its dose should be reduced if the leukocyte counts rise to > 70 x 109/ l.
Risks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy Special caution should be used when treating patients with high-dose chemotherapy because improved tumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic agents may lead to increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, and dermatologic effects (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics of the specific chemotherapy agents used).
Treatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
Because of the potential of receiving higher doses of chemotherapy (e. g. full doses on the prescribed schedule) the patient may be at greater risk of thrombocytopenia and anaemia.
Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended.
Special care should be taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia.
The use of filgrastim-mobilised PBPCs has been shown to reduce the depth and duration of thrombocytopenia following myelosuppressive or myeloablative chemotherapy.
Other special precautions The effects of filgrastim in patients with substantially reduced myeloid progenitors have not been studied.
Filgrastim acts primarily on neutrophil precursors to exert its effect in elevating neutrophil counts.
Therefore, in patients with reduced precursors, neutrophil response may be diminished (such as those treated with extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or those with bone marrow infiltration by tumour).
There have been reports of Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see section 5.1).
22 Mobilisation of PBPC
Prior exposure to cytotoxic agents Patients who have undergone very extensive prior myelosuppressive therapy, followed by administration of filgrastim for mobilisation of PBPCs, may not show sufficient mobilisation of these blood cells to achieve the recommended minimum yield (≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/ kg) or acceleration of platelet recovery to the same degree.
Some cytotoxic agents exhibit particular toxicities to the haematopoietic progenitor pool and may adversely affect progenitor mobilisation.
Agents such as melphalan, carmustine (BCNU) and carboplatin, when administered over prolonged periods prior to attempts at progenitor mobilisation may reduce progenitor yield.
However, the administration of melphalan, carboplatin or BCNU together with filgrastim has been shown to be effective for progenitor mobilisation.
When a PBPC transplantation is envisaged it is advisable to plan the stem cell mobilisation procedure early in the treatment course of the patient.
Particular attention should be paid to the number of progenitors mobilised in such patients before the administration of high-dose chemotherapy.
If yields are inadequate, as measured by the criteria above, alternative forms of treatment not requiring progenitor support should be considered.
Assessment of progenitor cell yields In assessing the number of progenitor cells harvested in patients treated with filgrastim, particular attention should be paid to the method of quantitation.
The results of flow cytometric analysis of CD34+ cell numbers vary depending on the precise methodology used and therefore, recommendations of numbers based on studies in other laboratories need to be interpreted with caution.
Statistical analysis of the relationship between the number of CD34+ cells re-infused and the rate of platelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy indicates a complex but continuous relationship.
The recommendation of a minimum yield of ≥ 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/ kg is based on published experience resulting in adequate haematologic reconstitution.
Yields in excess of this minimum yield appear to correlate with more rapid recovery, those below with slower recovery.
Normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation Mobilisation of PBPC does not provide a direct clinical benefit to normal donors and should only be considered for the purposes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
PBPC mobilisation should be considered only in donors who meet normal clinical and laboratory eligibility criteria for stem cell donation with special attention to haematological values and infectious disease.
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim have not been assessed in normal donors< 16 years or > 60 years.
Transient thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 109/ l) following filgrastim administration and leukapheresis was observed in 35% of subjects studied.
Among these, two cases of platelets < 50 x 109/ l were reported and attributed to the leukapheresis procedure.
If more than one leukapheresis is required, particular attention should be paid to donors with platelets < 100 x 109/ l prior to leukapheresis; in general apheresis should not be performed if platelets < 75 x 109/ l.
Leukapheresis should not be performed in donors who are anticoagulated or who have known defects in haemostasis.
Filgrastim administration should be discontinued or its posology should be reduced if the leukocyte counts rise to > 70 x 109/ l.
Donors who receive G-CSFs for PBPC mobilisation should be monitored until haematological indices return to normal.
Long-term safety follow-up of donors is ongoing.
For up to 4 years, there have been no reports of abnormal haematopoiesis in normal donors.
Nevertheless, a risk of promotion of a
23 malignant myeloid clone can not be excluded.
It is recommended that the apheresis centre perform a systematic record and tracking of the stem cell donors to ensure monitoring of long-term safety.
Transient cytogenic modifications have been observed in normal donors following G-CSF use.
The significance of these changes in terms of the development of haematological malignancy is unknown.
Common but generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and very rare cases of splenic rupture have been reported in healthy donors and patients following administration of G-CSFs.
Some cases of splenic rupture were fatal.
Therefore, spleen size should be carefully monitored (e. g. clinical examination, ultrasound).
A diagnosis of splenic rupture should be considered in donors and/ or patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip pain.
In normal donors, pulmonary adverse events (haemoptysis, pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary infiltrates, dyspnoea and hypoxia) have been reported very rarely in post marketing experience.
In case of suspected or confirmed pulmonary adverse events, discontinuation of treatment with filgrastim should be considered and appropriate medical care given.
Recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim Current data indicate that immunological interactions between the allogeneic PBPC graft and the recipient may be associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD when compared with bone marrow transplantation.
SCN
Blood cell counts Platelet counts should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy.
Consideration should be given to intermittent cessation or decreasing the dose of filgrastim in patients who develop thrombocytopenia, i. e. platelets consistently < 100,000/ mm3.
Other blood cell changes occur, including anaemia and transient increases in myeloid progenitors, which require close monitoring of cell counts.
Transformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome Special care should be taken in the diagnosis of SCNs to distinguish them from other haematopoietic disorders such as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia, and myeloid leukaemia.
Complete blood cell counts with differential and platelet counts, and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and karyotype should be performed prior to treatment.
There was a low frequency (approximately 3%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukaemia in clinical study patients with SCN treated with filgrastim.
This observation has only been made in patients with congenital neutropenia.
MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease and are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy.
A subset of approximately 12% of patients who had normal cytogenetic evaluations at baseline were subsequently found to have abnormalities, including monosomy 7, on routine repeat evaluation.
If patients with SCN develop abnormal cytogenetics, the risks and benefits of continuing filgrastim should be carefully weighed; Filgrastim should be discontinued if MDS or leukaemia occurs.
It is currently unclear whether long-term treatment of patients with SCN will predispose patients to cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic transformation.
It is recommended to perform morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow examinations in patients at regular intervals (approximately every 12 months).
Other special precautions Causes of transient neutropenia, such as viral infections should be excluded.
Splenic enlargement is a direct effect of treatment with filgrastim.
31% of patients in studies were documented as having palpable splenomegaly.
Increases in volume, measured radiographically, occurred early during Filgrastim therapy and tended to plateau.
Dose reductions were noted to slow or stop the progression of splenic enlargement, and in 3% of patients a splenectomy was required.
Spleen size should be evaluated regularly.
Abdominal palpation should be sufficient to detect abnormal increases in splenic volume.
24 Haematuria/ proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients.
Regular urine analyses should be performed to monitor this event.
The safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia have not been established.
HIV infection
Blood cell counts ANC should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks of filgrastim therapy.
Some patients may respond very rapidly and with a considerable increase in neutrophil count to the initial dose of filgrastim.
It is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for the first 2 - 3 days of filgrastim administration.
Thereafter, it is recommended that the ANC is measured at least twice per week for the first 2 weeks and subsequently once per week or once every other week during maintenance therapy.
During intermittent dosing with 30 MU/ day (300 μ g/ day) of filgrastim, there can be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time.
In order to determine a patient's trough or nadir ANC, it is recommended that blood samples are taken for ANC measurement immediately prior to any scheduled dosing with filgrastim.
Risk associated with increased doses of myelosuppressive medicinal products Treatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to myelosuppressive treatments.
As a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater number of these medicinal products with filgrastim therapy, the patient may be at higher risk of developing thrombocytopenia and anaemia.
Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended (see above).
Infections and malignancies causing myelosuppression Neutropenia may be due to bone marrow-infiltrating opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex or malignancies such as lymphoma.
In patients with known bone marrow-infiltrating infections or malignancy, consider appropriate therapy for treatment of the underlying condition in addition to administration of filgrastim for treatment of neutropenia.
The effects of filgrastim on neutropenia due to bone marrow-infiltrating infection or malignancy have not been well established.
Other special precautions
Rare pulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF administration (see section 4.8).
Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher risk.
The onset of pulmonary signs, such as cough, fever and dyspnoea in association with radiological signs of pulmonary infiltrates and deterioration in pulmonary function may be preliminary signs of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
Filgrastim should be discontinued and appropriate treatment given in these cases.
Monitoring of bone density may be indicated in patients with underlying osteoporotic bone diseases who undergo continuous therapy with filgrastim for more than 6 months.
Sickle cells crises, in some cases fatal, have been reported with the use of filgrastim in subjects with sickle cell disease.
Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of filgrastim in patients with sickle cell disease, and only after careful evaluation of the potential risks and benefits.
Increased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging findings.
This should be considered when interpreting bone imaging results.
Excipients
Zarzio contains sorbitol.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not use this medicinal product.
25 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The safety and efficacy of filgrastim given on the same day as myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been definitively established.
In view of the sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of filgrastim is not recommended in the period from 24 hours before to 24 hours after chemotherapy.
Preliminary evidence from a small number of patients treated concomitantly with filgrastim and 5-fluorouracil indicates that the severity of neutropenia may be exacerbated.
Possible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not yet been investigated in clinical studies.
Since lithium promotes the release of neutrophils, lithium is likely to potentiate the effect of filgrastim.
Although this interaction has not been formally investigated, there is no evidence that such an interaction is harmful.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data from the use of filgrastim in pregnant women.
There are reports in the literature where the transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women has been demonstrated.
There is no evidence from studies in rats and rabbits that filgrastim is teratogenic.
An increased incidence of embryo-loss has been observed in rabbits, but no malformation has been seen.
In pregnancy, the possible risk of filgrastim use to the foetus must be weighed against the expected therapeutic benefit.
It is not known whether filgrastim is excreted in human milk, therefore it is not recommended for use in breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Filgrastim has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most commonly reported adverse reactions to filgrastim are mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain occurring in more than 10% of patients.
Musculoskeletal pain is usually controlled with standard analgesics.
Adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class.
Frequency groupings are defined according to the following convention:
Very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000), very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

In randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies, filgrastim did not increase the incidence of undesirable effects associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Undesirable effects reported with equal frequency in patients treated with filgrastim/ chemotherapy and placebo/ chemotherapy included nausea and vomiting, alopecia, diarrhoea, fatigue, anorexia, mucositis, headache, cough, skin rash, chest pain, generalised weakness, sore throat, constipation and unspecified pain.
Allergic reactions occurred on initial or subsequent treatment in patients receiving filgrastim.
Overall, reports were more common after intravenous administration.
In some cases, symptoms have recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship.
Filgrastim should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction.
Vascular disorders have been reported in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation.
The causal association with filgrastim has not been established.
Pulmonary adverse reactions have in some cases been reported with an outcome of respiratory failure or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal.
In normal donors, pulmonary adverse events (haemoptysis, pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary infiltrates, dyspnoea and hypoxia) have been reported very rarely in post marketing experience (see section 4.4).
The occurrence of Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) has been reported occasionally in cancer patients.
However, since a significant percentage of these patients were
28 suffering from leukaemia, a condition known to be associated with Sweet's syndrome, a causal relationship with filgrastim has not been established.
Isolated cases of sickle cells crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell disease (see section 4.4).
The frequency is not known.
In all cases of splenic enlargement in HIV patients this was mild or moderate on physical examination and the clinical course was benign; no patients had a diagnosis of hypersplenism and no patients underwent splenectomy.
As splenic enlargement is a common finding in patients with HIV infection and is present to varying degrees in most patients with AIDS, the relationship to filgrastim treatment is unclear.
Immunogenicity
In four clinical studies none of the healthy volunteers or cancer patients developed anti-rhG-CSF antibodies (neither binding nor neutralising) upon treatment with Zarzio.
4.9 Overdose
The effects of filgrastim overdose have not been established.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Colony stimulating factors, ATC Code:
L03AA02
Human G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow.
Zarzio containing r-metHuG-CSF (filgrastim) causes marked increases in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes.
In some SCN patients filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to treatment.
Elevations of neutrophil counts are dose-dependent at recommended doses.
Neutrophils produced in response to filgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and phagocytic function.
Following termination of filgrastim therapy, circulating neutrophil counts decrease by 50% within 1 - 2 days, and to normal levels within 1 - 7 days.
As with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro stimulating properties on human endothelial cells, which have specific receptors for G-CSF.
Accordingly, G-CSF has been shown to induce endothelial cell functions related to angiogenesis.
Additionally, G-CSF has been shown to increase neutrophil migration across the vascular endothelium.
Use of filgrastim in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to significant reductions in the incidence, severity and duration of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.
Treatment with filgrastim significantly reduces the duration of febrile neutropenia, antibiotic use and hospitalisation after induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia or myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation.
The incidence of fever and documented infections were not reduced in either setting.
The duration of fever was not reduced in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation.
Use of filgrastim, either alone, or after chemotherapy, mobilises haematopoietic progenitor cells into peripheral blood.
These autologous PBPCs may be harvested and infused after high-dose cytotoxic therapy, either in place of, or in addition to bone marrow transplantation.
Infusion of PBPCs accelerates haematopoietic recovery reducing the duration of risk for haemorrhagic complications and the need for platelet transfusions.
One retrospective European study evaluating the use of G-CSF after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients with acute leukaemias suggested an increase in the risk of GvHD, treatment
29 related mortality (TRM) and mortality when G-CSF was administered.
In a separate retrospective international study in patients with acute and chronic myelogenous leukaemias, no effect on the risk of GvHD, TRM and mortality was seen.
A meta-analysis of allogeneic transplant studies, including the results of nine prospective randomized trials, 8 retrospective studies and 1 case-controlled study, did not detect an effect on the risks of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD or early treatment-related mortality.

Use of filgrastim for the mobilisation of PBPCs in normal donors prior to allogeneic PBPC transplantation In normal donors, a 1 MU/ kg/ day (10 μ g/ kg/ day) dose administered subcutaneously for 4 - 5 consecutive days allows a collection of ≥ 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/ kg recipient BW in the majority of the donors after two leukaphereses.
Recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim experienced significantly more rapid haematological recovery, leading to a significant decrease in time to unsupported platelet recovery when compared with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
Use of filgrastim in children or adults with SCN (severe congenital, cyclic, and idiopathic neutropenia) induces a sustained increase in ACNs in peripheral blood and a reduction of infection and related events.
Use of filgrastim in patients with HIV infection maintains normal neutrophil counts to allow scheduled dosing of antiviral and/ or other myelosuppressive treatments.
There is no evidence that patients with HIV infection treated with filgrastim show an increase in HIV replication.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Randomised, double-blind, single and multiple dose, crossover studies in 146 healthy volunteers showed that the pharmacokinetic profile of Zarzio was comparable to that of the reference product after subcutaneous and intravenous administration.
Absorption
A single subcutaneous dose of 0.5 MU/ kg (5 µg/ kg) resulted in maximum serum concentrations after a tmax of 4.5 ± 0.9 hours (mean ± SD).
Distribution
The volume of distribution in blood is approximately 150 ml/ kg.
Following subcutaneous administration of recommended doses, serum concentrations were maintained above 10 ng/ ml for 8 - 16 hours.
There is a positive linear correlation between the dose and the serum concentration of filgrastim, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
30 Elimination
The elimination of filgrastim is non-linear with respect to dose, the serum clearance decreases with increasing dose.
Filgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil mediated clearance, which becomes saturated at higher doses.
However, the serum clearance increases with repeated dosing while the neutrophil count increases.
The median serum elimination half-life (t1/ 2) of filgrastim after single subcutaneous doses ranged from 2.7 hours (1.0 MU/ kg, 10 µg/ kg) to 5.7 hours (0.25 MU/ kg, 2.5 µg/ kg) and was prolonged after 7 days of dosing to 8.5 - 14 hours, respectively.
Continuous infusion with filgrastim over a period of up to 28 days, in patients recovering from autologous bone-marrow transplantation, resulted in no evidence of drug accumulation and comparable elimination half-lives.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
There are no preclinical data of relevance to the prescriber which are additional to that already included in other sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Further information
1.
WHAT ZARZIO IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Zarzio contains the active substance filgrastim.
It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very similar to the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) produced by the human body.
Filgrastim stimulates the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells that help fight infection.
If the number of white blood cells is too low (neutropenia), the risk of infection increases.
Anticancer chemotherapy
Zarzio is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia (with fever) which can be caused by the use of cytotoxic anticancer chemotherapy in children and adults.
It is not used in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Bone marrow transplantation
Zarzio is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia after high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation (radiotherapy) followed by bone marrow transplantation, in children and adults at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia.
Peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation
Zarzio is used to stimulate the bone marrow to release (mobilisation) peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC, a type of stem cells) into the blood, so that they eventually grow and develop into all types of blood cells: white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.
If you are a patient with cancer these PBPCs will be removed from your blood and returned after your chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy.
As chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy can depress the activity of your bone marrow, this will help to speed up its recovery.
If you donate stem cells for another person, the PBPCs will be removed from your blood and given to the recipient after he/ she has received their chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy.
52 Severe chronic neutropenia
Zarzio is used in children and adults to increase the number of white blood cells and reduce the occurrence and duration of infections related to specific forms of severe chronic neutropenia: congenital (inborn), cyclic (recurring), or idiopathic (without known cause).
HIV infection neutropenia
Zarzio is used to treat persistent neutropenia in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections, when other treatments are not appropriate.
2.
BEFORE YOU USE ZARZIO
Do not use Zarzio
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to filgrastim or to any of the other ingredients of Zarzio
(listed in section 6. ‘ What Zarzio contains’).
Take special care with Zarzio Please tell your doctor:
- if you have osteoporosis.
- if you have sickle cell anaemia (disorder of the red blood cells leading to a sickle-shaped form
of the red blood cells).
- if you have specific blood disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic
myeloid leukaemia (CML).
- if you act as a donor for another person and are treated with anticoagulants (blood thinning
medicines) or you have bleeding problems.
Using other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or plan to get pregnant, as the doctor may decide that you should not use this medicine.
Filgrastim could affect your ability to become or stay pregnant.
Your doctor may decide that you should not use filgrastim if you are breast-feeding, as it is not known whether it passes into milk.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines Zarzio has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Important information about some of the ingredients of Zarzio This medicine contains sorbitol (a type of sugar).
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
3.
HOW TO USE ZARZIO
The amount of Zarzio you need depends on your bodyweight and the condition you are treated for.
Anticancer chemotherapy
The usual dose is 0.5 million units (MU) per kg bodyweight each day.
For example, if you weigh 60 kg, your daily dose will be 30 MU.
The first dose should not be administered less than 24 hours
53 following cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Your treatment can last up to 14 days.
In some disease types, however, longer treatment of up to about 1 month may be required.
Bone marrow transplantation
The usual starting dose is 1 MU per kg bodyweight each day.
For example, if you weigh 60 kg, your daily dose will be 60 MU.
You will normally receive your first dose at least 24 hours after your chemotherapy, but within 24 hours of receiving your bone marrow transfusion.
Your doctor will then test your blood to tell how well your treatment is working and how long it should last.
Peripheral blood stem cell mobilisation
- If you are donating stem cells for yourself, the usual dose is 1 MU per kg bodyweight each day.
Zarzio will be given for 5 - 7 consecutive days.
Treatment with Zarzio should be maintained until the last stem cell collection.
- If you are donating stem cells for yourself after chemotherapy, the usual dose is
0.5 MU per kg bodyweight each day.
Zarzio will be given until the expected lowest level of white blood cells is passed and has recovered to the normal range.
- If you are acting as a stem cell donor for another person, the usual dose is
1 MU per kg bodyweight each day.
Zarzio treatment will last for 4 - 5 consecutive days.
Your doctor will perform regular blood tests to determine the best time to collect the stem cells.
Severe chronic neutropenia
The usual starting dose is between 0.5 and 1.2 MU per kg bodyweight each day in a single or divided dose.
Your doctor will then test your blood to see how well your treatment is working and to find the dose that is best for you.
Long-term treatment with Zarzio is required for neutropenia.
HIV infection neutropenia
The usual starting dose is between 0.1 and 0.4 MU per kg bodyweight each day.
Your doctor will test your blood at regular intervals to see how well the treatment is working.
Once the number of white cells in your blood have returned to normal it may be possible to reduce the dose frequency to less than once per day.
Your doctor will continue to test your blood regularly and will recommend the best dose for you.
Long-term treatment with Zarzio may be required to maintain a normal number of white cells in your blood.
Children and adolescents
The dose recommendations are the same as those for adults receiving chemotherapy.
How Zarzio is used Always use Zarzio exactly as your doctor has told you.
You should check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure.
This medicine is given by injection into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection), or through an intravenous infusion (“ a drip”).
Your doctor may decide that it would be more convenient for you to inject Zarzio yourself.
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject yourself.
Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained.
Instructions on how to inject yourself with Zarzio can be found at the end of this leaflet.
If you use more Zarzio than you should
If you have used more Zarzio than you should, contact your nurse, doctor or pharmacist immediately.
54 If you forget to use Zarzio
If you have forgotten a dose of Zarzio, you should contact your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose.
If you stop using Zarzio
Your doctor will tell you when you can stop using Zarzio.
It is quite normal to have several courses of treatment with Zarzio.
4.

Instructions on how to inject yourself
This section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Zarzio.
It is important that you do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor or nurse.
Zarzio is provided with or without a needle safety guard and you will be shown how to use this by your doctor or nurse.
If you are not sure about giving the injection or you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse for help.
How do I inject myself?
You will need to give yourself an injection into the tissue under the skin, known as a subcutaneous injection.
Your doctor or nurse will tell you how frequently it should be injected.
What do I need?
To give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need:
1.
A new pre-filled syringe of Zarzio with or without a needle safety guard 2.
Alcohol wipes or similar 3.
A puncture-proof container for disposing of used syringes safely if you use the Zarzio pre-filled syringe without a needle safety guard.
What should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Zarzio?
1.
Take your Zarzio pack out of the refrigerator.
Accidental exposure to freezing temperatures does not adversely affect the stability of Zarzio.
2.
Do not shake the packing containing the pre-filled syringe.
3.
Check that it is the correct strength you need for the dose that your doctor has prescribed.
4.
Check the expiry date which is stated on the carton and syringe label (EXP).
Do not use it if the date has passed the last day of the month shown.
5.
Check the appearance of Zarzio.
It must be clear.
If it is cloudy or there are particles in it, you must not use it.
6.
For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room temperature or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes.
Do not warm Zarzio in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water).
7.
Do not remove the plastic cover from the needle until you are ready to inject.
8.
Wash your hands thoroughly.
9.
Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put the syringe, the alcohol wipes and if necessary the puncture-proof container where you can reach them.
How do I prepare the injection?
Before you inject Zarzio you must do the following:
1.
Gently remove the plastic cover from the needle without twisting it.
Do not touch the needle or push the plunger.
2.
Hold the syringe with the needle pointing upwards to check if there are air bubbles in the syringe.
If there are air bubbles in it expel all air from the syringe by cautiously pushing the plunger upwards (avoid expelling liquid from the syringe).
59 3.
The syringe has a scale on the syringe barrel.
Push the plunger up to the number (ml) that matches the dose of Zarzio that your doctor prescribed.
4.
Check again to make sure the correct dose of Zarzio is in the syringe.
5.
You can now use the pre-filled syringe.
Where should I give my injection?
The most suitable places to inject yourself are:
- The top of your thighs; and
- The abdomen, except for the area around the navel.
Change the place that you inject each time so you don’ t become sore in one area.
If someone is injecting for you, they can also use the back of your arms.
How do I give my injection?
1.
Disinfect your skin by using an alcohol wipe and pinch the skin between your thumb and forefinger, without squeezing it.
2.
Insert the needle under the skin at an angle of approximately 45° as shown by your nurse or doctor.
3.
Pull slightly on the plunger to check that a blood vessel has not been punctured.
If you see blood in the syringe, remove the needle and put it in another place.
Pre-filled syringe without needle safety guard
4.
Always keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly.
5.
After injecting the liquid, remove the needle and let go of your skin.
6.
Put the used syringe in the disposal container.
Use each syringe only for one injection.
Pre-filled syringe with needle safety guard
4.
Always keeping your skin pinched, depress the plunger slowly and evenly until the entire dose has been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further.
Do not release the pressure on the plunger!
5.
After injecting the liquid, remove the needle while maintaining pressure on the plunger and then let go of your skin.
6.
Let go of the plunger.
The needle safety guard will rapidly move to cover the needle.
7.
Use each syringe only for one injection.
Remember
If you have any problems, please do not be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse for help and advice.
Disposal of used syringes
The used syringes should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
Pre-filled syringe without needle safety guard
- Do not put the cover back on used syringes.
- Put used syringes into the puncture-proof disposal container and keep it out of the reach and
sight of children.
- Dispose of the full container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
- NEVER put used syringes into your normal household waste bin.
60 Pre-filled syringe with needle safety guard
- The needle safety guard prevents needle stick injuries after use, so no special disposal
precautions are required.
Dispose of the syringe as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
The solution should be visually inspected prior to use.
Only clear solutions without particles should be used.
Accidental exposure to freezing temperatures does not adversely affect the stability of Zarzio.
Zarzio contains no preservative:
In view of the possible risk of microbial contamination, Zarzio syringes are for single use only.
Dilution prior to administration (optional)
If required, Zarzio may be diluted in glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution.
Zarzio must not be diluted with sodium chloride solutions.
Dilution to a final concentration < 0.2 MU/ ml (2 μ g/ ml) is not recommended at any time.
For patients treated with filgrastim diluted to concentrations < 1.5 MU/ ml (15 μ g/ ml), human serum albumin (HSA) should be added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ ml.
Example:
In a final volume of 20 ml, total doses of filgrastim less than 30 MU (300 μ g) should be given with 0.2 ml of human serum albumin 200 mg/ ml (20%) solution Ph.
Eur. added.
When diluted in glucose 50 mg/ ml (5%) solution, filgrastim is compatible with glass and a variety of plastics including polyvinylchloride, polyolefin (a copolymer of polypropylene and polyethylene) and polypropylene.
After dilution:
Chemical and physical in-use stability of the diluted solution for infusion has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C.
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately.
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.
Using the pre-filled syringe with a needle safety guard
The needle safety guard covers the needle after injection to prevent needle stick injury.
This does not affect normal operation of the syringe.
Depress the plunger slowly and evenly until the entire dose has been given and the plunger cannot be depressed any further.
While maintaining pressure on the plunger, remove the syringe from the patient.
The needle safety guard will cover the needle when releasing the plunger.
Using the pre-filled syringe without a needle safety guard
Administer the dose as per standard protocol.
Disposal
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
