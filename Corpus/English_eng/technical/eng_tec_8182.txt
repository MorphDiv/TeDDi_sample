CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST) SUTENT is indicated for the treatment of unresectable and/ or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) after failure of imatinib mesylate treatment due to resistance or intolerance.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (MRCC) SUTENT is indicated for the treatment of advanced and/ or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma or GIST.
The recommended dose of SUTENT is one 50 mg dose orally, taken daily for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period (schedule 4/ 2) to comprise a complete cycle of 6 weeks.
Dose adjustments Safety and Tolerability Dose modifications in 12.5-mg steps may be applied based on individual safety and tolerability.
Daily dose should not exceed 75 mg nor be decreased below 25 mg.
CYP3A4 Inhibitors/ Inducers Co-administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
If this is not possible, the dose of SUTENT may need to be increased in 12.5 mg increments (up to 87.5 mg per day) based on careful monitoring of tolerability.
Co-administration of SUTENT with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
If this is not possible the doses of SUTENT may need to be reduced to a minimum of 37.5 mg daily, based on careful monitoring of the tolerability.
Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to induce or inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered.
Paediatric use:
The safety and efficacy of SUTENT in paediatric patients have not been established.
2 SUTENT should not be used in paediatric population until further data become available.
Elderly patients use:
Approximately 34% of the subjects in clinical studies of SUTENT were 65 or over.
No significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between younger and older patients.
Hepatic Insufficiency:
No dose adjustment is recommended when administering SUTENT to patients with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh Class A and B) hepatic impairment.
SUTENT has not been studied in subjects with Child-Pugh Class C hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Renal Insufficiency:
No clinical studies have been performed in patients with impaired renal function.
(see section 5.2).
SUTENT may be taken with or without food.
If a dose is missed the patient should not be given an additional dose.
The patient should take the usual prescribed dose on the following day.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to sunitinib malate or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Co-administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations.
Combination with inducers should therefore be avoided.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be increased (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations.
Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential is recommended.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be reduced (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Skin and tissues Skin discolouration, possibly due to the active substance colour (yellow) is a common treatment-related adverse event occurring in approximately 30% of patients.
Patients should be advised that depigmentation of the hair or skin may also occur during treatment with SUTENT.
Other possible dermatologic effects may include dryness, thickness or cracking of the skin, blisters or occasional rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
Mouth pain/ irritation was reported in approximately 14% of patients.
Dysgeusia (taste disturbance) was reported in approximately 28% of patients.
The above events were not cumulative, were typically reversible and generally did not result in treatment discontinuation.
Haemorrhage Haemorrhagic events, some of which were fatal, reported through post-marketing experience, have included GI, respiratory, tumour, urinary tract and brain haemorrhages.
In clinical trials treatment-related tumour haemorrhage occurred in approximately 2% of patients with GIST.
These events may occur suddenly, and in the case of pulmonary tumours, may present as severe and life-threatening haemoptysis or pulmonary haemorrhage.
Fatal pulmonary haemorrhage occurred in 2 patients receiving SUTENT on a clinical trial of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Both patients had squamous cell histology.
SUTENT is not approved for use in patients with NSCLC.
Bleeding events occurred in 18% of patients receiving SUTENT in a phase 3 GIST Study compared to 17% of patients receiving placebo.
In patients receiving SUTENT for treatment-naïve MRCC, 28% had bleeding events compared to 7% of patients receiving IFN-α.
Seven (1.9%) patients on sunitinib malate versus 0% of patients on IFN-α experienced Grade 3 or greater treatment-related bleeding events.
Of patients receiving sunitinib malate for cytokine-
3 refractory MRCC, 26% experienced bleeding.
Routine assessment of this event should include complete blood counts and physical examination.
Epistaxis was the most common treatment-related haemorrhagic adverse event, having been reported for approximately half of the patients with solid tumours who experienced haemorrhagic events.
Some of these events were severe, but very rarely fatal.
Gastrointestinal events Nausea, diarrhoea, stomatitis, dyspepsia and vomiting were the most commonly reported treatment-related gastrointestinal events.
Supportive care for gastrointestinal adverse events requiring treatment may include medication with an anti- emetic or anti-diarrhoeal medication.
Gastrointestinal tract Serious, sometimes fatal gastrointestinal complications including gastrointestinal perforation have occurred rarely in patients with intra-abdominal malignancies treated with SUTENT.
Treatment-related fatal gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving placebo in the GIST Phase 3 study.
Hypertension Treatment-related hypertension was reported in approximately 16% of patients with solid tumours.
SUTENT dosing was reduced or temporarily delayed in approximately 2.7% of this patient population.
None of these patients were discontinued from treatment with SUTENT.
Severe hypertension (> 200 mmHg systolic or 110 mmHg diastolic) occurred in 4.7% of this patient population.
Treatment-related hypertension was reported in approximately 24% of patients receiving sunitinib malate for treatment-naïve MRCC compared to 1% of patients receiving IFN-α.
Severe hypertension occurred in 5% of treatment-naïve patients on sunitinib malate and 1% of patients on IFN-α.
Patients should be screened for hypertension and controlled as appropriate.
Temporary suspension is recommended in patients with severe hypertension that is not controlled with medical management.
Treatment may be resumed once hypertension is appropriately controlled.
Haematological Decreased absolute neutrophil counts of grade 3 and 4 severity were reported in 10% and 1.7% of patients on the phase 3 GIST study, respectively, and in 16% and 1.6% of patients on the phase 3 MRCC study, respectively.
Decreased platelet counts of grade 3 and 4 severity were reported in 3.7% and 0.4% of patientson the phase 3 GIST study, respectively, and in 8.2% and 1.1% of patients on the phase 3 MRCC study, respectively.
The above events were not cumulative, were typically reversible and generally did not result in treatment discontinuation.
None of these events in the phase 3 studies were fatal, but rare fatal haematological events have been reported through post-marketing experience.
Complete blood counts should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT.
Cardiovascular Cardiovascular events, some of which were fatal, reported through post-marketing experience, have included left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease and cardiac failure.
In clinical trials, decreases in LVEF of ≥ 20% and below the lower limit of normal occurred in approximately 2% of SUTENT-treated GIST patients, 4% of cytokine-refractory MRCC patients, 2% of placebo-treated patients.
These LVEF declines do not appear to have been progressive and often improved as treatment continued.
In the treatment-naïve MRCC study, 21% patients on SUTENT and 12% of patients on interferon-α (IFN-α), had an LVEF value below the lower limit of normal.
One (< 1%) patient who received SUTENT was diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF).
Treatment-related adverse events of ‘ cardiac failure’, ‘ cardiac failure congestive’ or ‘ left ventricular failure’ were reported in 0.7% of patients with solid tumours and 1% of patients treated with placebo.
All patients had GIST.
In the phase 3 GIST study (n=312), treatment-related fatal cardiac events occurred in 1% of patients on each arm of the study (i. e.
SUTENT and placebo arms).
In a phase 2 study in cytokine-refractory MRCC patients, 0.9% of patients experienced treatment-related fatal myocardial infarction and in the phase 3 study in treatment-naïve MRCC patients, 0.6% of patients on the IFN-α arm and 0 patients on the
4 SUTENT arm experienced fatal cardiac events.
The relationship, if any, between receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibition and cardiac function remains unclear.
Patients who presented with cardiac events within 12 months prior to SUTENT administration, such as myocardial infarction (including severe/ unstable angina), coronary/ peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism were excluded from SUTENT clinical studies.
Close monitoring for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF should be performed, especially in patients with cardiac risk factors and/ or history of coronary artery disease.
Physicians are advised to weigh this risk against the potential benefits of the drug.
These patients should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF while receiving SUTENT.
Baseline and periodic evaluations of LVEF should also be considered while the patient is receiving SUTENT.
In patients without cardiac risk factors, a baseline evaluation of ejection fraction should be considered.
In the presence of clinical manifestations of CHF, discontinuation of SUTENT is recommended.
The dose of SUTENT should be interrupted and/ or reduced in patients without clinical evidence of CHF but with an ejection fraction< 50% and > 20% below baseline.
QT Interval prolongation Data from non-clinical (in vitro and in vivo) studies, at doses higher than the recommended human dose, indicate that sunitinib has the potential to inhibit the cardiac action potential repolarization process (e. g. prolongation of QT interval).
Increases in the QTc interval to over 500 msec occurred in 0.5% and changes from baseline in excess of 60 msec occurred in 1.1% of the 450 solid tumours patients; both these parameters are recognized as potentially significant changes.
At approximately twice therapeutic concentrations, SUTENT has been shown to prolong the QTcF Inteval (Frederica’ s Correction).
QT interval prolongation was investigated in a trial in 24 patients, aged 20-87 years, with advanced malignancies.
The results of this study demonstrated that sunitinib had an effect on QTc (defined as a mean placebo-adjusted change of > 10 msec with a 90% CI upper limit > 15 msec) at therapeutic concentration (day 3) using the within-day baseline correction method, and at greater than therapeutic concentration (Day 9) using both baseline correction methods.
No patients had a QTc value > 500 msec.
Although an effect on QTcF was observed on Day 3 at 24 hours post-dose (i. e. at therapeutic plasma concentration expected after the recommended starting dose of 50 mg) with the within-day baseline correction method, the clinical significance of this finding is unclear.
Using comprehensive serial ECG assessments at times corresponding to either therapeutic or greater than therapeutic exposures, none of the patients in the evaluable or ITT populations were observed to develop QTc prolongation considered as “ severe” (i. e. equal to or greater than Grade 3 by CTCAE version 3.0).
At therapeutic plasma concentrations, the maximum QTcF (Frederica’ s correction) mean change from baseline was 9.6 msec (90% CI 15.1msec).
At approximately twice therapeutic concentrations, the maximum QTcF change from baseline was 15.4 msec (90% CI 22.4 msec).
Moxifloxacin (400 mg) used as a positive control showed a 5.6 msec maximum mean QTcF change from baseline.
No subjects experienced an effect on the QTc inteval greater than Grade 2 (CTCAE version 3.0).
No patient presented with a cardiac arrhythmia.
QT interval prolongation may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de pointes.
Torsade de pointes has been observed in < 0.1% of SUTENT-exposed patients.
SUTENT should be used with caution in patients with a known history of QT interval prolongation, patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances.
Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, which may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations, should be used with caution and the dose of SUTENT reduced (see Section 4.2 and 4.5).
Venous Thromboembolic Events Treatment-related venous thromboembolic events were reported in approximately 1.0% of patients with solid tumours who received SUTENT on clinical trials, including GIST and MRCC.
5 Seven patients (3%) on SUTENT and none on placebo in a phase 3 GIST study experienced venous thromboembolic events; five of the seven were Grade 3 deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and two were Grade 1 or 2.
Four of these seven GIST patients discontinued treatment following first observation of DVT.
Seven patients (1.9%) receiving SUTENT in the phase 3 treatment-naïve MRCC study and four patients (2%) on the two cytokine-refractory MRCC studies had treatment-related venous thromboembolic events reported.
Six of these patients had pulmonary embolisms, one was Grade 3 and five were Grade 4, and five of these patients had DVT, one each with Grade 1 and 2, and three with Grade 3.
In treatment-naïve MRCC patients receiving IFN-α, six (2%) venous thromboembolic events occurred; one patient (< 1%) experienced a Grade 3 DVT and five patients (1%) had pulmonary embolisms, one with Grade 1 and four with Grade 4.
No cases with fatal outcome were reported in GIST and MRCC registrational studies.
Cases with fatal out- come had been observed in post-marketing setting (see respiratory events and section 4.8).
Respiratory events Patients who presented with pulmonary embolism within the previous 12 months were excluded from SUTENT clinical studies.
In patients who received SUTENT in Phase 3 registrational studies, treatment-related pulmonary events (i. e. dyspnoea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism or pulmonary oedema) were reported in approximately 5% of patients with GIST and in approximately 14% of patients with MRCC.
Rare cases with fatal outcome were reported.
Approximately 8% of patients with solid tumours, including GIST and MRCC, who received SUTENT in clinical trials experienced treatment-related pulmonary events.
Cases of Pulmonary embolism were observed in approximately 1.3% of patients with GIST and in approximately 0.8% of patients with MRCC, who received Sutent in Phase 3 studies (see section 4.4 - Venous Thromboembolic Events).
Thyroid Dysfunction Baseline laboratory measurement of thyroid function is recommended, and patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should be treated as per standard medical practice prior to the start of sunitinib treatment.
All patients should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction on sunitinib treatment.
Patients with signs and/ or symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction should have laboratory monitoring of thyroid function performed and be treated as per standard medical practice.
Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 7 patients (4%) across the two cytokine-refractory MRCC studies; in nine patients (2%) on SUTENT and one patient (< 1%) in the IFN-α arm in the treatment- naïve MRCC study.
Additionally, TSH elevations were reported in 4 cytokine-refractory MRCC patients (2%).
Overall, 7% of the MRCC population had either clinical or laboratory evidence of treatment-emergent hypothyroidism.
Treatment-emergent acquired hypothyroidism was noted in 8 GIST patients (4%) on SUTENT versus 1 (1%) on placebo.
Rare cases of hyperthyroidism, some followed by hypothyroidism, have been reported in clinical trials and through post-marketing experience.
Pancreatitis Increases in serum lipase and amylase activities were observed in patients with various solid tumours who received SUTENT.
Increases in lipase activities were transient and were generally not accompanied by signs or symptoms of pancreatitis in subjects with various solid tumours.
Pancreatitis has been observed rarely (< 1%) in patients receiving SUTENT for GIST or MRCC.
Cases of serious pancreatic events, some with fatal outcome, have been reported.
If symptoms of pancreatitis are present, patients should have SUTENT discontinued and be provided with appropriate supportive care.
Hepatic Function Serious cases of SUTENT-related hepatobiliary events have been reported in patients with solid tumours; hepatic failure was observed in < 1% of these patients.
Cases of hepatobiliary events, some with fatal outcome, have been reported.
If signs or symptoms of hepatic failure are present, SUTENT should be discontinued and appropriate supportive care should be provided.
6 Renal function The safety of continued SUTENT treatment in patients with moderate to severe proteinuria has not been systematically evaluated.
Cases of proteinuria and rare cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported.
Baseline urinalysis is recommended, and patients should be monitored for the development or worsening of proteinuria.
Discontinue SUTENT in patients with nephrotic syndrome.
Seizures In clinical studies of SUTENT and from post-marketing experience, seizures have been observed in subjects with or without radiological evidence of brain metastases.
In addition, there have been rare (< 1%) reports of subjects presenting with seizures and radiological evidence of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS).
Patients with seizures and signs/ symptoms consistent with RPLS, such as hypertension, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning and visual loss, including cortical blindness should be controlled with medical management including control of hypertension.
Temporary suspension of SUTENT is recommended; following resolution, treatment may be resumed at the discretion of the treating physician.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Drugs that may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations:
Concomitant administration of sunitinib malate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 49% and 51% increase of the complex [sunitinib + primary metabolite] Cmax and AUC0-∞ values, respectively, after a single dose of sunitinib malate in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with potent inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e. g. ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase sunitinib concentrations Combination with inhibitors should therefore be avoided, or the selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be reduced to a minimum of 37.5 mg daily, based on careful monitoring of the tolerability (see section 4.2).
Drugs that may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations:
Concomitant use of SUTENT with the CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in a 23% and 46% reduction of the complex [sunitinib + primary metabolite] Cmax and AUC0-∞ values, respectively, after a single dose of SUTENT in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with potent inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e. g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum known also as St.
John’ s Wort) may decrease sunitinib concentrations.
Combination with inducers should therefore be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be increased in 12.5 mg increments (up to 87,5 mg per day) based on careful monitoring of tolerability (see section 4.2).
To maintain sunitinib target concentrations, selection of co-medications with less enzyme induction potential, should be considered.
If this is not possible, dose-adjustments of SUTENT may be necessary (see section 4.2).
Haemorrhage has been observed rarely in patients treated with SUTENT (see section 4.4).
Patients receiving concomitant treatment with anti-coagulants (e. g. warfarin; acenocumarole) may be periodically monitored by complete blood counts (platelets), coagulation factors (PT/ INR), and physical examination.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no studies in pregnant women using SUTENT.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including foetal malformations (see section 5.3).
SUTENT should not be used during pregnancy or in any woman not employing adequate contraception unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
If the drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.
7 Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with SUTENT.
Based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with SUTENT (see section 5.3).
Lactation Sunitinib and/ or its metabolites are excreted in rat milk.
It is not known whether sunitinib or its primary active metabolite are excreted in human milk.
Because drugs are commonly excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women should not breast feed while taking SUTENT.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or operate machinery have been performed.
Patients should be advised that they may experience dizziness during treatment with SUTENT.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most important treatment-related serious adverse events associated with SUTENT treatment of patients with solid tumours were pulmonary embolism (1%), thrombocytopoenia (1%), tumour haemorrhage (0.9%), febrile neutropoenia (0.4%), and hypertension (0.4%).
The most common treatment-related adverse events (experienced by at least 20% of the patients) of any grade included: fatigue; gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhoea, nausea, stomatitis, dyspepsia and vomiting; skin discolouration; dysgeusia and anorexia.
Fatigue, hypertension and neutropoenia were the most common treatment-related adverse events of Grade 3 maximum severity and increased lipase was the most frequently occurring treatment-related adverse event of Grade 4 maximum severity in patients with solid tumours.
Hepatitis and hepatic failure occurred in < 1% of patients and prolonged QT interval in < 0.1% (see section 4.4).
Fatal events other than those listed in section 4.4 above or section 4.8 below that were considered possibly related to SUTENT included multi-system organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, peritonoeal haemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, cerebrovascular accident, dehydration, adrenal insufficiency, renal failure, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, shock, and sudden death.
Treatment-related adverse reactions that were reported in > 2% of solid tumour patients are listed below, by system organ class, frequency and grade of severity.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Frequencies are defined as:
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antineoplastic agents - Protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ATC Code:
LO1XE04
Sunitinib malate inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are implicated in tumour growth, pathologic angiogenesis, and metastatic progression of cancer.
Sunitinib was identified as inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET).
The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays.
CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical safety and efficacy of SUTENT has been studied in the treatment of patients with malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) who were resistant to imatinib (i. e. those who experienced disease progression during or following treatment with imatinib) or intolerant to imatinib (i. e. those who experienced significant toxicity during treatment with imatinib that precluded further treatment) and the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) Efficacy is based on time to tumour progression and an increase in survival in GIST and on progression free survival and objective response rates for treatment-naïve and cytokine-refractory MRCC respectively.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours An initial open-label, dose-escalation study was conducted in patients with GIST after failure of imatinib (Median maximum daily dose 800 mg) due to resistance or intolerance.
Ninety-seven patients were enrolled at various doses and schedules; 55 patients received 50 mg at the recommended treatment schedule 4 weeks on / 2 weeks off (“ schedule 4/ 2”).
In this study the median Time To Progression (TTP) was 34.0 weeks (95% CI = 22.0 – 46.0 weeks).
A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of SUTENT was conducted in patients with GIST who were intolerant to, or had experienced disease progression during or following treatment with, imatinib (Median maximum daily dose 800 mg).
In this study, 312 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either 50 mg SUTENT or placebo, orally once daily on Schedule 4/ 2 until disease progression or withdrawal from the study for another reason (207 patients received SUTENT and 105 patients received placebo).
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was TTP, defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumour progression.
14 The median TTP on SUTENT was 28.9 weeks (95% CI = 21.3-34.1 weeks) and was statistically significantly longer than the TTP of 5.1 weeks (95% CI = 4.4-10.1 weeks) on placebo.
The difference in overall survival was statistically in favour of SUTENT [hazard ratio:
0.491 (95%C. I.
0.290- 0.831)]; the risk of death was 2 times higher in patients in the placebo arm compared to the SUTENT arm.
The percentages of deaths were 14% for SUTENT vs 25% for placebo.
Median overall survival had not yet been reached in either treatment arm at the time of analysis.
Treatment-naïve Metastatic Renal cell Carcinoma (MRCC) A phase 3 randomized, multicenter, international, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sunitinib compared with IFN-α in patients with treatment-naïve metastatic RCC was conducted.
Seven hundred and fifty patients were randomized 1:1 to the treatment arms; they received treatment with either sunitinib in repeated 6-week cycles, consisting of 4 weeks of 50 mg daily oral administration followed by 2 weeks of rest (Schedule 4/ 2), or IFN-α, administered as a subcutaneous injection of 3 million units (MU) the first week, 6 MU the second week, and 9 MU the third week and thereafter on 3 non-consecutive days each week.
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).
In this study the median PFS for the sunitinib-treated group was 47.3 weeks compared with 22.0 weeks for the IFN-α -treated group; the hazard ratio was 0.415 (95% CI:
0.320-0.539, p-value < 0.001).
Cytokine-Refractory Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma A phase 2 study of SUTENT was conducted in patients who were refractory to prior cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 or interferon-α.
Sixty-three patients received a starting dose of 50 mg of SUTENT orally, once daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest period, to comprise a complete cycle of 6 weeks (schedule 4/ 2).
The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST).
In this study the objective response rate was 36.5% (95% C. I.
24.7% - 49.6%) and the median time to progression (TTP) was 37.7 weeks (95% C. I.
24.0 - 46.4 weeks).
A confirmatory, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of SUTENT was conducted in patients with MRCC who were refractory to prior cytokine therapy.
One hundred and six patients received at least one 50 mg dose of SUTENT on schedule 4/ 2.
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was Objective Response Rate (ORR).
Secondary endpoints included TTP, duration of response (DR) and overall survival (OS).
In this study the ORR was 35,8% (95% C. I.
26.8% – 47.5%) The median DR and OS had not yet been reached.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of sunitinib and sunitinib malate have been evaluated in 135 healthy volunteers and 266 patients with solid tumours.
Absorption After oral administration of sunitinib, maximum concentrations (Cmax) are generally observed from 6 to 12 hours (Tmax) post-dose.
Food has no effect on the bioavailability of sunitinib.
Distribution Binding of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite to human plasma protein in in vitro assays was 95% and 90%, respectively, with no apparent concentration dependence.
The apparent volume of distribution (V/ F) for sunitinib was large – 2230l -, indicating distribution into the tissues.
Metabolism The calculated in vitro Ki values for all CYP isoforms tested (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/ 5 AND CYP4A9/ 11) indicated that sunitinib and its
15 primary active metabolite are unlikely to inhibit metabolism, to any clinically relevant extent, of drugs that may be metabolized by these enzymes.
In-vitro studies also indicate that SUTENT neither induces nor inhibits major CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4.
Biotransformation Sunitinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, the cytochrome P450 enzyme, which produces its primary active metabolite, which is then further metabolized by CYP3A4.
Concurrent administration of SUTENT with the potent CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted approximately in 56% and 78% reduction in sunitinib Cmax and AUC0-∞, values respectively, after a single dose of SUTENT in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with other inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e. g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum, known also as St.
John’ s Wort) may decrease sunitinib concentrations.
Elimination Excretion is primarily via faeces (61%) with renal elimination of drug and metabolites accounting for 16% of the administered dose.
Sunitinib and its primary active metabolite were the major drug-related compounds identified in plasma, urine and faeces, representing 91.5%, 86.4% and 73.8% of radioactivity in pooled samples, respectively.
Minor metabolites were identified in urine and faeces, but generally were not found in plasma.
Total oral clearance (CL/ F) was 34-62 l/ hr.
Organ Functions impairment Hepatic insufficiency:
Sunitinib and its primary metabolite are mainly metabolized by the liver.
Systemic exposures after a single dose of SUTENT were similar in subjects with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh Class A and B) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.
SUTENT was not studied in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment.
Studies in cancer patients have excluded patients with ALT or AST > 2.5 x ULN (Upper Limit of Normal) or, if due to liver metastasis, > 5.0 x ULN.
Renal insufficiency:
No clinical studies have been performed in patients with impaired renal function Studies excluded patients with serum creatinine > 2.0 x ULN.
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that sunitinib apparent clearance (CL/ F) was not affected by creatinine clearance within the range evaluated (42-347 ml/ min).
Plasma Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the elimination half-lives of sunitinib and its primary active desethyl metabolite are approximately 40 - 60 hours, and 80 - 110 hours, respectively.
In the dosing ranges of 25 to 100 mg, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmax increase proportionally with dose.
With repeated daily administration, sunitinib accumulates 3- to 4-fold and its primary active metabolite accumulates 7- to 10-fold.
Steady-state concentrations of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are achieved within 10 to 14 days.
By day 14, combined plasma concentrations of sunitinib and is active metabolite are 62.9 - 101 ng/ ml which are target concentrations predicted from preclinical data to inhibit receptor phosphorylation in vitro and result in tumour stasis/ growth reduction in vivo.
The primary active metabolite comprises 23 to 37% of the total exposure.
No significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib or the primary, active metabolite are observed with repeated daily administration or with repeated cycles in the dosing regimens tested.
The pharmacokinetics were similar in all solid tumour populations tested and in healthy volunteers.
Population pharmacokinetic analyses of demographic data indicate that no dose adjustments are necessary for weight or ECOG score.
Available data indicate that females could have about 30% lower apparent clearance (CL/ F) of sunitinib than males: this difference however does not necessitate dose adjustments.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In rat and monkey repeated-dose toxicity studies up to 9-months duration, the primary target organ effects were identified in the gastrointestinal tract (emesis and diarrhoea in monkeys), adrenal gland (cortical congestion and/ or haemorrhage in rats and monkeys, with necrosis followed by fibrosis in rats),
16 haemolymphopoietic system (bone morrow hypocelularity, and lymphoid depletion of thymus, spleen, and lymph node), exocrine pancreas (acinar cell degranulation with single cell necrosis), salivary gland (acinar hypertrophy), bone joint (growth plate thickening), uterus (atrophy) and ovaries (decreased follicular development).
All findings occurred at clinically relevant sunitinib plasma exposure levels.
Additional effects, observed in other studies included QTc interval prolongation, LVEF reduction, pituitary hypertrophy, and testicular tubular atrophy, increased mesangial cells in kidney, haemorrhage in GI tract and oral mucosa, and hypertrophy of anterior pituitary cells.
Changes in the uterus (endometrial atrophy) and bone growth plate (physeal thickening or dysplasia of cartilage) are thought to be related to the pharmacological action of sunitinib.
Most of these findings were reversible after 2 to 6 weeks without treatment.
Genotoxicity The genotoxic potential of sunitinib was assessed in vitro and in vivo.
Sunitinib was not mutagenic in bacteria using metabolic activation provided by rat liver.
Sunitinib did not induce structural chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cells in vitro.
Polyploidy (numerical chromosome aberrations) was observed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.
Sunitinib was not clastogenic in rat bone marrow in vivo.
The major active metabolite was not evaluated for genetic toxicity potential.
Carcinogenicity Carcinogenicity studies with sunitinib malate have not been performed.
Reproductive and Developmental toxicity No effects on male or female fertility were observed in reproductive toxicity studies.
However, in repeated- dose toxicity studies performed in rats and monkeys, effects on female fertility were observed in the form of follicular atresia, degeneration of corpora lutea, endometrial changes in the uterus and decreased uterine and ovarian weights at clinically relevant systemic exposure levels.
Effects on male fertility in rat were observed in the form of tubular atrophy in the testes, reduction of spermatozoa in epididimes and colloid depletion in prostate and seminal vesicles at plasma exposure levels 18-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
In rats, embryo-foetal mortality was evident as significant reductions in the number of live foetuses, increased numbers of resorptions increased postimplantation loss, and total litter loss in 8 of 28 pregnant females at plasma exposure levels 5.5-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
In rabbits, reductions in gravid uterine weights and number of live foetuses were due to increases in the number of resorptions, increases in post-implantation loss and complete litter loss in 4 of 6 pregnant females at plasma exposure levels 3-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
Sunitinib treatment in rats during organogenesis resulted in developmental effects at ≥ 5 mg/ kg/ day consisting of increased incidence of foetal skeletal malformations, predominantly characterized as retarded ossification of thoracic/ lumbar vertebrae and occurred at plasma exposure levels 6-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
In rabbits, developmental effects consisted of increased incidence of cleft lip at plasma exposure levels approximately equal to that observed in clinic, and cleft lip and cleft palate at plasma exposure levels 2.7-fold higher than is observed in clinic.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST) SUTENT is indicated for the treatment of unresectable and/ or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) after failure of imatinib mesylate treatment due to resistance or intolerance.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (MRCC) SUTENT is indicated for the treatment of advanced and/ or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma or GIST.
The recommended dose of SUTENT is one 50 mg dose orally, taken daily for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period (schedule 4/ 2) to comprise a complete cycle of 6 weeks.
Dose adjustments Safety and Tolerability Dose modifications in 12.5-mg steps may be applied based on individual safety and tolerability.
Daily dose should not exceed 75 mg nor be decreased below 25 mg.
CYP3A4 Inhibitors/ Inducers Co-administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
If this is not possible, the dose of SUTENT may need to be increased in 12.5 mg increments (up to 87.5 mg per day) based on careful monitoring of tolerability.
Co-administration of SUTENT with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
If this is not possible the doses of SUTENT may need to be reduced to a minimum of 37.5 mg daily, based on careful monitoring of the tolerability.
Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to induce or inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered.

Approximately 34% of the subjects in clinical studies of SUTENT were 65 or over.
No significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between younger and older patients.
Hepatic Insufficiency:
No dose adjustment is recommended when administering SUTENT to patients with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh Class A and B) hepatic impairment.
SUTENT has not been studied in subjects with Child-Pugh Class C hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Renal Insufficiency:
No clinical studies have been performed in patients with impaired renal function.
(see section 5.2).
SUTENT may be taken with or without food.
If a dose is missed the patient should not be given an additional dose.
The patient should take the usual prescribed dose on the following day.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to sunitinib malate or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Co-administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations.
Combination with inducers should therefore be avoided.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be increased (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations.
Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential is recommended.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be reduced (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Skin and tissues Skin discolouration, possibly due to the active substance colour (yellow) is a common treatment-related adverse event occurring in approximately 30% of patients.
Patients should be advised that depigmentation of the hair or skin may also occur during treatment with SUTENT.
Other possible dermatologic effects may include dryness, thickness or cracking of the skin, blisters or occasional rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
Mouth pain/ irritation was reported in approximately 14% of patients.
Dysgeusia (taste disturbance) was reported in approximately 28% of patients.
The above events were not cumulative, were typically reversible and generally did not result in treatment discontinuation.
Haemorrhage Haemorrhagic events, some of which were fatal, reported through post-marketing experience, have included GI, respiratory, tumour, urinary tract and brain haemorrhages.
In clinical trials treatment-related tumour haemorrhage occurred in approximately 2% of patients with GIST.
These events may occur suddenly, and in the case of pulmonary tumours, may present as severe and life-threatening haemoptysis or pulmonary haemorrhage.
Fatal pulmonary haemorrhage occurred in 2 patients receiving SUTENT on a clinical trial of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Both patients had squamous cell histology.
SUTENT is not approved for use in patients with NSCLC.
Bleeding events occurred in 18% of patients receiving SUTENT in a phase 3 GIST Study compared to 17% of patients receiving placebo.
In patients receiving SUTENT for treatment-naïve MRCC, 28% had bleeding events compared to 7% of patients receiving IFN-α.
Seven (1.9%) patients on sunitinib malate versus 0% of patients on IFN-α experienced Grade 3 or greater treatment-related bleeding events.
Of patients receiving sunitinib malate for cytokine-
20 refractory MRCC, 26% experienced bleeding.
Routine assessment of this event should include complete blood counts and physical examination.
Epistaxis was the most common treatment-related haemorrhagic adverse event, having been reported for approximately half of the patients with solid tumours who experienced haemorrhagic events.
Some of these events were severe, but very rarely fatal.
Gastrointestinal events Nausea, diarrhoea, stomatitis, dyspepsia and vomiting were the most commonly reported treatment-related gastrointestinal events.
Supportive care for gastrointestinal adverse events requiring treatment may include medication with an anti- emetic or anti-diarrhoeal medication.
Gastro-intestinal tract Serious, sometimes fatal gastrointestinal complications including gastrointestinal perforation have occurred rarely in patients with intra-abdominal malignancies treated with SUTENT.
Treatment-related fatal gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving placebo in the GIST Phase 3 study.
Hypertension Treatment-related hypertension was reported in approximately 16% of patients with solid tumours.
SUTENT dosing was reduced or temporarily delayed in approximately 2.7% of this patient population.
None of these patients were discontinued from treatment with SUTENT.
Severe hypertension (> 200 mmHg systolic or 110 mmHg diastolic) occurred in 4.7% of this patient population.
Treatment-related hypertension was reported in approximately 24% of patients receiving sunitinib malate for treatment-naïve MRCC compared to 1% of patients receiving IFN-α.
Severe hypertension occurred in 5% of treatment-naïve patients on sunitinib malate and 1% of patients on IFN-α.
Patients should be screened for hypertension and controlled as appropriate.
Temporary suspension is recommended in patients with severe hypertension that is not controlled with medical management.
Treatment may be resumed once hypertension is appropriately controlled.
Haematological Decreased absolute neutrophil counts of grade 3 and 4 severity were reported in 10% and 1.7% of patients on the phase 3 GIST study, respectively and in 16% and 1.6% of patients on the phase 3 MRCC study, respectively.
Decreased platelet counts of grade 3 and 4 severity were reported in 3.7% and 0.4% of patients on the phase 3 GIST study, respectively, and in 8.2% and 1.1% of patients on the phase 3 MRCC study, respectively.
The above events were not cumulative, were typically reversible and generally did not result in treatment discontinuation.
None of these events in the phase 3 studies were fatal, but rare fatal haematological events have been reported through post-marketing experience.
Complete blood counts should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT.
Cardiovascular Cardiovascular events, some of which were fatal, reported through post-marketing experience, have included left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease and cardiac failure.
In clinical trials, decreases in LVEF of ≥ 20% and below the lower limit of normal occurred in approximately 2% of SUTENT-treated GIST patients, 4% of cytokine-refractory MRCC patients, 2% of placebo-treated patients.
These LVEF declines do not appear to have been progressive and often improved as treatment continued.
In the treatment-naïve MRCC study, 21% patients on SUTENT and 12% of patients on interferon-α (IFN-α), had an LVEF value below the lower limit of normal.
One (< 1%) patient who received SUTENT was diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF).
Treatment-related adverse events of ‘ cardiac failure’, ‘ cardiac failure congestive’ or ‘ left ventricular failure’ were reported in 0.7% of patients with solid tumours and 1% of patients treated with placebo.
All patients had GIST.
In the phase 3 GIST study (n=312), treatment-related fatal cardiac events occurred in 1% of patients on each arm of the study (i. e.
SUTENT and placebo arms).
In a phase 2 study in cytokine-refractory MRCC patients, 0.9% of patients experienced treatment-related fatal myocardial infarction and in the phase 3 study in treatment-naïve MRCC patients, 0.6% of patients on the IFN-α arm and 0 patients on the
21 SUTENT arm experienced fatal cardiac events.
The relationship, if any, between receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibition and cardiac function remains unclear.
Patients who presented with cardiac events within 12 months prior to SUTENT administration, such as myocardial infarction (including severe/ unstable angina), coronary/ peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism were excluded from SUTENT clinical studies.
Close monitoring for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF should be performed, especially in patients with cardiac risk factors and/ or history of coronary artery disease.
Physicians are advised to weigh this risk against the potential benefits of the drug.
These patients should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF while receiving SUTENT.
Baseline and periodic evaluations of LVEF should also be considered while the patient is receiving SUTENT.
In patients without cardiac risk factors, a baseline evaluation of ejection fraction should be considered.
In the presence of clinical manifestations of CHF, discontinuation of SUTENT is recommended.
The dose of SUTENT should be interrupted and/ or reduced in patients without clinical evidence of CHF but with an ejection fraction< 50% and > 20% below baseline.
QT Interval prolongationData from non-clinical (in vitro and in vivo) studies, at doses higher than the recommended human dose, indicate that sunitinib has the potential to inhibit the cardiac action potential repolarization process (e. g. prolongation of QT interval).
Increases in the QTc interval to over 500 msec occurred in 0.5% and changes from baseline in excess of 60 msec occurred in 1.1% of the 450 solid tumours patients; both these parameters are recognized as potentially significant changes.
At approximately twice therapeutic concentrations, SUTENT has been shown to prolong the QTcF Inteval (Frederica’ s Correction).
QT interval prolongation was investigated in a trial in 24 patients, aged 20-87 years, with advanced malignancies.
The results of this study demonstrated that sunitinib had an effect on QTc (defined as a mean placebo-adjusted change of > 10 msec with a 90% CI upper limit > 15 msec) at therapeutic concentration (day 3) using the within-day baseline correction method, and at greater than therapeutic concentration (Day 9) using both baseline correction methods.
No patients had a QTc value > 500 msec.
Although an effect on QTcF was observed on Day 3 at 24 hours post-dose (i. e. at therapeutic plasma concentration expected after the recommended starting dose of 50 mg) with the within-day baseline correction method, the clinical significance of this finding is unclear.
Using comprehensive serial ECG assessments at times corresponding to either therapeutic or greater than therapeutic exposures, none of the patients in the evaluable or ITT populations were observed to develop QTc prolongation considered as “ severe” (i. e. equal to or greater than Grade 3 by CTCAE version 3.0).
At therapeutic plasma concentrations, the maximum QTcF (Frederica’ s correction) mean change from baseline was 9.6 msec (90% CI 15.1msec).
At approximately twice therapeutic concentrations, the maximum QTcF change from baseline was 15.4 msec (90% CI 22.4 msec).
Moxifloxacin (400 mg) used as a positive control showed a 5.6 msec maximum mean QTcF change from baseline.
No subjects experienced an effect on the QTc inteval greater than Grade 2 (CTCAE version 3.0).
No patient presented with a cardiac arrhythmia.
QT interval prolongation may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de pointes.
Torsade de pointes has been observed in < 0.1% of SUTENT-exposed patients.
SUTENT should be used with caution in patients with a known history of QT interval prolongation, patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances.
Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, which may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations, should be used with caution and the dose of SUTENT reduced (see Section 4.2 and 4.5).
Venous Thromboembolic Events Treatment-related venous thromboembolic events were reported in approximately 1.0% of patients with solid tumours who received SUTENT on clinical trials, including GIST and MRCC.
22 Seven patients (3%) on SUTENT and none on placebo in a phase 3 GIST study experienced venous thromboembolic events; five of the seven were Grade 3 deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and two were Grade 1 or 2.
Four of these seven GIST patients discontinued treatment following first observation of DVT.
Seven patients (1.9%) receiving SUTENT in the phase 3 treatment-naïve MRCC study and four patients (2%) on the two cytokine-refractory MRCC studies had treatment-related venous thromboembolic events reported.
Six of these patients had pulmonary embolisms, one was Grade 3 and five were Grade 4, and five of these patients had DVT, one each with Grade 1 and 2, and three with Grade 3.
In treatment-naïve MRCC patients receiving IFN-α, six (2%) venous thromboembolic events occurred; one patient (< 1%) experienced a Grade 3 DVT and five patients (1%) had pulmonary embolisms, one with Grade 1 and four with Grade 4.
No cases with fatal outcome were reported in GIST and MRCC registrational studies.
Cases with fatal out- come had been observed in post-marketing setting (see respiratory events and section 4.8).
Respiratory Events Patients who presented with pulmonary embolism within the previous 12 months were excluded from SUTENT clinical studies.
In patients who received SUTENT in Phase 3 registrational studies, treatment- related pulmonary events (i. e. dyspnoea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism or pulmonary oedema) were reported in approximately 5% of patients with GIST and in approximately 14% of patients with MRCC.
Rare cases with fatal outcome were reported Approximately 8% of patients with solid tumours, including GIST and MRCC, who received Sutent in clinical trials experienced treatment-related pulmonary events.
Cases of Pulmonary embolism were observed in approximately 1.3% of patients with GIST and in approximately 0.8% of patients with MRCC, who received Sutent in Phase 3 studies (see section 4.4 - Venous Thromboembolic Events).
Thyroid Dysfunction Baseline laboratory measurement of thyroid function is recommended, and patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should be treated as per standard medical practice prior to the start of sunitinib treatment.
All patients should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction on sunitinib treatment.
Patients with signs and/ or symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction should have laboratory monitoring of thyroid function performed and be treated as per standard medical practice.
Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 7 patients (4%) across the two cytokine-refractory MRCC studies; in nine patients (2%) on SUTENT and one patient (< 1%) in the IFN-α arm in the treatment- naïve MRCC study.
Additionally, TSH elevations were reported in 4 cytokine-refractory MRCC patients (2%).
Overall, 7% of the MRCC population had either clinical or laboratory evidence of treatment-emergent hypothyroidism.
Treatment-emergent acquired hypothyroidism was noted in 8 GIST patients (4%) on SUTENT versus 1 (1%) on placebo.
Rare cases of hyperthyroidism, some followed by hypothyroidism, have been reported in clinical trials and through post-marketing experience.
Pancreatitis Increases in serum lipase and amylase activities were observed in patients with various solid tumours who received SUTENT.
Increases in lipase activities were transient and were generally not accompanied by signs or symptoms of pancreatitis in subjects with various solid tumours.
Pancreatitis has been observed rarely (< 1%) in patients receiving SUTENT for GIST or MRCC.
Cases of serious pancreatic events, some with fatal outcome, have been reported.
If symptoms of pancreatitis are present, patients should have SUTENT discontinued and be provided with appropriate supportive care.
Hepatic Function Serious cases of SUTENT-related hepatobiliary events have been reported in patients with solid tumours; hepatic failure was observed in < 1% of these patients.
Cases of hepatobiliary events, some with fatal outcome, have been reported.
If signs or symptoms of hepatic failure are present, SUTENT should be discontinued and appropriate supportive care should be provided.
23 Renal function The safety of continued SUTENT treatment in patients with moderate to severe proteinuria has not been systematically evaluated.
Cases of proteinuria and rare cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported.
Baseline urinalysis is recommended, and patients should be monitored for the development or worsening of proteinuria.
Discontinue SUTENT in patients with nephrotic syndrome.
Seizures In clinical studies of SUTENT and from post-marketing experience, seizures have been observed in subjects with or without radiological evidence of brain metastases.
In addition, there have been rare (< 1%) reports of subjects presenting with seizures and radiological evidence of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS).
Patients with seizures and signs/ symptoms consistent with RPLS, such as hypertension, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning and visual loss, including cortical blindness should be controlled with medical management including control of hypertension.
Temporary suspension of SUTENT is recommended; following resolution, treatment may be resumed at the discretion of the treating physician.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Drugs that may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations:.
Concomitant administration of sunitinib malate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 49% and 51% increase of the complex [sunitinib + primary metabolite] Cmax and AUC0-∞ values, respectively, after a single dose of sunitinib malate in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with potent inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e. g. ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase sunitinib concentrations Combination with inhibitors should therefore be avoided, or the selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be reduced to a minimum of 37.5 mg daily, based on careful monitoring of the tolerability (see section 4.2).
Drugs that may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations:
Concomitant use of SUTENT with the CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in a 23% and 46% reduction of the complex [sunitinib + primary metabolite] Cmax and AUC0-∞ values, respectively, after a single dose of SUTENT in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with potent inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e. g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum known also as St.
John’ s Wort) may decrease sunitinib concentrations.
Combination with inducers should therefore be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be increased in 12.5 mg increments (up to 87,5 mg per day) based on careful monitoring of tolerability (see section 4.2).
To maintain sunitinib target concentrations, selection of co-medications with less enzyme induction potential, should be considered.
If this is not possible, dose-adjustments of SUTENT may be necessary (see section 4.2).
Haemorrhage has been observed rarely in patients treated with SUTENT (see section 4.4).
Patients receiving concomitant treatment with anti-coagulants (e. g. warfarin; acenocumarole) may be periodically monitored by complete blood counts (platelets), coagulation factors (PT/ INR), and physical examination.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no studies in pregnant women using SUTENT.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including foetal malformations (see section 5.3).
SUTENT should not be used during pregnancy or in any woman not employing adequate contraception unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
If the drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.
24 Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with SUTENT.
Based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with SUTENT (see section 5.3).
Lactation Sunitinib and/ or its metabolites are excreted in rat milk.
It is not known whether sunitinib or its primary active metabolite are excreted in human milk.
Because drugs are commonly excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women should not breast feed while taking SUTENT.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or operate machinery have been performed.
Patients should be advised that they may experience dizziness during treatment with SUTENT.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most important treatment-related serious adverse events associated with SUTENT treatment of patients with solid tumours were pulmonary embolism (1%), thrombocytopoenia (1%), tumour haemorrhage (0.9%), febrile neutropoenia (0.4%), and hypertension (0.4%).
The most common treatment-related adverse events (experienced by at least 20% of the patients) of any grade included: fatigue; gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhoea, nausea, stomatitis, dyspepsia and vomiting; skin discolouration; dysgeusia and anorexia.
Fatigue, hypertension and neutropoenia were the most common treatment-related adverse events of Grade 3 maximum severity and increased lipase was the most frequently occurring treatment-related adverse event of Grade 4 maximum severity in patients with solid tumours.
Hepatitis and hepatic failure occurred in < 1% of patients and prolonged QT interval in < 0.1% (see section 4.4).
Fatal events other than those listed in section 4.4 above or section 4.8 below that were considered possibly related to SUTENT drug included multi-system organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, peritoneal haemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, cerebrovascular accident, dehydration, adrenal insufficiency, renal failure, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, shock, and sudden death.
Treatment-related adverse reactions that were reported in > 2% of solid tumour patients are listed below, by system organ class, frequency and grade of severity.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Frequencies are defined as:
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antineoplastic agents - Protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ATC Code:
LO1XE04
Sunitinib malate inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are implicated in tumour growth, pathologic angiogenesis, and metastatic progression of cancer.
Sunitinib was identified as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET).
The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays.
CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical safety and efficacy of SUTENT has been studied in the treatment of patients with malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) who were resistant to imatinib (i. e. those who experienced disease
31 progression during or following treatment with imatinib) or intolerant to imatinib (i. e. those who experienced significant toxicity during treatment with imatinib that precluded further treatment) and the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) Efficacy is based on time to tumour progression and an increase in survival in GIST and on progression free survival and objective response rates for treatment-naïve and cytokine-refractory MRCC respectively.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours An initial open-label, dose-escalation study was conducted in patients with GIST after failure of imatinib (Median maximum daily dose 800 mg) due to resistance or intolerance.
Ninety-seven patients were enrolled at various doses and schedules; 55 patients received 50 mg at the recommended treatment schedule 4 weeks on / 2 weeks off (“ schedule 4/ 2”).
In this study the median Time To Progression (TTP) was 34.0 weeks (95% CI = 22.0 – 46.0 weeks).
A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of SUTENT was conducted in patients with GIST who were intolerant to, or had experienced disease progression during or following treatment with, imatinib (Median maximum daily dose 800 mg).
In this study, 312 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either 50 mg SUTENT or placebo, orally once daily on Schedule 4/ 2 until disease progression or withdrawal from the study for another reason (207 patients received SUTENT and 105 patients received placebo).
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was TTP, defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumour progression.
The median TTP on SUTENT was 28.9 weeks (95% CI = 21.3-34.1 weeks) and was statistically significantly longer than the TTP of 5.1 weeks (95% CI = 4.4-10.1 weeks) on placebo.
The difference in overall survival was statistically in favour of SUTENT [hazard ratio:
0.491 (95%C. I.
0.290- 0.831)]; the risk of death was 2 times higher in patients in the placebo arm compared to the SUTENT arm.
The percentages of deaths were 14% for SUTENT vs 25% for placebo.
Median overall survival had not yet been reached in either treatment arm at the time of analysis.
Treatment-naïve Metastatic Renal cell Carcinoma (MRCC) A phase 3 randomized, multicenter, international, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sunitinib compared with IFN-α in patients with treatment-naïve metastatic RCC was conducted.
Seven hundred and fifty patients were randomized 1:1 to the treatment arms; they received treatment with either sunitinib in repeated 6-week cycles, consisting of 4 weeks of 50 mg daily oral administration followed by 2 weeks of rest (Schedule 4/ 2), or IFN-α, administered as a subcutaneous injection of 3 million units (MU) the first week, 6 MU the second week, and 9 MU the third week and thereafter on 3 non-consecutive days each week.
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).
In this study the median PFS for the sunitinib-treated group was 47.3 weeks compared with 22.0 weeks for the IFN-α -treated group; the hazard ratio was 0.415 (95% CI:
0.320-0.539, p-value < 0.001).
Cytokine-Refractory Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma A phase 2 study of SUTENT was conducted in patients who were refractory to prior cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 or interferon-α.
Sixty-three patients received a starting dose of 50 mg of SUTENT orally, once daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest period, to comprise a complete cycle of 6 weeks (schedule 4/ 2).
The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST).
In this study the objective response rate was 36.5% (95% C. I.
24.7% - 49.6%) and the median time to progression (TTP) was 37.7 weeks (95% C. I.
24.0 - 46.4 weeks).
A confirmatory, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of SUTENT was conducted in patients with MRCC who were refractory to prior cytokine therapy.
One hundred and six patients received at least one 50 mg dose of SUTENT on schedule 4/ 2.
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was Objective Response Rate (ORR).
Secondary endpoints included TTP, duration of response (DR) and overall survival (OS).
32 In this study the ORR was 35,8% (95% C. I.
26.8% – 47.5%) The median DR and OS had not yet been reached.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of sunitinib and sunitinib malate have been evaluated in 135 healthy volunteers and 266 patients with solid tumours.
Absorption After oral administration of sunitinib, maximum concentrations (Cmax) are generally observed from 6 to 12 hours (Tmax) post-dose.
Food has no effect on the bioavailability of sunitinib.
Distribution Binding of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite to human plasma protein in in vitro assays was 95% and 90%, respectively, with no apparent concentration dependence.
The apparent volume of distribution (V/ F) for sunitinib was large – 2230l -, indicating distribution into the tissues.
Metabolism The calculated in vitro Ki values for all CYP isoforms tested (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/ 5 AND CYP4A9/ 11) indicated that sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are unlikely to inhibit metabolism, to any clinically relevant extent, of drugs that may be metabolized by these enzymes.
In-vitro studies also indicate that SUTENT neither induces nor inhibits major CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4.
Biotransformation Sunitinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, the cytochrome P450 enzyme, which produces its primary active metabolite, which is then further metabolized by CYP3A4.
Concurrent administration of SUTENT with the potent CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted approximately in 56% and 78% reduction in sunitinib Cmax and AUC0-∞, values respectively, after a single dose of SUTENT in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with other inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e. g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum, known also as St.
John’ s Wort) may decrease sunitinib concentrations.
Elimination Excretion is primarily via faeces (61%) with renal elimination of drug and metabolites accounting for 16% of the administered dose.
Sunitinib and its primary active metabolite were the major drug-related compounds identified in plasma, urine and faeces, representing 91.5%, 86.4% and 73.8% of radioactivity in pooled samples, respectively.
Minor metabolites were identified in urine and faeces, but generally were not found in plasma.
Total oral clearance (CL/ F) was 34-62 l/ hr.
Organ Functions impairment Hepatic insufficiency:
Sunitinib and its primary metabolite are mainly metabolized by the liver.
Systemic exposures after a single dose of SUTENT were similar in subjects with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh Class A and B) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.
SUTENT was not studied in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment.
Studies in cancer patients have excluded patients with ALT or AST > 2.5 x ULN (Upper Limit of Normal) or, if due to liver metastasis, > 5.0 x ULN.
Renal insufficiency:
No clinical studies have been performed in patients with impaired renal function Studies excluded patients with serum creatinine > 2.0 x ULN.
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that sunitinib apparent clearance (CL/ F) was not affected by creatinine clearance within the range evaluated (42-347 ml/ min).
33 Plasma Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the elimination half-lives of sunitinib and its primary active desethyl metabolite are approximately 40 - 60 hours, and 80 - 110 hours, respectively.
In the dosing ranges of 25 to 100 mg, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmax increase proportionally with dose.
With repeated daily administration, sunitinib accumulates 3- to 4-fold and its primary active metabolite accumulates 7- to 10-fold.
Steady-state concentrations of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are achieved within 10 to 14 days.
By day 14, combined plasma concentrations of sunitinib and is active metabolite are 62.9 - 101 ng/ ml which are target concentrations predicted from preclinical data to inhibit receptor phosphorylation in vitro and result in tumour stasis/ growth reduction in vivo.
The primary active metabolite comprises 23 to 37% of the total exposure.
No significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib or the primary, active metabolite are observed with repeated daily administration or with repeated cycles in the dosing regimens tested.
The pharmacokinetics were similar in all solid tumour populations tested and in healthy volunteers.
Population pharmacokinetic analyses of demographic data indicate that no dose adjustments are necessary for weight or ECOG score.
Available data indicate that females could have about 30% lower apparent clearance (CL/ F) of sunitinib than males: this difference however does not necessitate dose adjustments.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In rat and monkey repeated-dose toxicity studies up to 9-months duration, the primary target organ effects were identified in the gastrointestinal tract (emesis and diarrhoea in monkeys), adrenal gland (cortical congestion and/ or haemorrhage in rats and monkeys, with necrosis followed by fibrosis in rats), haemolymphopoietic system (bone morrow hypocelularity, and lymphoid depletion of thymus, spleen, and lymph node), exocrine pancreas (acinar cell degranulation with single cell necrosis), salivary gland (acinar hypertrophy), bone joint (growth plate thickening), uterus (atrophy) and ovaries (decreased follicular development).
All findings occurred at clinically relevant sunitinib plasma exposure levels.
Additional effects, observed in other studies included QTc interval prolongation, LVEF reduction, pituitary hypertrophy, and testicular tubular atrophy, increased mesangial cells in kidney, haemorrhage in GI tract and oral mucosa, and hypertrophy of anterior pituitary cells.
Changes in the uterus (endometrial atrophy) and bone growth plate (physeal thickening or dysplasia of cartilage) are thought to be related to the pharmacological action of sunitinib.
Most of these findings were reversible after 2 to 6 weeks without treatment.
Genotoxicity The genotoxic potential of sunitinib was assessed in vitro and in vivo.
Sunitinib was not mutagenic in bacteria using metabolic activation provided by rat liver.
Sunitinib did not induce structural chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cells in vitro.
Polyploidy (numerical chromosome aberrations) was observed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.
Sunitinib was not clastogenic in rat bone marrow in vivo.
The major active metabolite was not evaluated for genetic toxicity potential.
Carcinogenicity Carcinogenicity studies with sunitinib malate have not been performed.
Reproductive and Developmental toxicity No effects on male or female fertility were observed in reproductive toxicity studies.
However, in repeated- dose toxicity studies performed in rats and monkeys, effects on female fertility were observed in the form of follicular atresia, degeneration of corpora lutea, endometrial changes in the uterus and decreased uterine and ovarian weights at clinically relevant systemic exposure levels.
Effects on male fertility in rat were observed in the form of tubular atrophy in the testes, reduction of spermatozoa in epididimes and colloid depletion in prostate and seminal vesicles at plasma exposure levels 18-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
In rats, embryo-foetal mortality was evident as significant reductions in the number of live foetuses, increased numbers of resorptions increased postimplantation loss, and total litter loss in 8 of 28 pregnant
34 females at plasma exposure levels 5.5-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
In rabbits, reductions in gravid uterine weights and number of live foetuses were due to increases in the number of resorptions, increases in post-implantation loss and complete litter loss in 4 of 6 pregnant females at plasma exposure levels 3-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
Sunitinib treatment in rats during organogenesis resulted in developmental effects at ≥ 5 mg/ kg/ day consisting of increased incidence of foetal skeletal malformations, predominantly characterized as retarded ossification of thoracic/ lumbar vertebrae and occurred at plasma exposure levels 6-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
In rabbits, developmental effects consisted of increased incidence of cleft lip at plasma exposure levels approximately equal to that observed in clinic, and cleft lip and cleft palate at plasma exposure levels 2.7-fold higher than is observed in clinic.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST) SUTENT is indicated for the treatment of unresectable and/ or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) after failure of imatinib mesylate treatment due to resistance or intolerance.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (MRCC) SUTENT is indicated for the treatment of advanced and/ or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma or GIST.
The recommended dose of SUTENT is one 50 mg dose orally, taken daily for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period (schedule 4/ 2) to comprise a complete cycle of 6 weeks.
Dose adjustments Safety and Tolerability Dose modifications in 12.5-mg steps may be applied based on individual safety and tolerability.
Daily dose should not exceed 75 mg nor be decreased below 25 mg.
CYP3A4 Inhibitors/ Inducers Co-administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
If this is not possible, the dose of SUTENT may need to be increased in 12.5 mg increments (up to 87.5 mg per day) based on careful monitoring of tolerability.
Co-administration of SUTENT with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, should be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).
If this is not possible the doses of SUTENT may need to be reduced to a minimum of 37.5 mg daily, based on careful monitoring of the tolerability.
Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to induce or inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered.
Paediatric use:
The safety and efficacy of SUTENT in paediatric patients have not been established.
37 SUTENT should not be used in paediatric population until further data become available.
Elderly patients use:
Approximately 34% of the subjects in clinical studies of SUTENT were 65 or over.
No significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between younger and older patients.
Hepatic Insufficiency:
No dose adjustment is recommended when administering SUTENT to patients with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh Class A and B) hepatic impairment.
SUTENT has not been studied in subjects with Child-Pugh Class C hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Renal Insufficiency:
No clinical studies have been performed in patients with impaired renal function.
(see section 5.2).
SUTENT may be taken with or without food.
If a dose is missed the patient should not be given an additional dose.
The patient should take the usual prescribed dose on the following day.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to sunitinib malate or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Co-administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations.
Combination with inducers should therefore be avoided.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be increased (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations.
Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential is recommended.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be reduced (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Skin and tissues Skin discolouration, possibly due to the active substance colour (yellow) is a common treatment-related adverse event occurring in approximately 30% of patients.
Patients should be advised that depigmentation of the hair or skin may also occur during treatment with SUTENT.
Other possible dermatologic effects may include dryness, thickness or cracking of the skin, blisters or occasional rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
Mouth pain/ irritation was reported in approximately 14% of patients.
Dysgeusia (taste disturbance) was reported in approximately 28% of patients.
The above events were not cumulative, were typically reversible and generally did not result in treatment discontinuation.
Haemorrhage Haemorrhagic events, some of which were fatal, reported through post-marketing experience, have included GI, respiratory, tumour, urinary tract and brain haemorrhages.
In clinical trials treatment-related tumour haemorrhage occurred in approximately 2% of patients with GIST.
These events may occur suddenly, and in the case of pulmonary tumours, may present as severe and life-threatening haemoptysis or pulmonary haemorrhage.
Fatal pulmonary haemorrhage occurred in 2 patients receiving SUTENT on a clinical trial of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Both patients had squamous cell histology.
SUTENT is not approved for use in patients with NSCLC.
Bleeding events occurred in 18% of patients receiving SUTENT in a phase 3 GIST Study compared to 17% of patients receiving placebo.
In patients receiving SUTENT for treatment-naïve MRCC, 28% had bleeding events compared to 7% of patients receiving IFN-α.
Seven (1.9%) patients on sunitinib malate versus 0% of patients on IFN-α experienced Grade 3 or greater treatment-related bleeding events.
Of patients receiving sunitinib malate for cytokine-
38 refractory MRCC, 26% experienced bleeding.
Routine assessment of this event should include complete blood counts and physical examination.
Epistaxis was the most common treatment-related haemorrhagic adverse event, having been reported for approximately half of the patients with solid tumours who experienced haemorrhagic events.
Some of these events were severe, but very rarely fatal.
Gastrointestinal events Nausea, diarrhoea, stomatitis, dyspepsia and vomiting were the most commonly reported treatment-related gastrointestinal events.
Supportive care for gastrointestinal adverse events requiring treatment may include medication with an anti- emetic or anti-diarrhoeal medication.
Gastro-intestinal tract Serious, sometimes fatal gastrointestinal complications including gastrointestinal perforation have occurred rarely in patients with intra-abdominal malignancies treated with SUTENT.
Treatment-related fatal gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving placebo in the GIST Phase 3 study.
Hypertension Treatment-related hypertension was reported in approximately 16% of patients with solid tumours.
SUTENT dosing was reduced or temporarily delayed in approximately 2.7% of this patient population.
None of these patients were discontinued from treatment with SUTENT.
Severe hypertension (> 200 mmHg systolic or 110 mmHg diastolic) occurred in 4.7% of this patient population.
Treatment-related hypertension was reported in approximately 24% of patients receiving sunitinib malate for treatment-naïve MRCC compared to 1% of patients receiving IFN-α.
Severe hypertension occurred in 5% of treatment-naïve patients on sunitinib malate and 1% of patients on IFN-α.
Patients should be screened for hypertension and controlled as appropriate.
Temporary suspension is recommended in patients with severe hypertension that is not controlled with medical management.
Treatment may be resumed once hypertension is appropriately controlled.
Haematological Decreased absolute neutrophil counts of grade 3 and 4 severity were reported in 10% and 1.7% of patients on the phase 3 GIST study, respectively, and in 16% and 1.6% of patients on the phase 3 MRCC study, respectively.
Decreased platelet counts of grade 3 and 4 severity were reported in 3.7% and 0.4% of patients on the phase 3 GIST study, respectively, and in 8.2% and 1.1% of patients on the phase 3 MRCC study, respectively.
The above events were not cumulative, were typically reversible and generally did not result in treatment discontinuation.
None of these events in the phase 3 studies were fatal, but rare fatal haematological events have been reported through post-marketing experience.
Complete blood counts should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT.
Cardiovascular Cardiovascular events, some of which were fatal, reported through post-marketing experience, have included left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease and cardiac failure.
In clinical trials, decreases in LVEF of ≥ 20% and below the lower limit of normal occurred in approximately 2% of SUTENT-treated GIST patients, 4% of cytokine-refractory MRCC patients, 2% of placebo-treated patients.
These LVEF declines do not appear to have been progressive and often improved as treatment continued.
In the treatment-naïve MRCC study, 21% patients on SUTENT and 12% of patients on interferon-α (IFN-α), had an LVEF value below the lower limit of normal.
One (< 1%) patient who received SUTENT was diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF).
Treatment-related adverse events of ‘ cardiac failure’, ‘ cardiac failure congestive’ or ‘ left ventricular failure’ were reported in 0.7% of patients with solid tumours and 1% of patients treated with placebo.
All patients had GIST.
In the phase 3 GIST study (n=312), treatment-related fatal cardiac events occurred in 1% of patients on each arm of the study (i. e.
SUTENT and placebo arms).
In a phase 2 study in cytokine-refractory MRCC patients, 0.9% of patients experienced treatment-related fatal myocardial infarction and in the phase 3 study in treatment-naïve MRCC patients, 0.6% of patients on the IFN-α arm and 0 patients on the
39 SUTENT arm experienced fatal cardiac events.
The relationship, if any, between receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibition and cardiac function remains unclear.
Patients who presented with cardiac events within 12 months prior to SUTENT administration, such as myocardial infarction (including severe/ unstable angina), coronary/ peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism were excluded from SUTENT clinical studies.
Close monitoring for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF should be performed, especially in patients with cardiac risk factors and/ or history of coronary artery disease.
Physicians are advised to weigh this risk against the potential benefits of the drug.
These patients should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of CHF while receiving SUTENT.
Baseline and periodic evaluations of LVEF should also be considered while the patient is receiving SUTENT.
In patients without cardiac risk factors, a baseline evaluation of ejection fraction should be considered.
In the presence of clinical manifestations of CHF, discontinuation of SUTENT is recommended.
The dose of SUTENT should be interrupted and/ or reduced in patients without clinical evidence of CHF but with an ejection fraction< 50% and > 20% below baseline.
QT Interval prolongation Data from non-clinical (in vitro and in vivo) studies, at doses higher than the recommended human dose, indicate that sunitinib has the potential toinhibit the cardiac action potential repolarization process (e. g. prolongation of QT interval).
Increases in the QTc interval to over 500 msec occurred in 0.5% and changes from baseline in excess of 60 msec occurred in 1.1% of the 450 solid tumours patients; both these parameters are recognized as potentially significant changes.
At approximately twice therapeutic concentrations, SUTENT has been shown to prolong the QTcF Inteval (Frederica’ s Correction).
QT interval prolongation was investigated in a trial in 24 patients, aged 20-87 years, with advanced malignancies.
The results of this study demonstrated that sunitinib had an effect on QTc (defined as a mean placebo-adjusted change of > 10 msec with a 90% CI upper limit > 15 msec) at therapeutic concentration (day 3) using the within-day baseline correction method, and at greater than therapeutic concentration (Day 9) using both baseline correction methods.
No patients had a QTc value > 500 msec.
Although an effect on QTcF was observed on Day 3 at 24 hours post-dose (i. e. at therapeutic plasma concentration expected after the recommended starting dose of 50 mg) with the within-day baseline correction method, the clinical significance of this finding is unclear.
Using comprehensive serial ECG assessments at times corresponding to either therapeutic or greater than therapeutic exposures, none, of the patients in the evaluable or ITT populations were observed to develop QTc prolongation considered as “ severe” (i. e. equal to or greater than Grade 3 by CTCAE version 3.0).
At therapeutic plasma concentrations, the maximum QTcF (Frederica’ s correction) mean change from baseline was 9.6 msec (90% CI 15.1msec).
At approximately twice therapeutic concentrations, the maximum QTcF change from baseline was 15.4 msec (90% CI 22.4 msec).
Moxifloxacin (400 mg) used as a positive control showed a 5.6 msec maximum mean QTcF change from baseline.
No subjects experienced an effect on the QTc inteval greater than Grade 2 (CTCAE version 3.0).
No patient presented with a cardiac arrhythmia.
QT interval prolongation may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de pointes.
Torsade de pointes has been observed in < 0.1% of SUTENT-exposed patients.
SUTENT should be used with caution in patients with a known history of QT interval prolongation, patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances.
Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, which may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations, should be used with caution and the dose of SUTENT reduced (see Section 4.2 and 4.5).
Venous Thromboembolic Events Treatment-related venous thromboembolic events were reported in approximately 1.0% of patients with solid tumours who received SUTENT on clinical trials, including GIST and MRCC.
40 Seven patients (3%) on SUTENT and none on placebo in a phase 3 GIST study experienced venous thromboembolic events; five of the seven were Grade 3 deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and two were Grade 1 or 2.
Four of these seven GIST patients discontinued treatment following first observation of DVT.
Seven patients (1.9%) receiving SUTENT in the phase 3 treatment-naïve MRCC study and four patients (2%) on the two cytokine-refractory MRCC studies had treatment-related venous thromboembolic events reported.
Six of these patients had pulmonary embolisms, one was Grade 3 and five were Grade 4, and five of these patients had DVT, one each with Grade 1 and 2, and three with Grade 3.
In treatment-naïve MRCC patients receiving IFN-α, six (2%) venous thromboembolic events occurred; one patient (< 1%) experienced a Grade 3 DVT and five patients (1%) had pulmonary embolisms, one with Grade 1 and four with Grade 4.
No cases with fatal outcome were reported in GIST and MRCC registrational studies.
Cases with fatal out- come had been observed in post-marketing setting (see respiratory events and section 4.8).
Pulmonary Events Patients who presented with pulmonary embolism within the previous 12 months were excluded from SUTENT clinical studies.
In patients who received Sutent in Phase 3 registrational studies, treatment-related pulmonary events (i. e. dyspnoea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism or pulmonary oedema) were reported in approximately 5% of patients with GIST and in approximately 14% of patients with MRCC.
Rare cases with fatal outcome were reported Approximately 8% of patients with solid tumours, including GIST and MRCC, who received Sutent in clinical trials experienced treatment-related pulmonary events.
Cases of Pulmonary embolism were observed in approximately 1.3% of patients with GIST and in approximately 0.8% of patients with MRCC, who received Sutent in Phase 3 studies (see section 4.4 - Venous Thromboembolic Events).
Thyroid Dysfunction Baseline laboratory measurement of thyroid function is recommended, and patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should be treated as per standard medical practice prior to the start of sunitinib treatment.
All patients should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction on sunitinib treatment.
Patients with signs and/ or symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction should have laboratory monitoring of thyroid function performed and be treated as per standard medical practice.
Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 7 patients (4%) across the two cytokine-refractory MRCC studies; in nine patients (2%) on SUTENT and one patient (< 1%) in the IFN-α arm in the treatment- naïve MRCC study.
Additionally, TSH elevations were reported in 4 cytokine-refractory MRCC patients (2%).
Overall, 7% of the MRCC population had either clinical or laboratory evidence of treatment-emergent hypothyroidism.
Treatment-emergent acquired hypothyroidism was noted in 8 GIST patients (4%) on SUTENT versus 1 (1%) on placebo.
Rare cases of hyperthyroidism, some followed by hypothyroidism, have been reported in clinical trials and through post-marketing experience.
Pancreatitis Increases in serum lipase and amylase activities were observed in patients with various solid tumours who received SUTENT.
Increases in lipase activities were transient and were generally not accompanied by signs or symptoms of pancreatitis in subjects with various solid tumours.
Pancreatitis has been observed rarely (< 1%) in patients receiving SUTENT for GIST or MRCC.
Cases of serious pancreatic events, some with fatal outcome, have been reported.
If symptoms of pancreatitis or hepatic failure are present, patients should have SUTENT discontinued and be provided with appropriate supportive care.
Hepatic Function Serious cases of SUTENT-related hepatobiliary events have been reported in patients with solid tumours; hepatic failure was observed in < 1% of these patients.
Cases of hepatobiliary events, some with fatal outcome, have been reported.
If signs or symptoms of hepatic failure are present, SUTENT should be discontinued and appropriate supportive care should be provided.
41 Renal function The safety of continued SUTENT treatment in patients with moderate to severe proteinuria has not been systematically evaluated.
Cases of proteinuria and rare cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported.
Baseline urinalysis is recommended, and patients should be monitored for the development or worsening of proteinuria.
Discontinue SUTENT in patients with nephrotic syndrome.
Seizures In clinical studies of SUTENT and from post-marketing experience, seizures have been observed in subjects with or without radiological evidence of brain metastases.
In addition, there have been rare (< 1%) reports of subjects presenting with seizures and radiological evidence of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS).
Patients with seizures and signs/ symptoms consistent with RPLS, such as hypertension, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning and visual loss, including cortical blindness should be controlled with medical management including control of hypertension.
Temporary suspension of SUTENT is recommended; following resolution, treatment may be resumed at the discretion of the treating physician.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Drugs that may increase sunitinib plasma concentrations:.
Concomitant administration of sunitinib malate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 49% and 51% increase of the complex [sunitinib + primary metabolite] Cmax and AUC0-∞ values, respectively, after a single dose of sunitinib malate in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with potent inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e. g. ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase sunitinib concentrations Combination with inhibitors should therefore be avoided, or the selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should be considered.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be reduced to a minimum of 37.5 mg daily, based on careful monitoring of the tolerability (see section 4.2).
Drugs that may decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations:
Concomitant use of SUTENT with the CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in a 23% and 46% reduction of the complex [sunitinib + primary metabolite] Cmax and AUC0-∞ values, respectively, after a single dose of SUTENT in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with potent inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e. g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum known also as St.
John’ s Wort) may decrease sunitinib concentrations.
Combination with inducers should therefore be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no, or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered.
If this is not possible, the dosage of SUTENT may need to be increased in 12.5 mg increments (up to 87,5 mg per day) based on careful monitoring of tolerability (see section 4.2).
To maintain sunitinib target concentrations, selection of co-medications with less enzyme induction potential, should be considered.
If this is not possible, dose-adjustments of SUTENT may be necessary (see section 4.2).
Haemorrhage has been observed rarely in patients treated with SUTENT (see section 4.4).
Patients receiving concomitant treatment with anti-coagulants (e. g. warfarin; acenocumarole) may be periodically monitored by complete blood counts (platelets), coagulation factors (PT/ INR), and physical examination.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy There are no studies in pregnant women using SUTENT.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including foetal malformations (see section 5.3).
SUTENT should not be used during pregnancy or in any woman not employing adequate contraception unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
If the drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the foetus.
42 Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with SUTENT.
Based on non-clinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with SUTENT (see section 5.3).
Lactation Sunitinib and/ or its metabolites are excreted in rat milk.
It is not known whether sunitinib or its primary active metabolite are excreted in human milk.
Because drugs are commonly excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women should not breast feed while taking SUTENT.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or operate machinery have been performed.
Patients should be advised that they may experience dizziness during treatment with SUTENT.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most important treatment-related serious adverse events associated with SUTENT treatment of patients with solid tumours were pulmonary embolism (1%), thrombocytopoenia (1%), tumour haemorrhage (0.9%), febrile neutropoenia (0.4%), and hypertension (0.4%).
The most common treatment-related adverse events (experienced by at least 20% of the patients) of any grade included: fatigue; gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhoea, nausea, stomatitis, dyspepsia and vomiting; skin discolouration; dysgeusia and anorexia.
Fatigue, hypertension and neutropoenia were the most common treatment-related adverse events of Grade 3 maximum severity and increased lipase was the most frequently occurring treatment-related adverse event of Grade 4 maximum severity in patients with solid tumours.
Hepatitis and hepatic failure occurred in < 1% of patients and prolonged QT interval in < 0.1% (see section 4.4).
Fatal events other than those listed in section 4.4 above or section 4.8 below which were considered possibly related to SUTENT included multi-system organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, peritoneal haemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, cerebrovascular accident, dehydration, adrenal insufficiency, renal failure, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, shock, and sudden death.
Treatment-related adverse reactions that were reported in > 2% of solid tumour patients are listed below, by system organ class, frequency and grade of severity.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Frequencies are defined as:
Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Antineoplastic agents - Protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ATC Code:
LO1XE04
Sunitinib malate inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are implicated in tumour growth, pathologic angiogenesis, and metastatic progression of cancer.
Sunitinib was identified as inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R), and the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET).
The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays.
49 CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical safety and efficacy of SUTENT has been studied in the treatment of patients with malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) who were resistant to imatinib (i. e. those who experienced disease progression during or following treatment with imatinib) or intolerant to imatinib (i. e. those who experienced significant toxicity during treatment with imatinib that precluded further treatment) and the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) Efficacy is based on time to tumour progression and an increase in survival in GIST and on progression free survival and objective response rates for treatment-naïve and cytokine-refractory MRCC respectively.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours An initial open-label, dose-escalation study was conducted in patients with GIST after failure of imatinib (Median maximum daily dose 800 mg) due to resistance or intolerance.
Ninety-seven patients were enrolled at various doses and schedules; 55 patients received 50 mg at the recommended treatment schedule 4 weeks on / 2 weeks off (“ schedule 4/ 2”).
In this study the median Time To Progression (TTP) was 34.0 weeks (95% CI = 22.0 – 46.0 weeks).
A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of SUTENT was conducted in patients with GIST who were intolerant to, or had experienced disease progression during or following treatment with, imatinib (Median maximum daily dose 800 mg).
In this study, 312 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either 50 mg SUTENT or placebo, orally once daily on Schedule 4/ 2 until disease progression or withdrawal from the study for another reason (207 patients received SUTENT and 105 patients received placebo).
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was TTP, defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumour progression.
The median TTP on SUTENT was 28.9 weeks (95% CI = 21.3-34.1 weeks) and was statistically significantly longer than the TTP of 5.1 weeks (95% CI = 4.4-10.1 weeks) on placebo.
The difference in overall survival was statistically in favour of SUTENT [hazard ratio:
0.491 (95%C. I.
0.290- 0.831)]; the risk of death was 2 times higher in patients in the placebo arm compared to the SUTENT arm.
The percentages of deaths were 14% for SUTENT vs 25% for placebo.
Median overall survival had not yet been reached in either treatment arm at the time of analysis.
Treatment-naïve Metastatic Renal cell Carcinoma (MRCC) A phase 3 randomized, multicenter, international, study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sunitinib compared with IFN-α in patients with treatment-naïve metastatic RCC was conducted.
Seven hundred and fifty patients were randomized 1:1 to the treatment arms; they received treatment with either sunitinib in repeated 6-week cycles, consisting of 4 weeks of 50 mg daily oral administration followed by 2 weeks of rest (Schedule 4/ 2), or IFN-α, administered as a subcutaneous injection of 3 million units (MU) the first week, 6 MU the second week, and 9 MU the third week and thereafter on 3 non-consecutive days each week.
The primary efficacy endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).
In this study the median PFS for the sunitinib-treated group was 47.3 weeks compared with 22.0 weeks for the IFN-α -treated group; the hazard ratio was 0.415 (95% CI:
0.320-0.539, p-value < 0.001).
Cytokine-Refractory Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma A phase 2 study of SUTENT was conducted in patients who were refractory to prior cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 or interferon-α.
Sixty-three patients received a starting dose of 50 mg of SUTENT orally, once daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest period, to comprise a complete cycle of 6 weeks (schedule 4/ 2).
The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST).
In this study the objective response rate was 36.5% (95% C. I.
24.7% - 49.6%) and the median time to progression (TTP) was 37.7 weeks (95% C. I.
24.0 - 46.4 weeks).
A confirmatory, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of SUTENT was conducted in patients with MRCC who were refractory to prior cytokine therapy.
One hundred and six patients received at least one 50 mg dose of SUTENT on schedule 4/ 2.
50 The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was Objective Response Rate (ORR).
Secondary endpoints included TTP, duration of response (DR) and overall survival (OS).
In this study the ORR was 35,8% (95% C. I.
26.8% – 47.5%) The median DR and OS had not yet been reached.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of sunitinib and sunitinib malate have been evaluated in 135 healthy volunteers and 266 patients with solid tumours.
Absorption After oral administration of sunitinib, maximum concentrations (Cmax) are generally observed from 6 to 12 hours (Tmax) post-dose.
Food has no effect on the bioavailability of sunitinib.
Distribution Binding of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite to human plasma protein in in vitro assays was 95% and 90%, respectively, with no apparent concentration dependence.
The apparent volume of distribution (V/ F) for sunitinib was large – 2230l -, indicating distribution into the tissues.
Metabolism The calculated in vitro Ki values for all CYP isoforms tested (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/ 5 AND CYP4A9/ 11) indicated that sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are unlikely to inhibit metabolism, to any clinically relevant extent, of drugs that may be metabolized by these enzymes.
In-vitro studies also indicate that SUTENT neither induces nor inhibits major CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4.
Biotransformation Sunitinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, the cytochrome P450 enzyme, which produces its primary active metabolite, which is then further metabolized by CYP3A4.
Concurrent administration of SUTENT with the potent CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted approximately in 56% and 78% reduction in sunitinib Cmax and AUC0-∞, values respectively, after a single dose of SUTENT in healthy volunteers.
Administration of SUTENT with other inducers of the CYP3A4 family (e. g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or Hypericum perforatum, known also as St.
John’ s Wort) may decrease sunitinib concentrations.
Elimination Excretion is primarily via faeces (61%) with renal elimination of drug and metabolites accounting for 16% of the administered dose.
Sunitinib and its primary active metabolite were the major drug-related compounds identified in plasma, urine and faeces, representing 91.5%, 86.4% and 73.8% of radioactivity in pooled samples, respectively.
Minor metabolites were identified in urine and faeces, but generally were not found in plasma.
Total oral clearance (CL/ F) was 34-62 l/ hr.
Organ Functions impairment Hepatic insufficiency:
Sunitinib and its primary metabolite are mainly metabolized by the liver.
Systemic exposures after a single dose of SUTENT were similar in subjects with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh Class A and B) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.
SUTENT was not studied in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment.
Studies in cancer patients have excluded patients with ALT or AST > 2.5 x ULN (Upper Limit of Normal) or, if due to liver metastasis, > 5.0 x ULN.
Renal insufficiency:
No clinical studies have been performed in patients with impaired renal function Studies excluded patients with serum creatinine > 2.0 x ULN.
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that sunitinib apparent clearance (CL/ F) was not affected by creatinine clearance within the range evaluated (42-347 ml/ min).
51 Plasma Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, the elimination half-lives of sunitinib and its primary active desethyl metabolite are approximately 40 - 60 hours, and 80 - 110 hours, respectively.
In the dosing ranges of 25 to 100 mg, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmax increase proportionally with dose.
With repeated daily administration, sunitinib accumulates 3- to 4-fold and its primary active metabolite accumulates 7- to 10-fold.
Steady-state concentrations of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are achieved within 10 to 14 days.
By day 14, combined plasma concentrations of sunitinib and is active metabolite are 62.9 - 101 ng/ ml which are target concentrations predicted from preclinical data to inhibit receptor phosphorylation in vitro and result in tumour stasis/ growth reduction in vivo.
The primary active metabolite comprises 23 to 37% of the total exposure.
No significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib or the primary, active metabolite are observed with repeated daily administration or with repeated cycles in the dosing regimens tested.
The pharmacokinetics were similar in all solid tumour populations tested and in healthy volunteers.
Population pharmacokinetic analyses of demographic data indicate that no dose adjustments are necessary for weight or ECOG score.
Available data indicate that females could have about 30% lower apparent clearance (CL/ F) of sunitinib than males: this difference however does not necessitate dose adjustments.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In rat and monkey repeated-dose toxicity studies up to 9-months duration, the primary target organ effects were identified in the gastrointestinal tract (emesis and diarrhoea in monkeys), adrenal gland (cortical congestion and/ or haemorrhage in rats and monkeys, with necrosis followed by fibrosis in rats), haemolymphopoietic system (bone morrow hypocelularity, and lymphoid depletion of thymus, spleen, and lymph node), exocrine pancreas (acinar cell degranulation with single cell necrosis), salivary gland (acinar hypertrophy), bone joint (growth plate thickening), uterus (atrophy) and ovaries (decreased follicular development).
All findings occurred at clinically relevant sunitinib plasma exposure levels.
Additional effects, observed in other studies included QTc interval prolongation, LVEF reduction, pituitary hypertrophy, and testicular tubular atrophy, increased mesangial cells in kidney, haemorrhage in GI tract and oral mucosa, and hypertrophy of anterior pituitary cells.
Changes in the uterus (endometrial atrophy) and bone growth plate (physeal thickening or dysplasia of cartilage) are thought to be related to the pharmacological action of sunitinib.
Most of these findings were reversible after 2 to 6 weeks without treatment.
Genotoxicity The genotoxic potential of sunitinib was assessed in vitro and in vivo.
Sunitinib was not mutagenic in bacteria using metabolic activation provided by rat liver.
Sunitinib did not induce structural chromosome aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cells in vitro.
Polyploidy (numerical chromosome aberrations) was observed in human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.
Sunitinib was not clastogenic in rat bone marrow in vivo.
The major active metabolite was not evaluated for genetic toxicity potential.
Carcinogenicity Carcinogenicity studies with sunitinib malate have not been performed.
Reproductive and Developmental toxicity No effects on male or female fertility were observed in reproductive toxicity studies.
However, in repeated- dose toxicity studies performed in rats and monkeys, effects on female fertility were observed in the form of follicular atresia, degeneration of corpora lutea, endometrial changes in the uterus and decreased uterine and ovarian weights at clinically relevant systemic exposure levels.
Effects on male fertility in rat were observed in the form of tubular atrophy in the testes, reduction of spermatozoa in epididimes and colloid depletion in prostate and seminal vesicles at plasma exposure levels 18-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
In rats, embryo-foetal mortality was evident as significant reductions in the number of live foetuses, increased numbers of resorptions increased postimplantation loss, and total litter loss in 8 of 28 pregnant
52 females at plasma exposure levels 5.5-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
In rabbits, reductions in gravid uterine weights and number of live foetuses were due to increases in the number of resorptions, increases in post-implantation loss and complete litter loss in 4 of 6 pregnant females at plasma exposure levels 3-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
Sunitinib treatment in rats during organogenesis resulted in developmental effects at ≥ 5 mg/ kg/ day consisting of increased incidence of foetal skeletal malformations, predominantly characterized as retarded ossification of thoracic/ lumbar vertebrae and occurred at plasma exposure levels 6-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
In rabbits, developmental effects consisted of increased incidence of cleft lip at plasma exposure levels approximately equal to that observed in clinic, and cleft lip and cleft palate at plasma exposure levels 2.7-fold higher than is observed in clinic.
