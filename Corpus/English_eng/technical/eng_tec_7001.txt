Color Deficient Vision
Deficient vision
The images you create, we hope, will be seen by many people on many different systems. The image which looks so wonderful on your screen may look somewhat different to people with sight deficiencies or on a screen with different settings from yours. Some information might not even be visible.
Description of the
Options
Color Deficiency Type
In this drop-down menu you can select from among:
Greek:
Protanopia
Protanopia is a visual deficiency of the color red. It's the well-known daltonism (red-green color blindness).
Protanopia is actually more complex than this; a person with this problem cannot see either red or green, although he is still sensitive to yellow and blue. In addition, he has a loss of luminance perception and the hues shift toward the short wavelengths.
Deuteranopia (insensivity to green)
With deuteranopia, the person has a deficiency in green vision. Deuteranopia is actually like protanopia, because the person has a loss of red and green perception, but he has no luminance loss or hue shift.
Tritanopia (insensitivity to blue)
With tritanopia, the person is deficient in blue and yellow perception, although he is still sensitive to red and green. He lacks some perception of luminance, and the hues shift toward the long wavelengths.
Examples
Example of protanopia with some text
Original image
As you can see, a red-blind person cannot see the red (255,0,0) text on a black (0,0,0) background. You have to change the text color. Daltonism occurs fairly frequently in the population.
Examples of the three types of vision deficiencies in one image
normal vision;
Protanopia;
deuteranopia; In deuteranopia, yellow is shifted toward red.
tritanopia; In tritanopia, green is slightly represented in the blue range.
