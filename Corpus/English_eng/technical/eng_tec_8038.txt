EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
EXJADE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Exjade?
Exjade is a medicine that contains the active substance deferasirox.
It is available as round, white dispersible tablets that are mixed with a liquid to make up a suspension that the patient can drink.
Each tablet contains 125 mg, 250 mg or 500 mg of deferasirox.
What is Exjade used for?
Exjade is used to treat a condition called chronic iron overload (an excess of iron in the body), which results from having repeated blood transfusions. • Exjade is used to reduce the amount of iron in the body of patients from six years of age who suffer from an inherited disease called beta thalassaemia major and who receive frequent blood transfusions to treat it.
Patients suffering from beta thalassaemia major are unable to make enough haemoglobin (the protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body), and they need regular blood transfusions.
Frequent transfusions are defined as at least 7 ml of packed (concentrated) red blood cells per kilogram body weight in a month. • Exjade is also used when deferoxamine (another medicine used to treat iron overload) cannot be used or is inadequate, in patients who suffer from other types of anaemia, in children aged from two to five years, and in patients with beta thalassaemia major who receive less frequent transfusions.
Because the number of patients with chronic iron overload is low, the disease is considered ‘ rare’, and Exjade was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 13 March 2002.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Exjade used?
Treatment with Exjade should be started and supervised by a doctor who is experienced in the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent transfusions.
Only patients who have no problems with their kidneys can be treated with Exjade.
The treatment starts once the patient has received about 100 ml of packed red blood cells per kilogram body weight, or once there are signs of iron overload (when the levels in the blood of ferritin, the protein in the body that stores iron, are over 1 mg per litre).
The treatment usually starts using a dose of 20 mg per kilogram body weight.
Starting doses of 10 or 30 mg/ kg can also be used, depending on the frequency of the patient ’ s transfusions.
These doses are then adjusted as needed, every three to six months, according to the response.

Exjade is taken every day, preferably at the same time each day, on an empty stomach (at least 30 minutes before food).
The number of tablets of each strength that make up a dose is calculated based on the patient’ s weight.
The tablets are dispersed by stirring them in a glass of water or fruit juice to make a suspension for the patient to drink.
How does Exjade work?
When patients receive repeated transfusions to correct anaemia, the transfused red cells bring iron into the body.
As the body does not have a natural way of removing excess iron, it can build up and, over time, damage important organs such as the heart or liver.
The active substance in Exjade, deferasirox, is an ‘ iron chelator’.
It binds to iron in the body to form a compound called a ‘ chelate ’ that can be excreted by the body, mainly in the stools.
This helps to correct the iron overload and prevent damage due to excess iron.
How has Exjade been studied?
The effects of Exjade were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The main study of effectiveness compared Exjade with deferoxamine in 591 patients with beta thalassaemia major.
About half of the patients were under the age of 16, and 56 were less than six years old.
The doctor and patients knew which medicine they were using because Exjade is given by mouth but deferoxamine is given by subcutaneous infusion (very slow injection under the skin) overnight.
The effectiveness was measured by looking at the level of iron contained in the liver before and after one year of treatment with the medicines.
An additional study looked at the effectiveness of Exjade in 184 patients who could not be treated with deferoxamine, including patients with beta thalassaemia major and with other types of anaemia.
What benefit has Exjade shown during the studies?
At the end of the main study, 53% of the patients receiving Exjade had shown a sufficient response to treatment, compared with 66% of the patients receiving deferoxamine.
This indicates that Exjade may not have been as effective as the comparator medicine.
However, when looking at the 381 patients who had particularly high levels of iron in their liver at the beginning of the study and who received comparable amounts of Exjade or deferoxamine, the two medicines were as effective as each other.
There were too few patients in this study aged below six years to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Exjade in this age group.
In the additional study, more than half of the patients who could not be treated with deferoxamine had responded to treatment with Exjade after a year, including patients aged between two and five years.
What is the risk associated with Exjade?
The most common side effect with Exjade (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) is increased blood creatinine (a marker of kidney problems).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Exjade, see the Package Leaflet.
Exjade should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to deferasirox or any of the other ingredients, or in people whose creatinine clearance (a measure of the ability of the kidney to remove creatinine from the blood) is below 60 ml per minute.
It should not be used in combination with other iron chelators.
It is very important that the patient ’ s kidneys and liver are checked with blood tests before treatment with Exjade is started, and regularly during treatment.
The dose should be reduced or treatment interrupted if a patient develops kidney or liver problems.
Exjade is not recommended for patients with severe liver problems as it has not been tested in this group.
Why has Exjade been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Exjade’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions in patients with beta thalassaemia major, and due to blood transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate.
The Committee recommended that the medicine be given marketing authorisation.
2/ 3 Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Exjade?
The company responsible for making Exjade available must prepare an education pack for doctors, which is distributed whenever the medicine is launched.
This pack will ensure that doctors know about the need to monitor the patient ’ s health, especially kidney function, when they prescribe the medicine.
The company will also prepare a similar pack for patients.
