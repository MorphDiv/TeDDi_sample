Introduction
What is & kappname;?
Put simply, & kappname; is a personal finance manager for & kde;. It enables users of open source operating systems to keep careful track of their personal finances by providing a broad array of financial features and tools.
The principal goals of the project are:
Feature Parity
& kappname; intends to provide all important features found in the commercially-available personal finance managers. Although this release is closer than ever to that goal, there is still work to be done.
Ease of Use.
& kappname; strives to be the easiest open source personal finance manager to use, especially for the non-technical user.
Correctness.
Based on tried and tested double entry accounting principles & kappname; ensures that your finances are kept in correct order.
What & kappname; is not
As a personal finance manager, & kappname; is not intended to scale to the needs of an average business. However, it would be possible to create client / supplier / document features through plugins.
& kappname; is not simply a clone of the commercially-available personal finance programs. Although many of the features present in & kappname; can be found in other similar applications, & kappname; strives to present an individual and unique view of your finances.
