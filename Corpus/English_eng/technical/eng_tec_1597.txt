Rnd function
Rnd Function [Run-time]
Returns a random number between 0 and 1.
Syntax:
Rnd [(Expression)]
Return value:
Double
Parameters:
Expression:
A numerical expression that defines how to generate random numbers.
Less than zero:
Always returns the same random number.
Greater than zero:
Returns the next random number in the sequence.
Zero:
Returns the random number that was last generated.
Omitted:
Returns the next random number in the sequence.
If the same number is passed for each successive call to the Rnd function, the same random-number sequence is generated.
This is because the Expression parameter is used as a starting point for the next number.
Rnd
function only returns values ranging from 0 to 1.
To generate random integers in a given range, use the formula in the following example:
Example:
Sub ExampleRandomSelect
Dim iVar As Integer
iVar = Int((15 * Rnd) -2)
Select Case iVar
Case 1 To 5
Print &quot; Number from 1 to 5 &quot;
Case 6, 7, 8
Print &quot; Number from 6 to 8 &quot;
Case Is > 8 And iVar < 11
Print &quot; Greater than 8 &quot;
Case Else
Print &quot; Outside range 1 to 10 &quot;
End Select
end sub
