There are backup set(s) at time(s):

Commands:
Specified archive directory '%s' does not exist, or is not a directory
Sign key should be an 8 character hex string, like 'AA0E73D2'.

Bad interval string "%s"

Intervals are specified like 2Y (2 years) or 2h30m (2.5 hours). The
allowed special characters are s, m, h, D, W, M, and Y. See the man
page for more information.
Bad time string "%s"

The acceptible time strings are intervals (like "3D64s"), w3-datetime
strings, like "2002-04-26T04:22:01-07:00" (strings like
"2002-04-26T04:22:01" are also acceptable - duplicity will use the
current time zone), or ordinary dates like 2/4/1997 or 2001-04-23
(various combinations are acceptable, but the month always precedes
the day).

Aborting because you may have accidentally tried to backup two different data sets to the same remote location, or using the same archive directory. If this is not a mistake, use the --allow-source-mismatch switch to avoid seeing this message
