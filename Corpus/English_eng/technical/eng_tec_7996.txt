EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
FOSAVANCE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Fosavance?
Fosavance is a medicine containing two active substances: alendronate sodium trihydrate and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
It is available as white tablets (capsule-shaped:
70 mg alendronate sodium trihydrate and 2,800 international units [IU] colecalciferol; rectangular:
70 mg alendronate sodium trihydrate and 5,600 IU colecalciferol).
What is Fosavance used for?
Fosavance (containing either 2,800 or 5,600 IU colecalciferol) is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile) in post-menopausal women at risk of low vitamin D levels.
Fosavance 70 mg/ 5,600 IU is for use in patients who are not taking vitamin D supplements.
Fosavance reduces the risk of vertebral (spine) and hip fractures (breaks).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Fosavance used?
The recommended dose is one tablet once a week.
Fosavance is intended for long-term use.
The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (not mineral water), at least 30 minutes before any food, drink, or other medicines (including antacids, calcium supplements and vitamins).
To avoid irritation of the oesophagus (gullet), the patient should not lie down until after their first food of the day, which should be at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.
The tablet should not be chewed or allowed to dissolve in the mouth.
Patients should also take calcium supplements if they are not getting enough calcium from their diet.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
How does Fosavance work?
Bone is a living tissue that is constantly renewed by a process that erodes old bone and replaces it with new bone at the same rate.
Osteoporosis is a disease in which the bones gradually become thin and fragile, and more likely to break (fracture).
It happens when not enough new bone grows to replace the bone that is naturally broken down.
Osteoporosis is more common in women after the menopause, when the levels of the female hormone oestrogen fall, since oestrogen helps to keep bones healthy.
The active substances in Fosavance are alendronate and colecalciferol (vitamin D3).
Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that has been used in osteoporosis since the mid-1990s.
It stops the action of the osteoclasts, the cells that are involved in breaking down the bone tissue.

Vitamin D3 is a nutrient that is found in some foods, but is also made in the skin through exposure to natural sunlight.
Vitamin D3, along with other forms of vitamin D, is required for calcium absorption and normal bone formation.
Since patients with osteoporosis may not get enough vitamin D3 through exposure to sunlight, it is included in Fosavance.
How has Fosavance been studied?
Because alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in authorised medicines in the European Union (EU), the company presented data obtained in earlier studies and from the published literature.
The company also carried out a study in 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis to show Fosavance’ s effectiveness in increasing vitamin D levels.
Patients received either Fosavance 70 mg/ 2,800 IU or alendronate only once a week.
The main measure of effectiveness was the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels after 15 weeks.
This study was extended in 652 patients for a further 24 weeks to compare the effects of continuing with Fosavance 70 mg/ 2,800 IU on its own or adding 2,800 IU vitamin D3 (equivalent to using Fosavance 70 mg/ 5,600 IU).
What benefit has Fosavance shown during the studies?
After 15 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower among the patients treated with Fosavance 70 mg/ 2,800 IU (11%) than among those taking alendronate only (32%).
In the extension study, although similar numbers of patients taking Fosavance 70 mg/ 2,800 IU and Fosavance 70 mg/ 5,600 IU had low vitamin D levels, the patients taking Fosavance 70 mg/ 5,600 IU had greater increases in vitamin D levels over the 24 weeks of the study.
The company also presented evidence that the dose of alendronate included in Fosavance was the same as the dose needed to prevent bone loss.
What is the risk associated with Fosavance?
The most common side effects with Fosavance (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain and gastro-intestinal symptoms such as abdominal (tummy) pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence (wind), oesophageal (gullet) ulcers, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), abdominal distension (swollen tummy) and acid regurgitation.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Fosavance, see the Package Leaflet.
Fosavance should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.
It should not be used where there are abnormalities of the oesophagus (gullet), in patients who have hypocalcaemia (low calcium levels), or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
Why has Fosavance been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Fosavance’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D insufficiency.
The Committee recommended that Fosavance be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Fosavance:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Fosavance to Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. on 24 August 2005.
