Statistical Functions Part Two
FINV function
inverse F probability distribution
mw added one entry
FINV
Returns the inverse of the F-distribution.
The F-distribution is used for F-tests in order to set the relation between two differing data sets.
Syntax:
FINV(Number; DegreesFreedom1; DegreesFreedom2)
Number
is the probability value for which the inverse F-distribution is to be calculated.
DegreesFreedom1
is the number of degrees of freedom in the numerator of the F-distribution.
DegreesFreedom2
is the number of degrees of freedom in the denominator of the F-distribution.
Example:
=FINV(0.5; 5; 10)
yields 0.93.
FISHER function
FISHER
Returns the Fisher transformation for x and creates a function close to a normal distribution.
Syntax:
FISHER(Number)
Number
is the value to be transformed.
Example:
=FISHER(0.5)
yields 0.55.
FISHERINV function
inverse of Fisher transformation
mw added one entry
FISHERINV
Returns the inverse of the Fisher transformation for x and creates a function close to a normal distribution.
Syntax:
FISHERINV(Number)
Number
is the value that is to undergo reverse-transformation.
Example:
=FISHERINV(0.5)
yields 0.46.
FTEST function
FTEST
Returns the result of a F-test.
Syntax:
FTEST(Data1; Data2)
Data1
is the first record array.
Data2
is the second record array.
Example:
=FTEST(A1:A30; B1:B12)
calculates whether the two data sets are different in their variance and returns the probability that both sets could have come from the same total population.
FDIST function
FDIST
Calculates the values of a F-distribution.
Syntax:
FDIST(Number; DegreesFreedom1; DegreesFreedom2)
Number
is the value for which the F-distribution is to be calculated.
DegreesFreedom1
is the degrees of freedom in the numerator in the F-distribution.
DegreesFreedom2
is the degrees of freedom in the denominator in the F-distribution.
Example:
=FDIST(0.8; 8; 12)
yields 0.61.
GAMMA function
GAMMA
Returns the Gamma function value.
Note that GAMMAINV is not the inverse of GAMMA, but of GAMMADIST.
Syntax:
Number
is the number for which the Gamma function value is to be calculated.
GAMMAINV function
GAMMAINV
Returns the inverse of the Gamma cumulative distribution GAMMADIST.
This function allows you to search for variables with different distribution.
Syntax:
GAMMAINV(Number; Alpha; Beta)
Number
is the probability value for which the inverse Gamma distribution is to be calculated.
Alpha
is the parameter Alpha of the Gamma distribution.
Beta
is the parameter Beta of the Gamma distribution.
Example:
=GAMMAINV(0.8; 1; 1)
yields 1.61.
GAMMALN function
natural logarithm of Gamma function
mw added one entry
GAMMALN
Returns the natural logarithm of the Gamma function:
G(x).
Syntax:
GAMMALN(Number)
Number
is the value for which the natural logarithm of the Gamma function is to be calculated.
Example:
=GAMMALN(2)
yields 0.
GAMMADIST function
GAMMADIST
Returns the values of a Gamma distribution.
The inverse function is GAMMAINV.
Syntax:
GAMMADIST(Number; Alpha; Beta; C)
Number
is the value for which the Gamma distribution is to be calculated.
Alpha
is the parameter Alpha of the Gamma distribution.
Beta
is the parameter Beta of the Gamma distribution
C
(optional) = 0 or False calculates the density function
C
= 1 or True calculates the distribution.
Example:
=GAMMADIST(2; 1; 1; 1)
yields 0.86.
GAUSS function
normal distribution; standard
mw added one entry
GAUSS
Returns the standard normal cumulative distribution.
It is GAUSS(x)=NORMSDIST(x)-0.5
Syntax:
GAUSS(Number)
Number
is the value for which the integral value of the standard normal distribution is to be calculated.
Example:
=GAUSS(0.19)
= 0.08
=GAUSS(0.0375)
= 0.01
GEOMEAN function
means;geometric
mw added one entry
GEOMEAN
Returns the geometric mean of a sample.
Syntax:
GEOMEAN(Number1; Number2; ...
Number30)
Number1; Number2; ...
Number30
are 1 to 30 numerical arguments or ranges that represent a random sample.
Example:
=GEOMEAN(23; 46; 69)
= 41.79.
The geometric mean value of this random sample is therefore 41.79.
TRIMMEAN function
means;of data set without margin data
mw added one entry
TRIMMEAN
Returns the mean of a data set without the Alpha percent of data at the margins.
Syntax:
TRIMMEAN(Data; Alpha)
Data
is the array of data in the sample.
Alpha
is the percentage of the marginal data that will not be taken into consideration.
Example:
=TRIMMEAN(A1:A50; 0.1)
calculates the mean value of numbers in A1:A50, excluding the 5 percent of the values representing the highest values and the 5 percent of the values representing the lowest ones.
The percentage numbers refer to the amount of the untrimmed mean value, not to the number of summands.
ZTEST function
ZTEST
Returns the two-tailed P value of a z test with standard distribution.
Syntax:
ZTEST(Data; Number; Sigma)
Data
is the array of the data.
Number
is the value to be tested.
Sigma
(optional) is the standard deviation of the total population.
If this argument is omitted, the standard deviation of the sample in question will be processed.
Example:
=ZTEST(A1:A50; 12)
yields the probability that value 12 belongs to the standard distribution of the total population of data in A1:A50.
HARMEAN function

are 1 to 30 values or ranges that can be used to calculate the harmonic mean.
Example:
=HARMEAN(23; 46; 69)

HYPGEOMDIST(X; NSample; Successes; NPopulation)
X
is the number of results achieved in the random sample.
NSample
is the size of the random sample.
Successes
is the number of possible results in the total population.
NPopulation
is the size of the total population.
Example:
=HYPGEOMDIST(2; 2; 90; 100)
yields 0.81.
If 90 out of 100 pieces of buttered toast fall from the table and land buttered side down, then if 2 pieces of buttered toast are dropped from the table, the probability is 81% that both will land buttered side down.
