Win
The following tips will not assure you to win a game, they are intended as a simple aid.
Look for a single number
When you start a new game, look for a single number, or a number that has no similar numbers that can be placed next to it.
If you have one such number, that piece is a valid starting piece, since you know where it has to be placed.
Note that the bigger the size of the board, the harder is to find such a number.

How to move the pieces on the game board.
Move the pieces
Move a piece
To move a piece, you need to click-and-hold on it, drag it from its current position to its new position, either on the right box or on the left box, and release the mouse button.
These moves are not permanent and can be reversed.
The pieces in the left box can be moved all at once in one direction. See
Avoid the click-and-hold
If you do not feel comfortable with the click-and-hold action to move the pieces, it is possible to change that behavior so that you only have to click on a piece to move it, and click again to release it in its new position.
To do that, from the main menu bar, choose
