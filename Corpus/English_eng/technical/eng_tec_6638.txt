XviD
FFmpeg is an open-source project trying to support most video and audio codecs used these days. Its subproject libavcodec forms the basis for multimedia players such as xine or mplayer.
FFmpeg contains an implementation of the MPEG-4 video encoding standard which produces high quality results.
XviD is a free and open source MPEG-4 video codec. XviD was created by a group of volunteer programmers after the OpenDivX source was closed in July 2001.
XviD features MPEG-4 Advanced Profile settings such as b-frames, global and quarter pixel motion compensation, lumi masking, trellis quantization, and H.263, MPEG and custom quantization matrices.
XviD is a primary competitor of DivX (XviD being DivX spelled backwards). While DivX is closed source and may only run on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, XviD is open source and can potentially run on any platform.
(Description taken from the Wikipedia article)
AC3, better known as Dolby Digital is standardized as ATSC A/ 52. It contains up to 6 total channels of sound.
With this setting K3b will create a two-channel stereo Dolby Digital audio stream.
With this setting K3b will use the Dolby Digital audio stream from the source DVD without changing it.
Use this setting to preserve 5.1 channel sound from the DVD.
MPEG1 Layer III is better known as MP3 and is the most used lossy audio format.
With this setting K3b will create a two-channel stereo MPEG1 Layer III audio stream.

Simulate
If this option is checked K3b will perform all writing steps with the laser turned off. This is useful, for example, to test a higher writing speed or whether your system is able to write on-the-fly. Caution: DVD+R(W) does not support simulated writing.
Only simulate the writing process
Disk at once
If this option is checked, K3b will write the CD in'disk at once 'mode as compared to'track at once' (TAO). It is always recommended to use DAO where possible. Caution: Track pregaps with a length other than 2 seconds are only supported in DAO mode.
Write in disk at once mode
Use Burnfree
Enable Burnfree (or Just Link) to avoid buffer underruns
If this option is checked, K3b enables Burnfree (or Just Link). This is a feature of the CD writer which avoids buffer underruns. Without burnfree, if the writer cannot get any more data a buffer underrun would occur, since the writer needs a constant stream of data to write the CD. With burnfree the writer can mark the current position of the laser and get back to it when the buffer is filled again; but, since this means having little data gaps on the CD, it is highly recommended to always choose an appropriate writing speed to prevent the usage of burnfree, especially for audio CDs (in the worst case one would hear the gap). Burnfree was formerly known as Burnproof, but has since been renamed when it became part of the MMC standard.
Only create image
If this option is checked, K3b will only create an image and not do any actual writing. The image can later be written to a CD/ DVD with most current writing programs (including K3b of course).
Only create an image
Create image
If this option is checked, K3b will create an image before writing the files to the CD/ DVD. Otherwise the data will be written on-the-fly, i. e. no intermediate image will be created. Caution: Although writing on-the-fly should work on most systems, make sure the data is sent to the writer fast enough.
It is recommended to try a simulation first.
Cache the data to be written on the harddisk
Remove image
If this option is checked, K3b will remove any created images after the writing has finished. Uncheck this if you want to keep the images.
Remove images from disk when finished
On the fly
If this option is checked, K3b will not create an image first but write the files directly to the CD/ DVD. Caution: Although this should work on most systems, make sure the data is sent to the writer fast enough.
Write files directly to CD/ DVD without creating an image
Write CD-TEXT
Create CD-TEXT entries
If this option is checked K3b uses some otherwise-unused space on the audio CD to store additional information, such as the artist's name, or the CD title. CD-TEXT is an extension to the audio CD standard introduced by Sony. CD-TEXT will only be usable on CD players that support this extension (mostly car CD players). Since a CD-TEXT-enhanced CD will work in any CD player it is never a bad idea to enable this (if you specify CD-TEXT data.)
Set the paranoia level for reading audio CDs
Sets the correction mode for digital audio extraction.0: No checking, data is copied directly from the drive. 1: Perform overlapped reading to avoid jitter.2: Like 1 but with additional checks of the read audio data.3: Like 2 but with additional scratch detection and repair. The extraction speed reduces from 0 to 3.
Start multisession CD
Do not close the disk to allow additional sessions to be added later
If this option is checked K3b will not close the CD, and will write a temporary table of contents. This allows further sessions to be appended to the CD later.
Normalize volume levels
Adjust the volume levels of all tracks
If this option is checked K3b will adjust the volume of all tracks to a standard level. This is useful for things like creating mixes, where different recording levels on different albums can cause the volume to vary greatly from song to song. Be aware that K3b currently does not support normalizing when writing on the fly.
Verify written data
Compare original with written data
If this option is checked, then after successfully writing the disk K3b will compare the original source data with the written data to verify that the disk has been written correctly.
Ignore read errors
Skip unreadable audio sectors
If this option is checked and K3b is not able to read an audio sector from the source CD it will be replaced with zeros on the resulting copy. Since audio CD Player are able to interpolate small errors in the data it is no problem to let K3b skip unreadable sectors.
Multiple CDDB Entries Found
